  abstract = {Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs)
            are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads–particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)–exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04× speedup (up to 6.91×), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the intersection of music and coding has emerged as a cross-disciplinary approach to engage learners in both musical and computational expression. This article examines the motivations and framing of recent music and coding research through an analysis of 65 articles published between 2004 and 2024. We survey the key findings of this body of work, exploring the extent to which they generalize across diverse populations and educational contexts. We situate these findings within the broader aims of the field of computer science education, critiquing the use of music as a motivational tool in computing education rather than as a topic worthy of exploration in its own right. Methodological limitations are identified, with recommendations for future research to address these gaps. Drawing on theories of onto-epistemic heterogeneity, we call for a more inclusive approach to computing education that integrates sociocultural, historical, and critical perspectives to more effectively support learners from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a critical set of 21st-century skills that young learners must develop to be successful in contemporary work and life. As more K-12 schools begin to integrate CT into the curriculum, Elementary Preservice Teachers (EPSTs) must be prepared to teach CT to their future students. Therefore, elementary teacher preparation programs should explore ways to incorporate CT into their coursework, ensuring that EPSTs graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach CT. This study investigates the impacts of a 3-week CT module implemented in a technology integration course in an elementary teacher preparation program on EPSTs’ CT value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy. The purpose of the module was to introduce EPSTs to basic concepts and big ideas in CT, support their application of CT in block-based coding environments, and promote connection building between CT and authentic real-world scenarios that balance different types of CT activities. Guided by the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG), this study examined EPSTs’ learning as a dynamic process of change across the personal and external domains. The module was located in the external domain as a stimulus for learning, while the Teacher Beliefs about Coding and Computational Thinking (TBaCCT) instrument was used to assess changes in value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy within the personal domain. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to analyze pre- and post-surveys administered to 50 EPSTs and semi-structured interviews with four of the EPSTs. The results showed that the beliefs of the CT value of EPSTs evolved and their self-efficacy and teaching efficacy of CT significantly improved after participating in the module, suggesting that the interaction between external learning experiences and internal belief systems—facilitated by reflection and action—contributed to early professional growth. Notably, EPSTs also developed a more accurate understanding of CT, recognized the benefits of both plugged and unplugged CT activities, and expressed a desire for continued CT learning and professional development. Although EPSTs expressed concerns with the scarcity of physical computing toys in schools, they demonstrated a commitment to incorporating CT activities into their teaching and exploring alternative funding avenues to acquire such resources. Practical implications include potential approaches for elementary teacher preparation programs to embed CT into existing curricula.},

To this end, we construct a mathematical model that periodically estimate an optimal cache division ratio, by considering the factors of the ratios of read/write data amount, the cache hits, and the overhead of data transfer between the storage device and the host. Besides, we propose a scheme of proactive data flushing to write the output data to the underlying flash arrays, without impacts on I/O responsiveness. The trace-driven experiments show that our scheme can improve the overall I/O latency by

We also illustrate their applicability in addressing sufficient completeness problems, emphasising their utility in theoretical and practical contexts.},

To this end, we consider a simple language of monitors that observe sets of system executions and report verdicts w.r.t. a given Hyper-recHML formula. We first employ a unique omniscient monitor that centrally observes all system traces. Since centralised monitors are not ideal for distributed settings, we also provide a language for decentralized monitors, where each trace has a dedicated monitor; these monitors yield a unique verdict by communicating their observations to one another. For both the centralized and the decentralized settings, we provide a synthesis procedure that, given a formula, yields a monitor that is correct (i.e., sound and violation complete). A key step in proving the correctness of the synthesis for decentralized monitors is a result showing that, for each formula, the synthesized centralized monitor and its corresponding decentralized one are weakly bisimilar for a suitable notion of weak bisimulation.},

  abstract = {The remarkable progress of Vision Transformer (ViT) models has significantly advanced performance in computer vision tasks. However, the deployment of ViTs in resource-constrained environments remains a challenge, as the attention computation mechanisms within these models form a significant bottleneck, requiring substantial memory and computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TAFP-ViT, a tailored hardware-software co-design framework for Vision Transformers. On the software level, TAFP-ViT leverages a learnable compressor to perform multi-head shared compression on feature maps, and fuses decompression reconstruction, QKV generation and QKV processing together for calculation, thereby greatly reducing memory and computation requirements. Furthermore, TAFP-ViT combines dynamic inter-layer token pruning to eliminate unimportant tokens and hardware-friendly intra-block row pruning to diminish redundant computations. The proposed software design converts the calculations before and after SoftMax into dense and sparse triple matrix multiplication (TMM) forms respectively. On the hardware level, TAFP-ViT proposes a configurable systolic array (SA) to efficiently adapt to the QKV fusion computation pattern. The SA has flexible PE units that can effectively support general matrix multiplication (GEMM), dense and sparse TMM. The TMM and flexible dataflows allow TAFP-ViT to avoid handling transpositions and storing intermediate computation results, greatly enhancing computational efficiency. Besides, TAFP-ViT innovatively designs a Top-k engine to support dynamic pruning on the fly with high throughput and low resource consumption. Experiments show that the proposed TAFP-ViT achieves remarkable speedups of 123.91×, 29.5×, and 3.01∼ 20.65× compared to conventional CPUs, GPUs, and previous state-of-the-art works, respectively. Additionally, TAFP-ViT reaches a throughput of up to 731.5 GOP/s and an impressive energy efficiency of 77.9 GOPS/W.},

  abstract = {In the past, Arabic Dialects (AD) have been poorly documented linguistically due to the lack of written forms and orthographies. However, in recent years, AD have become more widely used as a means of communication since social media and the everywhere availability of the internet have created a massive overflow of information and textual data, leading to a growing interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for these dialects. The highly inflectional morphology and the lack of standard orthography for AD pose an important challenge for NLP work. In this article, we handle the problem of lacking standard orthography during our work to build a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic (EGY). To identify the guidelines for detecting conventional orthography, we depend on a corpus of 597,000 words that were gathered from various sources and genres. While analyzing the corpus morphologically, we handle the conventional orthography problem by assigning each word the conventional EGY Lemma and stem as close as possible to the EGY pronunciation no matter how it is typically written. Nevertheless, there are some common phenomena and complex cases involved in detecting conventional orthography during the morphological annotation process. Therefore, we take a closer look at and discuss these common phenomena and complex cases as we detect conventional orthography. These conventional orthographies are represented in a manner that facilitates the parsing of them correctly by the morphological analyzer. We tested the coverage of our morphological analyzer and compared it to one of the state-of-the-art morphological analyzers.},

Continuous monitoring of sleep posture, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movement is crucial for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders. Current monitoring solutions often disrupt natural sleep due to discomfort or raise privacy and instrumentation concerns. We introduce PillowSense, a fabric-based sleep monitoring system seamlessly integrated into a pillowcase. PillowSense utilizes a dual-layer fabric design. The top layer comprises conductive fabrics for sensing electrocardiogram (ECG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG), while the bottom layer features pressure-sensitive fabrics to monitor sleep location and movement. The system processes ECG and sEMG signals sequentially to infer multiple sleep variables and incorporates an adversarial neural network to enhance posture classification accuracy. We fabricate prototypes using off-the-shelf hardware and conduct both lab-based and in-the-wild longitudinal user studies to evaluate the system's effectiveness. Across 151 nights and 912.2 hours of real-world sleep data, the system achieves an F1 score of 88% for classifying seven sleep postures, and clinically-acceptable accuracy in vital sign monitoring. PillowSense's comfort, washability, and robustness in multi-user scenarios underscore its potential for unobtrusive, large-scale sleep monitoring.},

We propose a novel generalization of Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games to hybrid-dynamic logics which is direct and fully modular: parameterized by the features of the hybrid language we wish to include, for instance, the modal and hybrid language operators as well as first-order existential quantification. We use these games to establish a new modular Fraïssé-Hintikka theorem for hybrid-dynamic propositional logic and its various fragments. We study the relationship between countable game equivalence (determined by countable Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games) and bisimulation (determined by countable back-and-forth systems). In general, the former turns out to be weaker than the latter, but under certain conditions on the language, the two coincide. As a corollary we obtain an analogue of the Hennessy-Milner theorem. We also prove that for reachable image-finite Kripke structures elementary equivalence implies isomorphism.},

Our characterization applies to all Tarskian logics, that is, all logics with a classical model-theoretic semantics, and hence a wide variety of formalisms were used in knowledge representation and beyond, including many for which a model-theoretic characterization has hitherto been lacking. Our starting point is the approach by Katsuno and Mendelzon (K&amp;M), who provided such a characterization for propositional logic over finite signatures. We generalize K&amp;M’s approach to the setting of AGM-style revision over bases in arbitrary Tarskian logics, where
                    base
                    may refer to one of the various ways of representing an agent’s beliefs (such as belief sets, arbitrary or finite sets of sentences, or single sentences). Our first core result is a representation theorem providing a two-way correspondence between AGM-style revision operators and specific
                    assignments
                    : functions associating every base to a “preference” relation over interpretations, which must be total but is—in contrast to prior approaches—not always transitive. As our second core contribution, we provide a characterization of all logics for which our result can be strengthened to assignments producing transitive preference relations (as in K&amp;M’s original work). Alongside these main contributions, we discuss diverse variants of our findings as well as ramifications for other areas of belief revision theory.},

            *
            is equal to RE, a class including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP
            *
            can share unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works [53, 54] have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers’ shared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive system MIP

            O
            (1), where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show that noise completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share arbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is equivalent to NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) [53]. We also show that this collapse in power is due to noise, rather than the
            O
            (1) answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class the full power of RE = MIP

First, we give a new, deterministic tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided that it has a low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded third-order Fréchet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continuous.},

  abstract = {Barrier potentials gained popularity as a means for robust contact handling in physical modeling and for modeling self-avoiding shapes. The key to the success of these approaches is adherence to geometric constraints, i.e., avoiding intersections, which are the cause of most robustness problems in complex deformation simulation with contact. However, existing barrier-potential methods may lead to spurious forces and imperfect satisfaction of the geometric constraints. They may have strong resolution dependence, requiring careful adaptation of the potential parameters to the object discretizations.
          We present a systematic derivation of a continuum potential defined for smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces, starting from identifying a set of natural requirements for contact potentials, including the barrier property, locality, differentiable dependence on shape, and absence of forces in rest configurations. Our potential is formulated independently of surface discretization and addresses the shortcomings of existing potential-based methods while retaining their advantages.
          We present a discretization of our potential that is a drop-in replacement for the potential used in the incremental potential contact formulation [Li et al. 2020], and compare its behavior to other potential formulations, demonstrating that it has the expected behavior. The presented formulation connects existing barrier approaches, as all recent existing methods can be viewed as a variation of the presented potential, and lays a foundation for developing alternative (e.g., higher-order) versions.},

  abstract = {When working to build machines that have a form of intelligence, it is natural to be inspired by human intelligence. Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector represent a large fraction of global emissions and must be significantly curtailed to achieve ambitious climate goals. To stimulate the adoption of relevant technologies such as rooftop PV and heat pumps, governments and utilities have designed
            incentives
            that encourage adoption of decarbonization technologies. However, studies have shown that many of these incentives are inefficient since a substantial fraction of spending does not actually promote adoption. Further, these incentives are not equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups. In this article, we present a novel data-driven approach that adopts a holistic, emissions-based, and city-scale perspective on decarbonization. We propose an optimization model that dynamically allocates a total incentive budget to households to directly maximize the resultant
            carbon emissions reduction
            – this is in contrast to prior work, which focuses on metrics such as the number of new installations. We leverage techniques from the multi-armed bandits problem to estimate
            human factors
            , such as a household’s willingness to adopt new technologies given a certain incentive. We apply our proposed dynamic incentive framework to a city in the Northeast U.S., using real household energy data, grid carbon intensity data, and future price scenarios. We compare our learning-based technique to two baselines, one “status-quo” baseline using incentives offered by a state and utility, and one simple heuristic baseline. With these baselines, we show that our learning-based technique significantly outperforms both the status-quo baseline and the heuristic baseline, achieving up to 37.88% higher carbon reductions than the status-quo baseline and up to 28.76% higher carbon reductions compared to the heuristic baseline. Additionally, our incentive allocation approach is able to achieve significant carbon reduction even in a broad set of environments, with varying values for electricity and gas prices, and for carbon intensity of the grid. Finally, we show that our framework can accommodate
            equity-aware
            constraints to preserve an equitable allocation of incentives across socioeconomic groups while achieving 83.34% of the carbon reductions of the optimal solution on average.},

  abstract = {A formal context consists of objects, properties, and the incidence relation between them. Various notions of concepts defined with respect to formal contexts and their associated algebraic structures have been studied extensively, including formal concepts in formal concept analysis (FCA), rough concepts arising from rough set theory (RST), and semiconcepts and protoconcepts for dealing with negation. While all these kinds of concepts are associated with lattices, semiconcepts and protoconcepts additionally yield an ordered algebraic structure, called double Boolean algebras. As the name suggests, a double Boolean algebra contains two underlying Boolean algebras.
          
            In this article, we investigate logical and algebraic aspects of the representation and reasoning about different concepts with respect to formal contexts. We first review our previous work on two-sorted modal logic systems

            KF

            BM
            , in which semiconcepts and protoconcepts are also expressible. Based on the logical representation of semiconcepts and protoconcepts, we prove the characterization of double Boolean algebras in terms of their underlying Boolean algebras.

A key ingredient is that star-free closure coincides with another closure operator, defined in terms of regular operations where Kleene stars are allowed in restricted contexts.
          
          A consequence of this first result is that we can decide membership of a regular language in the star-free closure of a class whose separation problem is decidable. Moreover, we prove that separation itself is decidable for the star-free closure of any finite class, and of any class of group languages having itself decidable separation (plus mild additional properties). We actually show decidability of a stronger property, called covering.},

Computational cooling of qubits, whereby a subset of the qubits is cooled at the expense of heating the other qubits via the application of special sets of logic gates, offers a route to effectively cool qubits. Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.},

If the sentence is not credible, then the original belief set remains unchanged. In this article, we introduce a novel constructive method for two-level credibility-limited revision operators, based on a modified version of entrenchment relations. Additionally, we propose a semantics for this type of operators, based on Grove’s systems of spheres. Furthermore, we present axiomatic characterizations for the newly proposed operators.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has expanded its influence far beyond traditional boundaries in our society. One prominent application of artificial intelligence is the use of large language models, which have transcended their initial roles in high-tech industries and academic research and are now actively utilized by individual users. These models have continually improved over the years in their generative capabilities and performance across numerous tasks. However, they still pose a persistent risk of reproducing biases and stereotypes. Previous research has predominantly focused on quantitatively measuring biases in these large language models. In this study, we seek to assess not just the presence of bias itself, but the perception of stereotypes by these models via in-depth exploration of their responses. We demonstrate how the computational grounded theory framework, which integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, can be applied in this context to assess the conceptualization of stereotypes. Furthermore, we contrast language model results with a survey of 400 human participants who also completed similar prompts as the model in order to understand people’s perception of gender stereotypes. The results indicate substantial similarities between language model and human perceptions of stereotypes, highlighting that a model’s perception stems from societal perception of stereotypes.},

Three use cases showcase applications of the framework in real-world scenarios. The ultimate goal of this paper is to encourage transdisciplinary thinking in cybersecurity and any other discipline.

Next, we prove that specific hybrid hypersequent calculi are sound and weakly complete with respect to credulous consequence based on Łukaszewicz extensions. Lastly, we propose a hypersequent-based decision method for skeptical consequence which circumvents the need for early computation of all extensions.},

Recognizing the potential of DG to significantly influence diagnostic and prognostic models in cancer studies and clinical practice, we present this survey along with guidelines on achieving DG in CPath. We rigorously define various DS types, systematically review and categorize existing DG approaches and resources in CPath, and provide insights into their advantages, limitations, and applicability. We also conduct thorough benchmarking experiments with 28 cutting-edge DG algorithms to address a complex DG example problem. Our findings suggest that careful experiment design and Stain Augmentation technique can be very effective. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for DG in CPath. Therefore, we establish guidelines for detecting and managing DS in different scenarios. While most of the concepts and recommendations are given for applications in CPath, they apply to most medical image analysis tasks as well.},

  abstract = {Spatial dataflow architectures (SDAs) are a promising and versatile accelerator platform. They are software-programmable and achieve near-ASIC performance and energy efficiency, beating CPUs by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, many SDAs struggle to efficiently implement irregular computations because they suffer from an
            abstraction inversion
            : they fail to capture coarse-grain dataflow semantics in the application — namely asynchronous communication, pipelining, and queueing — that are naturally supported by the dataflow execution model and existing SDA hardware.
          
          
            Ripple is a language and architecture that corrects the abstraction inversion by preserving dataflow semantics down the stack. Ripple provides
            asynchronous iterators
            , shared-memory atomics, and a familiar task-parallel interface to concisely express the asynchronous pipeline parallelism enabled by an SDA. Ripple efficiently implements deadlock-free, asynchronous task communication by exposing hardware token queues in its ISA. Across nine important workloads, compared to a recent ordered-dataflow SDA, Ripple shrinks programs by 1.9×, improves performance by 3×, increases IPC by 58%, and reduces dynamic instructions by 44%.},

Although many efforts have been made to advance BPIQA from both conducting psychophysical experiments and designing performance-driven objective algorithms,

            few samples

            , where we carefully design three types of experiments via investigating the gap between BPIQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA), the necessity of specific design in BPIQA models, and the generalization ability of BPIQA models. From extensive experiments, we find that easy databases narrow the gap between the performance of BPIQA and BIQA models, which is unconducive to the development of BPIQA. And the easy databases make the BPIQA models be closed to saturation; therefore, the effectiveness of the associated specific designs cannot be well verified. Besides, the BPIQA models trained on our recently proposed databases with complicated degradation show better generalization ability. Thus, we believe that much more efforts are highly desired to put into BPIQA from both subjective viewpoint and objective viewpoint.},

But to define a QCSP model, the alternation of quantifiers must be formerly known and cannot be built dynamically even if the worst case will not occur. To overcome this issue, the new QCHR formalism, that allows to generate quantifiers dynamically during the solving, is defined. QCHR models exhibit state-of-the-art performances on a priori fixed alternation of quantifiers and outperforms previous QCSP approaches when the generation of quantifiers is dynamic.},

To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments.

Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours.

In the realm of arbitrary items of information (infons), conjunction, disjunction, and implication may seem to correspond (set-theoretically) to union, intersection, and relative complementation. But, while infons are closed under union, they are not closed under intersection or relative complementation. It turns out that there is a systematic transformation of propositional intuitionistic calculi to the original (propositional) primal calculi; we call it flatting. We extend flatting to quantifier rules, obtaining arguably the right quantified primal logic (QPL). The QPL entailment problem is exponential-time complete, but it is polynomial-time complete in the case, of importance to applications (at least to access control), where the number of quantifiers is bounded.},

We provide semantical characterizations for both problems, obtain complexity bounds, and discuss the relationship with their set semantics counterparts. Finally, we revisit both problems under a modified distribution model that takes advantage of a linear order on compute nodes and obtain tight complexity bounds.},

  abstract = {Over the years, interest in computational storage devices has been growing steadily. This is largely due to the rise of data-intensive applications, such as machine learning, online video distribution, astrophysics, and genomics. Moving compute operations closer to the data provides benefits in terms of scaling possibilities and energy efficiency. The development of computational storage devices has been limited by the need for specialized and complex hardware. In this work, we propose a portable Linux-based firmware framework for the development of NVMe computational storage devices. Our firmware runs on a variety of hardware platforms ranging from expensive FPGA solutions to inexpensive off-the-shelf single board computers. The firmware leverages the vast Linux software ecosystem to facilitate the development and prototyping of novel computational storage devices. We benchmark our firmware on multiple hardware platforms and demonstrate its versatility through several computational examples including a content-aware disk image search engine based on natural language processing and AI-driven image recognition.},

The pseudonymous data allowed us to explore three research questions: 1) What are the experiences of adult children as informal helpers for elderly parents? 2) How do adult children currently manage their role as informal helpers? and 3) How might digital technology facilitate communication between aging parents and adult children as informal helpers? Our findings lead to a number of design considerations for technologies that support adult children caring for parents who are aging in place, including: building common ground, establishing boundaries, addressing guilt, encouraging in-person communication, community support for adult children, and adapting to changes in role reciprocity.},

We refine our methods on small-scale webdata as a testbed and then generalize the interventions to a large-scale webgraph containing 93.9M domains and 1.6B edges. We demonstrate that our methods penalize unreliable domains far more than reliable domains in both settings and we explore multiple avenues to mitigate unintended effects on both the small-scale and large-scale webgraph experiments. These results indicate the potential of our approach to reduce the spread of misinformation and foster a more reliable online information ecosystem.

            One reason for this is that teaching “Formal Methods” is often confused with teaching logic and theory. This article advocates what we call
            FM thinking
            : the application of ideas from

            should be part of the recommended curriculum for every Computer Science student, for even students who train only in that “thinking” will become much better programmers. However, there will be others who, exposed to those ideas, will be ideally positioned to go further into the more theoretical background: why the techniques work, how they can be automated, and how new ones can be developed. Those students would follow subsequently a specialised, more theoretical stream, including topics such as semantics, logics, verification and proof-automation techniques.},

            , defining some property of the modified part of the graph, and the
            target sentence
            , defining some property of the resulting graph. In our framework, modulator sentences are in counting monadic second-order logic (

            FO
            ) properties. Our logic captures problems that are not definable in FO and, moreover, may have instances of unbounded treewidth. Our main result is that, for this compound logic, model-checking can be done in quadratic time on minor-free graphs. The proposed logic can be seen as a general framework to capitalize on the potential of the
            irrelevant vertex technique
            . It gives a way to deal with problem instances of unbounded treewidth, for which Courcelle’s theorem does not apply.

Existing techniques for checkpointing and restoring session states, such as OS-level memory snapshot or application-level session dump, are insufficient: checkpointing can incur prohibitive storage costs and may fail, while restoration can only be inefficiently performed from scratch by fully loading checkpoint files.
          
          
            In this paper, we introduce a new notebook system, Kishu, that offers time-traveling to and from arbitrary notebook states using an efficient and fault-tolerant incremental checkpoint and checkout mechanism. Kishu creates incremental checkpoints that are small and correctly preserve complex inter-variable dependencies at a novel
            Co-variable
            granularity. Then, to return to a previous state, Kishu accurately identifies the
            state difference
            between the current and target states to perform incremental checkout at sub-second latency with minimal data loading. Kishu is compatible with 146 object classes from popular data science libraries (e.g., Ray, Spark, PyTorch), and reduces checkpoint size and checkout time by up to 4.55× and 9.02×, respectively, on a variety of notebooks.},

  abstract = {Bending-active structures are composed of elastic elements that deform to achieve a desired target shape. To support effective design, inverse algorithms have been proposed that optimize the geometry of each element specifically for each design. This makes it difficult to reuse elements across designs or gain efficiency in fabrication through mass production.
          We address this issue and propose a computational framework to rationalize bending-active structures into a sparse kit of parts. Our method solves for the optimal part geometry such that multiple input designs can be faithfully realized with the same kit of parts. Assigning parts to different assemblies leads to a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive search intractable. Instead, we propose a relaxed continuous optimization incorporating a physics-based simulation in its inner loop to model the elastic deformation of the bending-active structure accurately. Our algorithm allows analyzing different design trade-offs of a kit of parts to tune the balance between fabrication complexity and fidelity to the original designs. We demonstrate our method on three different classes of bending-active structures, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach for part reuse and sustainable practices in fabrication-driven design.},

While progress has been made with communication skills training for clinicians, significant gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting. Advancements in ubiquitous technology and natural language processing make it possible to realize more objective, real-time assessment of clinical interactions and in turn provide more timely feedback to clinicians about their communication effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CommSense, a computational sensing framework that combines smartwatch audio and transcripts with natural language processing methods to measure selected "best-practice'' communication metrics captured by wearable devices in the context of palliative care interactions, including understanding, empathy, presence, emotion, and clarity. We conducted a pilot study involving N=40 clinician participants, to test the technical feasibility and acceptability of CommSense in a simulated clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that CommSense effectively captures most communication metrics and is well-received by both practicing clinicians and student trainees. Our study also highlights the potential for digital technology to enhance communication skills training for healthcare providers and students, ultimately resulting in more equitable delivery of healthcare and accessible, lower cost tools for training with the potential to improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The width complexity measure plays a central role in resolution and other propositional proof systems like Polynomial Calculus (under the name of degree). The study of width lower bounds is the most used method for proving size lower bounds, and it is known that for the mentioned proof systems, proofs with small width also imply the existence of proofs with small size. Not much has been studied, however, about the width parameter in the cutting planes (CP) proof system, a measure that was introduced by Dantchev and Martin in 2009 under the name of CP cutwidth.
          
            In this article, we study the width complexity of CP refutations of graph isomorphism formulas. For a pair of non-isomorphic graphs
            
              \(G\)

            of the graphs and the width of a CP refutation for the corresponding isomorphism formula
            
              \(\mathrm{Iso}(G,H)\)

We also obtain polynomial-length CP refutations from our width bound for isomorphism formulas for graphs with constant Weisfeiler–Leman dimension. Furthermore, we notice that a length lower bound for refuting graph isomorphism formulas in the subsystem of tree-like cutting planes with polynomially bounded coefficients follows from known results.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the problem of checking invariant properties for a large class of symbolic transition systems defined by a combination of SMT theories and quantifiers. State variables can be functions from an uninterpreted sort (finite but unbounded) to an interpreted sort, such as the integers under the theory of linear arithmetic. This formalism is very expressive and can be used for modeling parameterized systems, array-manipulating programs, and more. We propose two algorithms for finding universal inductive invariants for such systems. The first algorithm combines an IC3-style loop with a form of implicit predicate abstraction to construct an invariant in an incremental manner. The second algorithm constructs an under-approximation of the original problem and searches for a formula which is an inductive invariant for this case; then, the invariant is generalized to the original case and checked with a portfolio of techniques. We have implemented the two algorithms and conducted an extensive experimental evaluation, considering various benchmarks and different tools from the literature. As far as we know, our method is the first capable of handling in a large class of systems in a uniform way. The experiment shows that both algorithms are competitive with the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Event structures have emerged as a foundational model for concurrent computation, explaining computational processes by outlining the events and the relationships that dictate their execution. They play a pivotal role in the study of key aspects of concurrent computation models, such as causality and independence, and have found applications across a broad range of languages and models, spanning realms like persistence, probabilities, and quantum computing. Recently, event structures have been extended to address reversibility, where computational processes can undo previous computations. In this context, reversible event structures provide abstract representations of processes capable of both forward and backward steps in a computation. Since their introduction, event structures have played a crucial role in bridging operational models, traditionally exemplified by Petri nets and process calculi, with denotational ones, i.e., algebraic domains. In this context, we revisit the standard connection between Petri nets and event structures under the lenses of reversibility. Specifically, we introduce a subset of contextual Petri nets, dubbed
            reversible causal nets
            , that precisely correspond to reversible prime event structures. The distinctive feature of reversible causal nets lies in deriving causality from inhibitor arcs, departing from the conventional dependence on the overlap between the postset and preset of transitions. In this way, we are able to operationally explain the full model of reversible prime event structures.},

The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis.

Our approach utilizes the interaction between a CDCL SAT solver and a special symmetry propagator where the SAT solver runs on an encoding of the desired graph property. The symmetry propagator checks partially generated graphs for minimality with respect to a lexicographic ordering during the solving process. This approach has several advantages over a static symmetry breaking: (i) symmetries are detected early in the generation process, (ii) symmetry breaking is seamlessly integrated into the CDCL procedure, and (iii) the propagator performs a complete symmetry breaking without causing a prohibitively large initial encoding. We instantiate our approach by generating extremal graphs with certain restrictions in terms of forbidden subgraphs and diameter. In particular, we could confirm the Murty–Simon Conjecture (1979) on diameter-2-critical graphs for graphs up to 19 vertices and prove the exact number of Ramsey graphs

  abstract = {Illusion-knit fabrics reveal distinct patterns or images depending on the viewing angle. Artists have manually achieved this effect by exploiting "microgeometry," i.e., small differences in stitch heights. However, past work in computational 3D knitting does not model or exploit designs based on stitch height variation. This paper establishes a foundation for exploring illusion knitting in the context of computational design and fabrication. We observe that the design space is highly constrained, elucidate these constraints, and derive strategies for developing effective, machine-knittable illusion patterns. We partially automate these strategies in a new interactive design tool that reduces difficult patterning tasks to familiar image editing tasks. Illusion patterns also uncover new fabrication challenges regarding mixed colorwork and texture; we describe new algorithms for mitigating fabrication failures and ensuring high-quality knit results.},

  abstract = {Surface-based inflatables are composed of two thin layers of nearly inextensible sheet material joined together along carefully selected fusing curves. During inflation, pressure forces separate the two sheets to maximize the enclosed volume. The fusing curves restrict this expansion, leading to a spatially varying in-plane contraction and hence metric frustration. The inflated structure settles into a 3D equilibrium that balances pressure forces with the internal elastic forces of the sheets.
          We present a computational framework for analyzing and designing surface-based inflatable structures with arbitrary fusing patterns. Our approach employs numerical homogenization to characterize the behavior of parametric families of periodic inflatable patch geometries, which can then be combined to tessellate the sheet with smoothly varying patterns. We propose a novel parametrization of the underlying deformation space that allows accurate, efficient, and systematical analysis of the stretching and bending behavior of inflated patches with potentially open boundaries.
          We apply our homogenization algorithm to create a database of geometrically diverse fusing patterns spanning a wide range of material properties and deformation characteristics. This database is employed in an inverse design algorithm that solves for fusing curves to best approximate a given input target surface. Local patches are selected and blended to form a global network of curves based on a geometric flattening algorithm. These fusing curves are then further optimized to minimize the distance of the deployed structure to target surface. We show that this approach offers greater flexibility to approximate given target geometries compared to previous work while significantly improving structural performance.},

  abstract = {While conventional cameras offer versatility for applications ranging from amateur photography to autonomous driving, computational cameras allow for domain-specific adaption. Cameras with co-designed optics and image processing algorithms enable high-dynamic-range image recovery, depth estimation, and hyperspectral imaging through optically encoding scene information that is otherwise undetected by conventional cameras. However, this optical encoding creates a challenging inverse reconstruction problem for conventional image recovery, and often lowers the overall photographic quality. Thus computational cameras with domain-specific optics have only been adopted in a few specialized applications where the captured information cannot be acquired in other ways. In this work, we investigate a method that combines two optical systems into one to tackle this challenge. We split the aperture of a conventional camera into two halves: one which applies an application-specific modulation to the incident light via a diffractive optical element to produce a coded image capture, and one which applies no modulation to produce a conventional image capture. Co-designing the phase modulation of the split aperture with a dual-pixel sensor allows us to simultaneously capture these coded and uncoded images without increasing physical or computational footprint. With an uncoded conventional image alongside the optically coded image in hand, we investigate image reconstruction methods that are conditioned on the conventional image, making it possible to eliminate artifacts and compute costs that existing methods struggle with. We assess the proposed method with 2-in-1 cameras for optical high-dynamic-range reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, and hyperspectral imaging, comparing favorably to all tested methods in all applications.},

  abstract = {Random testing approaches work by generating inputs at random, or by selecting inputs randomly from some pre-defined operational profile. One long-standing question that arises in this and other testing contexts is as follows: When can we stop testing? At what point can we be certain that executing further tests in this manner will not explore previously untested (and potentially buggy) software behaviors? This is analogous to the question in Machine Learning, of how many training examples are required in order to infer an accurate model. In this paper we show how probabilistic approaches to answer this question in Machine Learning (arising from Computational Learning Theory) can be applied in our testing context. This enables us to produce an upper bound on the number of tests that are required to achieve a given level of adequacy. We are the first to enable this from only knowing the number of coverage targets (e.g. lines of code) in the source code, without needing to observe a sample test executions. We validate this bound on a large set of Java units, and an autonomous driving system.},

A total of 29 studies, reporting from 42 comparisons of CTA and RTA, matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analyses.

Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have not yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial domains, including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality, such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, the task-agnostic large learning models (LLMs) can outperform task-specific fully supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image–based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing FMs still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing an FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodal nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal FM that can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this article by discussing the unique risks and challenges to developing such a model for GeoAI.},

  abstract = {Time series data are widely used and provide a wealth of information for countless applications. However, some applications are faced with a limited amount of data, or the data cannot be used due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these obstacles, time series can be generated synthetically. For example, electrocardiograms can be synthesized to make them available for building models to predict conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia without leaking patient information. Although many different approaches to time series synthesis have been proposed, evaluating the quality of synthetic time series data poses unique challenges and remains an open problem, as there is a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a “good” synthesis. To this end, we present a comprehensive literature survey to identify different aspects of synthesis quality and their relationships. Based on this, we propose a definition of synthesis quality and a systematic evaluation procedure for assessing it. With this work, we aim to provide a common language and criteria for evaluating synthetic time series data. Our goal is to promote more rigorous and reproducible research in time series synthesis by enabling researchers and practitioners to generate high-quality synthetic time series data.},

(Unfortunately, the other 2023 recipient, Dr. Dean Leitersdorf, could not contribute this time, due to outside constraints.)
          Dr. Siddartha Jayanti's thesis comprises novel results in the scope of distributed and concurrent synchronization. The thesis, and Siddartha's work in general, is remarkable for both its depth and breadth: as you can see in the overview, the work incorporates technical results spanning from multi-processor synchronization to finding equilibria in multiplayer games! Another remarkable aspect is Siddartha's commitment to broadening participation in STEM, specifically to expanding science availability by writing what appears to be the first research paper in the Telugu language. It is also worth noting that Siddartha is part of the second generation of Distributed Computing researchers from his family. (As readers probably know, his father is Prof. Prasad Jayanti.)
          The strength and diversity of the 2023 awarded theses, together with the fact that PODC has received a record number of submissions this year, suggest that the future is bright for our area.},

The player also incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., when they increase or decrease their purchasing amount. We introduce competitive (robust) threshold-based algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem, and show they are optimal among deterministic online algorithms. We then propose learning-augmented algorithms that take advantage of untrusted black-box advice (such as predictions from a machine learning model) to achieve significantly better average-case performance without sacrificing worst-case competitive guarantees. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms using a carbon-aware EV charging case study, showing that our algorithms substantially improve on baseline methods for this problem.},

This online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms.

  abstract = {Differentiable rendering methods promise the ability to optimize various parameters of three-dimensional (3D) scenes to achieve a desired result. However, lighting design has so far received little attention in this field. In this article, we introduce a method that enables continuous optimization of the arrangement of luminaires in a 3D scene via differentiable light tracing. Our experiments show two major issues when attempting to apply existing methods from differentiable path tracing to this problem: First, many rendering methods produce images, which restricts the ability of a designer to define lighting objectives to image space. Second, most previous methods are designed for scene geometry or material optimization and have not been extensively tested for the case of optimizing light sources. Currently available differentiable ray-tracing methods do not provide satisfactory performance, even on fairly basic test cases in our experience. In this article, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, a novel adjoint light tracing method that overcomes these challenges and enables gradient-based lighting design optimization in a view-independent (camera-free) way. Thus, we allow the user to paint illumination targets directly onto the 3D scene or use existing baked illumination data (e.g., light maps). Using modern ray-tracing hardware, we achieve interactive performance. We find light tracing advantageous over path tracing in this setting, as it naturally handles irregular geometry, resulting in less noise and improved optimization convergence. We compare our adjoint gradients to state-of-the-art image-based differentiable rendering methods. We also demonstrate that our gradient data works with various common optimization algorithms, providing good convergence behaviour. Qualitative comparisons with real-world scenes underline the practical applicability of our method.},

CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

This is a pivotal task for conversational analysis, given the ubiquity and challenges of politeness in interactions. The computational approach to politeness has witnessed great interest from the conversational analysis community. This article is a compilation of past works in computational politeness in natural language processing. We view four milestones in the research so far,
            viz.
            supervised and weakly supervised feature extraction to identify and induce politeness in a given text, incorporation of context beyond the target text, study of politeness across different social factors, and study the relationship between politeness and various socio-linguistic cues. In this article, we describe the datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in computational politeness research. We also discuss representative performance values and provide pointers to future works, as given in the prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state of the art, this survey presents several valuable illustrations—most prominently, a table summarizing the past papers along different dimensions, such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.},

  abstract = {Separation logic’s compositionality and local reasoning properties have led to significant advances in scalable static analysis. But program analysis has new challenges—many programs displaycomputational effectsand, orthogonally, static analyzers must handleincorrectnesstoo. We present Outcome Separation Logic (OSL), a program logic that is sound for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning in programs with varying effects. OSL has a frame rule—just like separation logic—but uses different underlying assumptions that open up local reasoning to a larger class of properties than can be handled by any single existing logic.Building on this foundational theory, we also define symbolic execution algorithms that use bi-abduction to derive specifications for programs with effects. This involves a newtri-abductionprocedure to analyze programs whose execution branches due to effects such as nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. This work furthers the compositionality promised by separation logic by opening up the possibility for greater reuse of analysis tools across two dimensions: bug-finding vs verification in programs with varying effects.},

Despite global efforts in breast cancer prevention and control, the scarcity of literature poses an obstacle to a complete understanding in this area of interest. The methodologies studied were systematic mapping and systematic literature review. For each article, the journal, conference, year of publication, dataset, breast cancer characteristics, PET/CT processing techniques, metrics and diagnostic yield results were identified. Sixty-four articles were analyzed, 44 (68.75%) belong to journals and 20 (31.25%) belong to the conference category. A total of 102 techniques were identified, which were distributed in preprocessing with 7 (6.86%), segmentation with 15 (14.71%), feature extraction with 15 (14.71%), and classification with 65 (63.73%). The techniques with the highest incidence identified in each stage are: Gaussian Filter, SLIC, Local Binary Pattern, and Support Vector Machine with 4, 2, 7, and 35 occurrences, respectively. Support Vector Machine is the predominant technique in the classification stage, due to the fact that Artificial Intelligence is emerging in medical image processing and health care to make expert systems increasingly intelligent and obtain favorable results.},

Our findings highlight central considerations around science journalists' user agency, contexts of use, and professional responsibility that such tools can influence and could account for in design.

  abstract = {Border Theory suggests individuals create borders to manage the transitions between work and family (or, more generally, life) domains. The degree of separation or integration of domains across borders has an impact on the balance between work and life. Previous studies have shown individuals who perceive balance between work and life domains tend to be more satisfied with their lives, reporting higher physical and mental health. At times of crisis, such as during a pandemic, borders can be disrupted, affecting work-life balance and leading to a short- or long-term negative impact on well-being. Border theory provides a systematic lens through which to study these changes. However, changes cannot be studied using interviews or diaries as these are not at the scale required when societal disruptions occur. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a computational linguistic approach to operationalize border theory at scale, using readily available social media data. In particular, we make two main contributions. First, we design metrics to measure key characteristics of borders. This involves the application of a transformer-based topic modeling technique, BERTopic, to detect topics from social media data. Second, we apply this operationalization to a case study of around a million tweets posted by nearly two hundred teachers and journalists in the UK from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2022. In so doing, we longitudinally study and compare the changes in borders between work and life before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown periods.},

  abstract = {Undoing computations of a concurrent system is beneficial in many situations, such as in reversible debugging of multi-threaded programs and in recovery from errors due to optimistic execution in parallel discrete event simulation. A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation, including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, and abstract models such as prime event structures and occurrence nets. However, it has not been settled as to what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between various reversibility properties. In particular, we show how all properties we consider are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism, it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new properties related to causal-consistent reversibility, namely causal liveness and causal safety, stating, respectively, that an action can be undone if (causal liveness) and only if (causal safety) it is independent from all of the following actions. These properties come in three flavours: defined in terms of independent transitions, independent events, or via an ordering on events. Both causal liveness and causal safety are derivable from our axioms.},

We first investigate preservation of equivalences and satisfiability of formulas between finite and infinite traces, by providing a set of semantic and syntactic conditions to guarantee when the distinction between reasoning in the two cases can be blurred. Moreover, we show that the satisfiability problem on finite traces for several decidable fragments of first-order temporal logic is

A finite characterisation of a modal formula φ is a finite collection of positive and negative examples that distinguishes φ from every other, non-equivalent modal formula, where an example is a finite pointed Kripke structure. This definition can be restricted to specific frame classes and to fragments of the modal language: a modal fragment ℒ admits finite characterisations with respect to a frame class ℱ if every formula φ ∈ ℒ has a finite characterisation with respect to ℒ consisting of examples that are based on frames in ℱ. Finite characterisations are useful for illustration, interactive specification and debugging of formal specifications, and their existence is a precondition for exact learnability with membership queries. We show that the full modal language admits finite characterisations with respect to a frame class ℱ only when the modal logic of ℱ is locally tabular. We then study which modal fragments, freely generated by some set of connectives, admit finite characterisations. Our main result is that the positive modal language without the truth-constants ⊤ and ⊥ admits finite characterisations w.r.t. the class of all frames. This result is essentially optimal: finite characterisability fails when the language is extended with the truth constant ⊤ or ⊥ or with all but very limited forms of negation.},

While it is usually assumed that Player 1 has a single objective, we consider here the new setting where he has several. In this context, after responding with his strategy, Player 1 gets a payoff in the form of a vector of Booleans corresponding to his satisfied objectives. Rationality of Player 1 is encoded by the fact that his response must produce a Pareto-optimal payoff given the strategy of Player 0. We study for several kinds of ω-regular objectives the Stackelberg-Pareto Synthesis problem which asks whether Player 0 can announce a strategy which satisfies his objective, whatever the rational response of Player 1. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable for games in which objectives are all reachability, safety, Büchi, co-Büchi, Boolean Büchi, parity, Muller, Streett, or Rabin objectives.

One of the main reasons for I/O imbalances is the lack of a global view of system-wide resource consumption. While approaches to address the problem already exist, the diversity of HPC workloads combined with different file striping patterns prevents widespread adoption of these approaches. In addition, load-balancing techniques should be transparent to client applications. To address these issues, we propose
            Tarazu
            , an end-to-end control plane where clients transparently and adaptively write to a set of selected I/O servers to achieve balanced data placement. Our control plane leverages real-time load statistics for global data placement on distributed storage servers, while our design model employs trace-based optimization techniques to minimize latency for I/O load requests between clients and servers and to handle multiple striping patterns in files. We evaluate our proposed system on an experimental cluster for two common use cases: the synthetic I/O benchmark IOR and the scientific application I/O kernel HACC-I/O. We also use a discrete-time simulator with real HPC application traces from emerging workloads running on the Summit supercomputer to validate the effectiveness and scalability of
            Tarazu
            in large-scale storage environments. The results show improvements in load balancing and read performance of up to 33% and 43%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.},

How humans perceive omnidirectional images in an immersive environment and form the immersive quality of experience are important problems. Thus, it is crucial to measure the quality of omnidirectional images under different viewing conditions, which suffer from realistic distortions. In this article, we build a large-scale subjective assessment database for omnidirectional images and carry out a comprehensive psychophysical experiment to study the relationships between different factors (viewing conditions and viewing behaviors) and the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images. In addition, we collect both subjective ratings and head movement data. A thorough analysis of the collected subjective data is also provided, where we make several interesting findings. Moreover, with the proposed database, we propose a novel transformer-based omnidirectional image quality assessment model. To be consistent with the human viewing process, viewing conditions and behaviors are naturally incorporated into the proposed model. Specifically, the proposed model mainly consists of three parts: viewport sequence generation, multi-scale feature extraction, and perceptual quality prediction. Extensive experimental results conducted on the proposed database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing image quality assessment methods.},

Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies’ message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively).

  abstract = {Background and Objective.
            Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?
          
          
            Method.
            This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.
          
          
            Participants.
            Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.
          
          
            Findings.
            Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.
          
          
            Implications.
            Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis.

  abstract = {Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of smart wearable devices. However, variations in different subjects can cause a domain shift that impedes the scaling of the recognition model. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to recognize activities in new, unlabeled target domains by training the source and target data together. However, the need for accessing source data raises privacy concerns. Source-free domain adaptation has emerged as a practical setting, where only a pre-trained source model is provided for the unlabeled target domain. This setup aligns with the need for personalized activity model adaptation on target local devices. As the edge devices are resource-constrained with limited memory, it is crucial to take the computational efficiency, i.e., memory cost into consideration. In this paper, we develop a source-free domain adaptation framework for wearable sensor-based HAR, with a focus on computational efficiency for target edge devices. Firstly, we design a lightweight add-on module called adapter to adapt the frozen pre-trained model to the unlabeled target domain. Secondly, to optimize the adapter, we adopt a simple yet effective model adaptation method that leverages local representation similarity and prediction consistency. Additionally, we design a set of sample selection optimization strategies to select samples effective for adaptation and further enhance computational efficiency while maintaining adaptation performance. Our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the state-of-the-art source free domain adaptation methods with fewer than 1% of the parameters updated and saves up to 4.99X memory cost.},

  abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.
          It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.
          In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of data breaches necessitates robust data protection measures in computational tasks. Secure computation outsourcing (SCO) presents a viable solution by safeguarding the confidentiality of inputs and outputs in data processing without disclosure. Nonetheless, this approach assumes the existence of a trustworthy coordinator to orchestrate and oversee the process, typically implying that data owners must fulfill this role themselves. In this paper, we consider secure delegated data processing (SDDP), an expanded data processing scenario wherein data owners simply delegate their data to SDDP providers for subsequent value mining or other downstream applications, eliminating the necessary involvement of data owners or trusted entities to dive into data processing deeply. However, general-purpose SDDP poses significant challenges in permitting the discretionary execution of computational tasks by SDDP providers on sensitive data while ensuring confidentiality. Existing approaches are insufficient to support SDDP in either efficiency or universality. To tackle this issue, we propose TGCB, a TEE-based General-purpose Computational Backend, designed to endow general-purpose computation with SDDP capabilities from an engineering perspective, powered by TEE-based code integrity and data confidentiality. Central to TGCB is the Encryption Programming Language (EPL) that defines computational tasks in SDDP. Specifically, SDDP providers can express arbitrary computable functions as EPL scripts, processed by TGCB's interfaces, securely interpreted and executed in TEE, ensuring data confidentiality throughout the process. As a universal computational backend, TGCB extensively bolsters data security in existing general-purpose computational tasks, allowing data owners to leverage SDDP without privacy concerns.},

A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media?
          In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns.},

In this problem, a player attempts to find the k lowest (alternatively, highest) prices in a sequence of fixed length T, which is revealed sequentially. At each time step, the player is presented with a price and decides whether to accept or reject it. The player incurs aswitching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., whenever they pause or resume purchasing. This online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms. Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introducedouble-threshold algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem. We further show that the competitive ratios achieved by these algorithms are the best achievable by any deterministic online algorithm. Finally, we empirically validate our proposed algorithm through case studies on the application of carbon-aware load shifting using real carbon trace data and existing baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials enable customizing the elastic properties of physical objects by altering their fine-scale structure. A broad gamut of effective material properties can be produced even from a single fabrication material by optimizing the geometry of a periodic microstructure tiling. Past work has extensively studied the capabilities of microstructures in the small-displacement regime, where periodic homogenization of linear elasticity yields computationally efficient optimal design algorithms. However, many applications involve flexible structures undergoing large deformations for which the accuracy of linear elasticity rapidly deteriorates due to geometric nonlinearities. Design of microstructures at finite strains involves a massive increase in computation and is much less explored; no computational tool yet exists to design metamaterials emulating target hyperelastic laws
            over finite regions of strain space.
          
          We make an initial step in this direction, developing algorithms to accelerate homogenization and metamaterial design for nonlinear elasticity and building a complete framework for the optimal design of planar metamaterials. Our nonlinear homogenization method works by efficiently constructing an accurate interpolant of a microstructure's deformation over a finite space of macroscopic strains likely to be endured by the metamaterial. From this interpolant, the homogenized energy density, stress, and tangent elasticity tensor describing the microstructure's effective properties can be inexpensively computed at any strain. Our design tool then fits the effective material properties to a target constitutive law over a region of strain space using a parametric shape optimization approach, producing a directly manufacturable geometry. We systematically test our framework by designing a catalog of materials fitting isotropic Hooke's laws as closely as possible. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy over traditional linear metamaterial design techniques by fabricating and testing physical prototypes.},

Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this article, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyze its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.},

  abstract = {After almost a decade of research, development of more efficient imprecise computational blocks is still a major concern in imprecise computing domain. There are many instances of the introduced imprecise components of different types, while their main difference is that they propose different precision-cost-performance trade-offs. In this paper, a novel comprehensive model for the imprecise components is introduced, which can be exploited to cover a wide range of precision-cost-performance trade-offs, for different types of imprecise components. The model helps to find the suitable imprecise component based on any desired error criterion. Therefore, the most significant advantage of the proposed model is that it can be simply exploited for design space exploration of different imprecise components to extract the suitable components, with the desired precision-cost-performance trade-off for any specific application. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, two novel families of Lowest-cost Imprecise Adders (LIAs) and Lowest-cost Imprecise Multipliers (LIMs) are introduced in the paper, which are systematically extracted based on exploration of the design space provided by the proposed model. A wide range of simulation and synthesis results are also presented in the paper to prove the comparable efficiency of the systematically extracted LIA/LIM structures with respect to the most efficient existing human-made imprecise components both individually and in a Multiply-Accumulate application.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

  abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) systems display content freely in space, and present nearly arbitrary amounts of information, enabling ubiquitous access to digital information. This approach, however, introduces clutter and distraction if too much virtual content is shown. We present BlendMR, an optimization-based MR system that blends virtual content onto the physical objects in users’ environments to serve as ambient information displays. Our approach takes existing 2D applications and meshes of physical objects as input. It analyses the geometry of the physical objects and identifies regions that are suitable hosts for virtual elements. Using a novel integer programming formulation, our approach then optimally maps selected contents of the 2D applications onto the object, optimizing for factors such as importance and hierarchy of information, viewing angle, and geometric distortion. We evaluate BlendMR by comparing it to a 2D window baseline. Study results show that BlendMR decreases clutter and distraction, and is preferred by users. We demonstrate the applicability of BlendMR in a series of results and usage scenarios.},

  abstract = {Computational modeling has become a widespread approach for studying real-world phenomena by using different modeling perspectives, in particular, the microscopic point of view concentrates on the behavior of the single components and their interactions from which the global system evolution emerges, while the macroscopic point of view represents the system’s overall behavior abstracting as much as possible from that of the single components. The preferred point of view depends on the effort required to develop the model, on the detail level of the available information about the system to be modeled, and on the type of measures that are of interest to the modeler; each point of view may lead to a different modeling language and simulation paradigm. An approach adequate for the microscopic point of view is Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation, which has gained popularity in the last few decades but lacks a formal definition common to the different tools supporting it. This may lead to modeling mistakes and wrong interpretation of the results, especially when comparing models of the same system developed according to different points of view. The aim of the work described in this paper is to provide a common compositional modeling language from which both a macro and a micro simulation model can be automatically derived: these models are coherent by construction and may be studied through different simulation approaches and tools. A framework is thus proposed in which a model can be composed using a Petri Net formalism and then studied through both an Agent-Based Simulation and a classical Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, depending on the study goal.},

  abstract = {The Craig interpolation property (CIP) states that an interpolant for an implication exists iff it is valid. The projective Beth definability property (PBDP) states that an explicit definition exists iff a formula stating implicit definability is valid. Thus, the CIP and PBDP reduce potentially hard existence problems to entailment in the underlying logic. Description (and modal) logics with nominals and/or role inclusions do not enjoy the CIP nor the PBDP, but interpolants and explicit definitions have many applications, in particular in concept learning, ontology engineering, and ontology-based data management. In this article, we show that, even without Beth and Craig, the existence of interpolants and explicit definitions is decidable in description logics with nominals and/or role inclusions such as 𝒜ℒ𝒞𝒪, 𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋ, and 𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋ𝒪ℐ and corresponding hybrid modal logics. However, living without Beth and Craig makes these problems harder than entailment: the existence problems become
            2ExpTime
            -complete in the presence of an ontology or the universal modality, and
            coNExpTime
            -complete otherwise. We also analyze explicit definition existence if all symbols (except the one that is defined) are admitted in the definition. In this case, the complexity depends on whether one considers individual or concept names. Finally, we consider the problem of computing interpolants and explicit definitions if they exist and turn the complexity upper bound proof into an algorithm computing them, at least for description logics with role inclusions.},

            B

            -tree speed performance by equipping it with a larger log, which nevertheless will degrade its crash recovery speed. Such a logging dilemma is particularly prominent in the presence of modern workloads that involve intensive small writes. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, called

            based
            B
            +
            -tree, which leverages the emerging computational storage drive (CSD) with built-in transparent compression to fundamentally resolve the logging dilemma. Our key idea is to divide the large single log into many small (e.g., 4KB), highly compressible
            per-page logs
            , each being statically bounded with a
            B

            -tree does not need to scan any per-page logs, leading to a recovery latency independent from the total log size. We have developed and open-sourced a fully functional prototype. Our evaluation results show that, under small-write intensive workloads, our design solution can improve

            cells
            (i.e., a set of statements) to create variables, train models, visualize results, etc. Unfortunately, existing notebook systems do not offer live migration: when a notebook launches on a new machine, it loses its
            state
            , preventing users from continuing their tasks from where they had left off. This is because, unlike DBMS, the sessions directly rely on underlying kernels (e.g., Python/R interpreters) without an additional data management layer. Existing techniques for preserving states, such as copying all variables or OS-level checkpointing, are unreliable (often fail), inefficient, and platform-dependent. Also, re-running code from scratch can be highly time-consuming.
          
          
            In this paper, we introduce a new notebook system, Elastic-Notebook, that offers live migration via checkpointing/restoration using a novel mechanism that is reliable, efficient, and platform-independent. Specifically, by observing all cell executions via transparent, lightweight monitoring, ElasticNotebook can find a reliable and efficient way (i.e.,
            replication plan
            ) for reconstructing the original session state, considering variable-cell dependencies, observed runtime, variable sizes, etc. To this end, our new graph-based optimization problem finds how to reconstruct all variables (efficiently) from a subset of variables that can be transferred across machines. We show that ElasticNotebook reduces end-to-end migration and restoration times by 85%-98% and 94%-99%, respectively, on a variety (i.e., Kaggle, JWST, and Tutorial) of notebooks with negligible runtime and memory overheads of &lt;2.5% and &lt;10%.},

  abstract = {Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of 'human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for 'critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.},

From this review we identify three key (and still evolving) features: craft's accountabilities to natural materials and local ecologies; craft's holistic ways of making with 'head, heart, and hand'; and craft's distinctly collaborative and embodied styles of teaching and learning. We then show how these lessons can be applied to contemporary practices and pedagogies of computational making. We argue that doing so can help to rebalance computation's ecological ties and relations, recenter its practice on a sensorially rich and 'whole-self' concept of making, and support more collaborative modes of teaching and learning that are inclusive, relational, and heterogeneous.},

We first present and compare three generic benchmark models, inspired by the neuroscience literature, to explain and predict the learning process for shortcut adoption. Results show that they do not account for the complexity of users’ behavior. We then introduce a dedicated model, Transition, combining five cognitive mechanisms: implicit and explicit learning, decay, planning and perseveration. Results show that our model outperforms the three benchmark models both in terms of model fitting and model simulation. Finally, a post-analysis shows that each of the five mechanisms contribute to goodness-of-fit, but the role of perseveration is unclear regarding model simulation.},

  abstract = {The logic of information flows (LIF) is a general framework in which tasks of a procedural nature can be modeled in a declarative, logic-based fashion. The first contribution of this article is to propose semantic and syntactic definitions of inputs and outputs of LIF expressions. We study how the two relate and show that our syntactic definition is optimal in a sense that is made precise. The second contribution is a systematic study of the expressive power of sequential composition in LIF. Our results on composition tie in the results on inputs and outputs and relate LIF to first-order logic (FO) and bounded-variable LIF to bounded- variable FO.

The study analyze the inter-subjectivity concept to the model development from the conceptual level, the benchmark value of the whole setting, multidimensional spacetime, and the leading importance of the Internet governance idea to the reformation of IPE in the colleges and universities. The findings assess the issues with IPE transformation and development in colleges and universities and suggest solutions, as well as four mechanisms of "methodical design underlined in the overview, team-work cooperation of team development, augmentation of environmental development, and double endorsement of quality management”. The concept of developing a” three-stage full atmosphere" network IPE architecture for universities and colleges is presented as one of the remedies to enhance the efficiency of the IPE in universities. This idea is based on experience summary, theoretical analysis, and empirical study. The timeliness concerns of IPE transformation in universities and colleges are resolved by using in-depth comprehension and evaluation of the necessary knowledge of DM-AI, which is then used to apply the appropriate DM-AI methodologies. This allows the relevant administrators to quickly learn the crucial data in complicated problems and suggest solutions for subsequent decision-making.},

  abstract = {Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies.
          
            In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the
            Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive
            and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.},

Because the structures’ “architectures” vary widely—with elements such as beams, thin shells, and solid bulks—it is difficult to explore them using existing representations. Generic approaches like voxel grids are versatile, but it is cumbersome to represent and edit individual structures; architecture-specific approaches address these issues, but are incompatible with one another. By contrast, our procedural graph succinctly represents the construction process for any structure using a simple skeleton annotated with spatially varying thickness. To express the highly constrained
            triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS)
            in this manner, we present the first fully automated version of the conjugate surface construction method, which allows novices to create complex TPMS from intuitive input. We demonstrate our representation’s expressiveness, accuracy, and compactness by constructing a wide range of established structures and hundreds of novel structures with diverse architectures and material properties. We also conduct a user study to verify our representation’s ease-of-use and ability to expand engineers’ capacity for exploration.},

When endowed with the material thickness and bending resistance of a physical wire, these knots settle into equilibrium states that balance the forces induced by elastic deformation and self-contacts of the wire. In general, elastic knots can have many distinct equilibrium states, i.e. they are
            multistable
            mechanical systems. We propose a computational pipeline that combines randomized spatial sampling and physics simulation to efficiently find stable equilibrium states of elastic knots. Leveraging results from knot theory, we run our pipeline on thousands of different topological knot types to create an extensive data set of multistable knots. By applying a series of filters to this data, we discover new transformable knots with interesting geometric and physical properties. A further analysis across knot types reveals geometric and topological patterns, yielding constructive principles that generalize beyond the currently tabulated knot types. We show how multistable elastic knots can be used to design novel deployable structures and engaging recreational puzzles. Several physical prototypes at different scales highlight these applications and validate our simulation.},

  abstract = {Long exposure photography produces stunning imagery, representing moving elements in a scene with motion-blur. It is generally employed in two modalities, producing either a foreground or a background blur effect. Foreground blur images are traditionally captured on a tripod-mounted camera and portray blurred moving foreground elements, such as silky water or light trails, over a perfectly sharp background landscape. Background blur images, also called panning photography, are captured while the camera is tracking a moving subject, to produce an image of a sharp subject over a background blurred by relative motion. Both techniques are notoriously challenging and require additional equipment and advanced skills. In this paper, we describe a computational burst photography system that operates in a hand-held smartphone camera app, and achieves these effects fully automatically, at the tap of the shutter button. Our approach first detects and segments the salient subject. We track the scene motion over multiple frames and align the images in order to preserve desired sharpness and to produce aesthetically pleasing motion streaks. We capture an under-exposed burst and select the subset of input frames that will produce blur trails of controlled length, regardless of scene or camera motion velocity. We predict inter-frame motion and synthesize motion-blur to fill the temporal gaps between the input frames. Finally, we composite the blurred image with the sharp regular exposure to protect the sharpness of faces or areas of the scene that are barely moving, and produce a final high resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Our system democratizes a capability previously reserved to professionals, and makes this creative style accessible to most casual photographers.},

In this article, we focus on Satisfiablity Modulo Integer Arithmetic, which is referred to as SMT(IA), including both linear and non-linear integer arithmetic theories. Dominant approaches to SMT rely on calling a CDCL-based SAT solver, either in a lazy or eager flavour. Local search, a competitive approach to solving combinatorial problems including SAT, however, has not been well studied for SMT. We develop the first local-search algorithm for SMT(IA) by directly operating on variables, breaking through the traditional framework. We propose a local-search framework by considering the distinctions between Boolean and integer variables. Moreover, we design a novel operator and scoring functions tailored for integer arithmetic, as well as a two-level operation selection heuristic. Putting these together, we develop a local search SMT(IA) solver called LocalSMT. Experiments are carried out to evaluate LocalSMT on benchmark sets from SMT-LIB. The results show that LocalSMT is competitive and complementary with state-of-the-art SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulae with only integer variables. A simple sequential portfolio with Z3 improves the state-of-the-art on satisfiable benchmark sets from SMT-LIB.},

However, FO cannot express the very simple algorithmic question whether two vertices are connected. We enrich FO with connectivity predicates that are tailored to express algorithmic graph problems that are commonly studied in parameterized algorithmics. By adding the atomic predicates connk(x,y,z_1,..., zk) that hold true in a graph if there exists a path between (the valuations of)xandyafter (the valuations of)z1,..., zkhave been deleted, we obtainseparator logicFO + conn. We show that separator logic can express many interesting problems, such as the feedback vertex set problem and elimination distance problems to first-order definable classes. Denote by FO + connkthe fragment of separator logic that is restricted to connectivity predicates with at mostk + 2variables (that is, at mostkdeletions), we show that FO + connk + 1is strictly more expressive than FO + connkfor allk ≥ 0. We then study the limitations of separator logic and prove that it cannot express planarity, and, in particular, not the disjoint paths problem. We obtain the strongerdisjoint-paths logicFO + DP by adding the atomic predicates disjoint-pathsk[(x1, y1),..., (xk, yk) that evaluate to true if there are internally vertex-disjoint paths between (the valuations of)xiandyifor all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Disjoint-paths logic can express the disjoint paths problem, the problem of (topological) minor containment, the problem of hitting (topological) minors, and many more. Again, we show that the fragments FO + DPkthat use predicates for at mostkdisjoint paths form a strict hierarchy of expressiveness. Finally, we compare the expressive power of the new logics with that of transitive-closure logics and monadic second-order logic.},

Moreover, it has been established that a human’s decision to rely on such systems is a function of both their trust in the system and their own self-confidence as it relates to executing the task of interest. Given that both under- and over-reliance on automation can pose significant risks to humans, there is motivation for developing autonomous systems that could appropriately calibrate a human’s trust or self-confidence to achieve proper reliance behavior. In this article, a computational model of coupled human trust and self-confidence dynamics is proposed. The dynamics are modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process without a reward function (POMDP/R) that leverages behavioral and self-report data as observations for estimation of these cognitive states. The model is trained and validated using data collected from 340 participants. Analysis of the transition probabilities shows that the proposed model captures the probabilistic relationship between trust, self-confidence, and reliance for all discrete combinations of high and low trust and self-confidence. The use of the proposed model to design an optimal policy to facilitate trust and self-confidence calibration is a goal of future work.},

Recently, various algorithm efforts have been committed to improving image reconstruction quality and speed. However, the inference of SR contains huge amounts of computation and data access, leading to low hardware implementation efficiency. For instance, the up-sampling with the deconvolution process requires considerable computation resources. In addition, the sizes of output feature maps of several middle layers are extraordinarily large, which is challenging to optimize, causing serious data access issues. In this work, we present an all-on-chip hardware architecture based on the deconvolution scheme and feature map segmentation strategy, namely ADAS, where all the generated data by the middle layers are buffered on-chip to avoid large data movements between on- and off-chip. In ADAS, we develop a hardware-friendly and efficient deconvolution scheme to accelerate the computation. Also, the dynamic reconfigurable process element (PE) combined with efficient mapping is proposed to enhance PE utilization up to nearly 100% and support multiple scaling factors. Based on our experimental results, ADAS demonstrates real-time image SR and better image reconstruction quality with PSNR (37.15

Further, we prove that adding a single constant makes the two variable fragment of 𝖳𝖬𝖫 undecidable. On the other hand, when equality is added to the logic, it loses the finite model property.},

  abstract = {In this article, we enrich McCarthy’s theory of extensional arrays with a length and a maxdiff operation. As is well-known, some diff operation (i.e., some kind of difference function showing where two unequal arrays differ) is needed to keep interpolants quantifier free in array theories. Our maxdiff operation returns the max index where two arrays differ; thus, it has a univocally determined semantics.
          The length function is a natural complement of such a maxdiff operation and is needed to handle real arrays. Obtaining interpolation results for such a rich theory is a surprisingly hard task. We get such results via a thorough semantic analysis of the models of the theory and of their amalgamation and strong amalgamation properties. The results are modular with respect to the index theory; we show how to convert them into concrete interpolation algorithms via a hierarchical approach realizing a polynomial reduction to interpolation in linear arithmetics endowed with free function symbols.},

  abstract = {With the implementation of China's reform and opening up and China's accession to the World Trade Organization, Chinese business Korean translation plays an increasingly important role in international trade activities. Although the study of business Korean has aroused the strong research interest of scholars, its research focus is limited to word selection, grammatical transformation and various specific translation techniques, which is far from systematic. Good business translation should also involve factors such as the translator's role, cross-culture, and the client of translation. However, how to combine corpus with language teaching, make corpus enter the classroom and get practical application in daily language teaching is still in the exploratory stage. Most of the existing translation theories are tailored for literary translation, and business translation is a branch of non-literary translation, so these theories are difficult to guide business translation. Combined with the research results of translation studies and examples in business Korean, this paper discusses the characteristics and translation of business Korean as a special Korean, so as to provide reference for translation or related learners, and also want to attract more scholars to pay attention to business Korean and its translation.},

  abstract = {Property testing algorithms are highly efficient algorithms that come with probabilistic accuracy guarantees. For a property
            P
            , the goal is to distinguish inputs that have
            P
            from those that are
            far
            from having
            P
            with high probability correctly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the input. In property testing on graphs, the
            distance
            is measured by the number of edge modifications (additions or deletions) that are necessary to transform a graph into one with property
            P
            . Much research has focused on the
            query complexity
            of such algorithms, i. e., the number of queries the algorithm makes to the input, but in view of applications, the
            running time
            of the algorithm is equally relevant.
          
          
            In (Adler, Harwath, STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree graph model of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was introduced, and it was shown that on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic second-order logic with counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and
            sublinear
            running time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running time.
          
          
            In this article we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree model, but the distance measure allows both edge (tuple) modifications and vertex (element) modifications. We show that every property that is testable in the classical model is testable in our model with the same query complexity and running time, but the converse is not true. Our main theorem shows that on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in CMSO is testable with constant query complexity and
            constant
            running time in the new model. Our proof methods include the semilinearity of the neighborhood histograms of databases having the property and a result by Alon (Proposition 19.10 in Lovász, Large networks and graph limits, 2012) that states that for every bounded degree graph
            
              \(\mathcal {G}\)
            
            there exists a constant size graph
            
              \(\mathcal {H}\)
            
            that has a similar neighborhood distribution to 
            
              \(\mathcal {G}\)
            
            .
          
          It can be derived from a result in (Benjamini et al., Advances in Mathematics 2010) that hyperfinite hereditary properties are testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in the classical model (and hence in the new model). Using our methods, we give an alternative proof that hyperfinite hereditary properties are testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in the new model.
          We argue that our model is natural and our meta-theorem showing constant-time CMSO testability supports this.},

  abstract = {Argumentation is a well-established formalism dealing with conflicting information by generating and comparing arguments. It has been playing a major role in AI for decades. In logic-based argumentation, we explore the internal structure of an argument. Informally, a set of formulas is the support for a given claim if it is consistent, subset-minimal, and implies the claim. In such a case, the pair of the support and the claim together is called an argument. In this article, we study the propositional variants of the following three computational tasks studied in argumentation: ARG (exists a support for a given claim with respect to a given set of formulas), ARG-Check (is a given set a support for a given claim), and ARG-Rel (similarly as ARG plus requiring an additionally given formula to be contained in the support). ARG-Check is complete for the complexity class DP, and the other two problems are known to be complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (Creignou et al. 2014 and Parson et al., 2003) and, accordingly, are highly intractable. Analyzing the reason for this intractability, we perform a two-dimensional classification: First, we consider all possible propositional fragments of the problem within Schaefer’s framework (STOC 1978) and then study different parameterizations for each of the fragments. We identify a list of reasonable structural parameters (size of the claim, support, knowledge base) that are connected to the aforementioned decision problems. Eventually, we thoroughly draw a fine border of parameterized intractability for each of the problems showing where the problems are fixed-parameter tractable and when this exactly stops. Surprisingly, several cases are of very high intractability (para-NP and beyond).},

The ten operators considered in this article are shown to be all reducible to three: lexicographic revision, refinement, and severe withdrawal. In turn, these three can be expressed in terms of lexicographic revision at the cost of restructuring the sequence. This restructuring needs not to be done explicitly: an algorithm that works on the original sequence is shown. The complexity of mixed sequences of belief change operators is also analyzed. Most of them require only a polynomial number of calls to a satisfiability checker, some are even easier.},

          As software refactoring is traditionally a critical tool for reducing technical debt, we sought to better understand the unique and growing ecology of computational notebooks by investigating the refactoring of public Jupyter notebooks. We randomly selected 15,000 Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub and studied 200 with meaningful commit histories. We found that notebook authors do refactor, favoring a few basic classic refactorings as well as those involving the notebook cell construct. Those with a computing background refactored differently than others, but not more so. Exploration-focused notebooks had a unique refactoring profile compared to more exposition-focused notebooks. Authors more often refactored their code as they went along, rather than deferring maintenance to big cleanups. These findings point to refactoring being intrinsic to notebook development.},

Our experimental results show a clear preference for the salient region to be centered in the image and that there is a preferred size of non-salient border around this salient region. We thus propose a novel image cropping mechanism for images containing a single salient region to achieve the best aesthetic balance.

  abstract = {Proofs in propositional logic are typically presented as trees of derived formulas or, alternatively, as directed acyclic graphs of derived formulas. This distinction between tree-like vs. dag-like structure is particularly relevant when making quantitative considerations regarding, for example, proof size. Here we analyze a more general type of structural restriction for proofs in rule-based proof systems. In this definition, proofs are directed graphs of derived formulas in which cycles are allowed as long as every formula is derived at least as many times as it is required as a premise. We call such proofs “circular”. We show that, for all sets of standard inference rules with single or multiple conclusions, circular proofs are sound. We start the study of the proof complexity of circular proofs at Circular Resolution, the circular version of Resolution. We immediately see that Circular Resolution is stronger than dag-like Resolution since, as we show, the propositional encoding of the pigeonhole principle has circular Resolution proofs of polynomial size. Furthermore, for derivations of clauses from clauses, we show that Circular Resolution is, surprisingly, equivalent to Sherali-Adams, a proof system for reasoning through polynomial inequalities that has linear programming at its base. As corollaries we get: (1) polynomial-time (LP-based) algorithms that find Circular Resolution proofs of constant width, (2) examples that separate Circular from dag-like Resolution, such as the pigeonhole principle and its variants, and (3) exponentially hard cases for Circular Resolution. Contrary to the case of Circular Resolution, for Frege we show that circular proofs can be converted into tree-like proofs with at most polynomial overhead.},

We consider arithmetical algebras with division as a partial operator, called meadows, and focus on algebras of rational numbers. To study eager equality, we use common meadows, which are totalisations of partial meadows by means of absorptive elements. An axiomatisation of common meadows is the basis of an axiomatisation of eager equality as a predicate on a common meadow. Applied to the rational numbers, we prove completeness and decidability of the equational theory of eager equality. To situate eager equality theoretically, we consider two other partial equalities of increasing strictness: Kleene equality, which is equivalent to the native equality of common meadows, and one we call cautious equality. Our methods of analysis for eager equality are quite general, and so we apply them to these two other partial equalities; and, in addition to common meadows, we use three other kinds of algebra designed to totalise division. In summary, we are able to compare 13 forms of equality for the partial meadow of rational numbers. We focus on the decidability of the equational theories of these equalities. We show that for the four total algebras, eager and cautious equality are decidable. We also show that for others the Diophantine Problem over the rationals is one-one computably reducible to their equational theories. The Diophantine Problem for rationals is a longstanding open problem. Thus, eager equality has substantially less complex semantics.},

Serial simulations and parallel weak and strong scaling on up to 147,456 CPU cores on 3,072 compute nodes are presented. The results obtained indicate that global-coarsening algorithms show a better parallel behavior for comparable smoothers due to the better load balance, particularly on the expensive fine levels. In the serial case, the costs of applying hanging-node constraints might be significant, leading to advantages of local smoothing, even though the number of solver iterations needed is slightly higher. When using

  abstract = {Although various dynamic or temporal logics have been proposed to verify quantum protocols and systems, these two viewpoints have not been studied comprehensively enough. We propose Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (LTQL), a linear temporal extension of quantum logic with a quantum implication, and extend it to Dynamic Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (DLTQL). This logic has temporal operators to express transitions by unitary operators (quantum gates) and dynamic ones to express those by projections (projective measurement). We then prove some logical properties of the relationship between these two transitions expressed by LTQL and DLTQL. A drawback in applying LTQL to the verification of quantum protocols is that these logics cannot express the future operator in linear temporal logic. We propose a way to mitigate this drawback by using a translation from (D)LTQL to Linear Temporal Modal Logic (LTML) and a simulation. This translation reduces the satisfiability problem of (D)LTQL formulas to that of LTML with the classical semantics over quantum states.},

Modern FPGA devices can leverage high-bandwidth memory technologies, but when applications are memory-bound designers must craft advanced communication and memory architectures for efficient data movement and on-chip storage. This development process requires hardware design skills that are uncommon in domain-specific experts. In this article, we propose an automated tool flow from a domain-specific language for tensor expressions to generate massively parallel accelerators on high-bandwidth-memory-equipped FPGAs. Designers can use this flow to integrate and evaluate various compiler or hardware optimizations. We use
            computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
            as a paradigmatic example. Our flow starts from the high-level specification of tensor operations and combines a multi-level intermediate representation–based compiler with an in-house hardware generation flow to generate systems with parallel accelerators and a specialized memory architecture that moves data efficiently, aiming at fully exploiting the available CPU-FPGA bandwidth. We simulated applications with millions of elements, achieving up to 103 GFLOPS with one compute unit and custom precision when targeting a Xilinx Alveo U280. Our FPGA implementation is up to 25× more energy efficient than expert-crafted Intel CPU implementations.},

  abstract = {Applying artificial intelligence to Chinese language translation in computational linguistics is of practical significance for economic boosts and cultural exchanges. In the present work, the bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is employed to extract Chinese text features regarding the overlapping semantic roles in Chinese language translation and hard-to-converge training of high-dimensional text word vectors in text classification during translation. In addition, AlexNet is optimized to extract the local features of the text and meanwhile update and learn network parameters in the deep network. Then, the attention mechanism is introduced to build a forecasting algorithm of Chinese language translation based on BiLSTM and improved AlexNet. Last, the forecasting algorithm is simulated to validate its performance. Some state-of-the-art algorithms are selected for a comparative experiment, including long short-term memory, regions with convolutional neural network features, AlexNet, and support vector machine. Results demonstrate that the forecasting algorithm proposed here can achieve a feature identification accuracy of 90.55%, at least an improvement of 4.24% over other algorithms. In addition, it provides an area under the curve of above 90%, a training duration of about 54.21 seconds, and a test duration of about 19.07 seconds. Regarding the performance of Chinese language translation, the algorithm proposed here provides a bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) value of 28.21 on the training set, with a performance gain ratio reaching 111.55%; on the test set, its BLEU reaches 40.45, with a performance gain ratio of 129.80%. Hence, this forecasting algorithm is notably superior to other algorithms, which can enhance the machine translation performance. Through experiments, the Chinese language translation algorithm constructed here improves translation performance while ensuring a high correct identification rate, providing experimental references for the later intelligent development of Chinese language translation in computational linguistics.},

We validate the GEO framework in experiments with real-world datasets and describe some resulting managerial implications for automotive facelift. Our study makes both methodological and application contributions. First, the generator’s mapping network and projection methods are carefully tailored to facelift where only minor changes are performed without affecting the family signature of the automobile brands. Second, two evaluation metrics are proposed to assess the generated designs. Third, profit maximisation is taken into account in the design selection. From a high-level perspective, our study contributes to the recent use of machine learning and data mining in marketing and design studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses deep generative models for automotive regional design upgrading and that provides an end-to-end decision-support solution for automakers and designers.},

In this article, we contribute to this effort by giving the first computational complexity analyses of problems associated with algorithm, environmental influence, and leader selection methods for the control of swarms performing distributed construction tasks. These analyses are done relative to a simple model in which swarms of deterministic finite-state robots operate in a synchronous error-free manner in 2D grid-based environments. We show that all three of our problems are polynomial-time intractable in general and remain intractable under a number of plausible restrictions (both individually and in many combinations) on robot controllers, environments, target structures, and sequences of swarm control commands. We also give the first restrictions relative to which these problems are tractable, as well as discussions of the implications of our results for both the design and deployment of swarm control assistance software tools and the human control of swarms.},

  abstract = {Hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) would overload database systems. To alleviate performance interference between transactions and analytics, recent research pursues the potential of in-storage processing (ISP) using commodity computational storage devices (CSDs). However, in-storage query processing faces technical challenges in HTAP environments. Continuously updated data versions pose two hurdles: (1) data items keep changing, and (2) finding visible data versions incurs excessive data access in CSDs. Such access patterns dominate the cost of query processing, which may hinder the active deployment of CSDs.
          
            This paper addresses the core issues by proposing an

            (AIDE) that transforms engine-specific query execution logic into vendor-neutral computation through a canonical interface. At the core of AIDE are the
            canonical representation
            of vendor-specific data and the separate management of data locators. It enables any CSD to execute vendor-neutral operations on canonical tuples with separate indexes, regardless of host databases. To eliminate excessive data access, we
            prescreen
            the indexes before offloading; thus, host-side prescreening can obviate the need for running costly version searching in CSDs and boost analytics. We implemented our prototype for PostgreSQL and MyRocks, demonstrating that AIDE supports efficient ISP for two databases using the same FPGA logic. Evaluation results show that AIDE improves query latency up to 42× on PostgreSQL and 34× on MyRocks.},

  abstract = {The existing testing theories for CSP cater for verification of interaction patterns (traces) and deadlocks, but not time. We address here refinement and testing based on a dialect of CSP, called
            tock
            -CSP, which can capture discrete time properties. This version of CSP has been of widespread interest for decades; recently, it has been given a denotational semantics, and model checking has become possible using a well established tool. Here, we first equip
            tock
            -CSP with a novel semantics for testing, which distinguishes input and output events: the standard models of (
            tock
            -)CSP do not differentiate them, but for testing this is essential. We then present a new testing theory for timewise refinement, based on novel definitions of test and test execution. Finally, we reconcile refinement and testing by relating timed ioco testing and refinement in
            tock
            -CSP with inputs and outputs. With these results, this paper provides, for the first time, a systematic theory that allows both timed testing and timed refinement to be expressed. An important practical consequence is that this ensures that the notion of correctness used by developers guarantees that tests pass when applied to a correct system and, in addition, faults identified during testing correspond to development mistakes.},

  abstract = {Parikh proposed his relevance-sensitive axiom to remedy the weakness of the classical AGM paradigm in addressing relevant change. An insufficiency of Parikh’s criterion, however, is its dependency on the contingent beliefs of a belief set to be revised, since the former only constrains the revision process of splittable theories (i.e., theories that can be divided in mutually disjoint compartments). The case of arbitrary non-splittable belief sets remains out of the scope of Parikh’s approach. On that premise, we generalize Parikh’s criterion, introducing (both axiomatically and semantically) a new notion of relevance, which we call
            relevance at the sentential level
            . We show that the proposed notion of relevance is universal (as it is applicable to arbitrary belief sets) and acts in a more refined way as compared to Parikh’s proposal; as we illustrate, this latter feature of relevance at the sentential level potentially leads to a significant drop in the computational resources required for implementing belief revision. Furthermore, we prove that Dalal’s popular revision operator respects, to a certain extent, relevance at the sentential level. Last but not least, the tight relation between local and relevance-sensitive revision is pointed out.},

  abstract = {In this article, we consider Answer Set Programming (ASP). It is a declarative problem solving paradigm that can be used to encode a problem as a logic program whose answer sets correspond to the solutions of the problem. It has been widely applied in various domains in AI and beyond. Given that answer sets are supposed to yield solutions to the original problem, the question of “why a set of atoms is an answer set” becomes important for both semantics understanding and program debugging. It has been well investigated for normal logic programs. However, for the class of disjunctive logic programs, which is a substantial extension of that of normal logic programs, this question has not been addressed much. In this article, we propose a notion of reduct for disjunctive logic programs and show how it can provide answers to the aforementioned question. First, we show that for each answer set, its reduct provides a resolution proof for each atom in it. We then further consider minimal sets of rules that will be sufficient to provide resolution proofs for sets of atoms. Such sets of rules will be called witnesses and are the focus of this article. We study complexity issues of computing various witnesses and provide algorithms for computing them. In particular, we show that the problem is tractable for normal and headcycle-free disjunctive logic programs, but intractable for general disjunctive logic programs. We also conducted some experiments and found that for many well-known ASP and SAT benchmarks, computing a minimal witness for an atom of an answer set is often feasible.},

            16
            ], but leaving open the most important case of QBF resolution. Different from the Frege case, our characterisation uses a new version of decision lists as its circuit model, which is stronger than the CNFs the system works with. Our decision list model is well suited to compute countermodels for QBFs. Our characterisation works for both
            Q-Resolution and QU-Resolution.
          
          
            Using our characterisation, we obtain a

            in the spirit of the celebrated result for propositional resolution [

            We demonstrate that

In doing this, we study the special forms of PGP, switchability, and collapsibility, in detail, both algebraically and logically, addressing various questions such as decidability on the way.
          
          
            We then prove a complexity-theoretic converse in the case of infinite constraint languages encoded in propositional logic, that if Inv}(𝔸) satisfies the exponentially generated powers property (EGP), then QCSP (Inv(𝔸)) is co-NP-hard. Since Zhuk proved that only PGP and EGP are possible, we derive a full dichotomy for the QCSP, justifying what we term the

            r

The significance of this is that, for QCSP on finite structures, it is still possible all QCSP tractability (in NP) explained by switchability is already explained by collapsibility. At least, no counterexample is known to this.}

  abstract = {Computational techniques offer a means to overcome the amplified complexity and resource-intensity of qualitative research on online communities. However, we lack an understanding of how these techniques are integrated by researchers in practice, and how to address concerns about researcher agency in the qualitative research process. To explore this gap, we deployed the Computational Thematic Analysis Toolkit to a team of public health researchers, and compared their analysis to a team working with traditional tools and methods. Each team independently conducted a thematic analysis of a corpus of comments from Canadian news sites to understand discourses around vaccine hesitancy. We then compared the analyses to investigate how computational techniques may have influenced their research process and outcomes. We found that the toolkit provided access to advanced computational techniques for researchers without programming expertise, facilitated their interaction and interpretation of the data, but also found that it influenced how they approached their thematic analysis.},

  abstract = {We consider a spectrum of geometric optimization problems motivated by contexts such as satellite communication and astrophysics. In the problem
            Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs
            , we are given a graph
            G
            that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of
            G
            need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. To scan their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a vertex incurs some cost in terms of energy or rotation time that is proportional to the corresponding rotation angle. Our goal is to compute schedules that minimize the following objective functions: (i) in
            Minimum Makespan Scan Cover
            (MSC-MS), this is the time until all edges are scanned; (ii) in
            Minimum Total Energy Scan Cover
            (MSC-TE), the sum of all rotation angles; and (iii) in
            Minimum Bottleneck Energy Scan Cover
            (MSC-BE), the maximum total rotation angle at one vertex.
          
          Previous theoretical work on MSC-MS revealed a close connection to graph coloring and the cut cover problem, leading to hardness and approximability results. In this article, we present polynomial-time algorithms for one-dimensional (1D) instances of MSC-TE and MSC-BE but NP-hardness proofs for bipartite 2D instances. For bipartite graphs in 2D, we also give 2-approximation algorithms for both MSC-TE and MSC-BE. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive study of practical methods for all three problems. We compare three different mixed-integer programming and two constraint programming approaches and show how to compute provably optimal solutions for geometric instances with up to 300 edges. Additionally, we compare the performance of different meta-heuristics for even larger instances.},

  abstract = {High-performance computing scientists are producing unprecedented volumes of data that take a long time to load for analysis. However, many analyses only require loading in the data containing particular features of interest and scientists have many approaches for identifying these features. Therefore, if scientists store information (descriptive metadata) about these identified features, then for subsequent analyses they can use this information to only read in the data containing these features. This can greatly reduce the amount of data that scientists have to read in, thereby accelerating analysis. Despite the potential benefits of descriptive metadata management, no prior work has created a descriptive metadata system that can help scientists working with a wide range of applications and analyses to restrict their reads to data containing features of interest. In this article, we present EMPRESS, the first such solution. EMPRESS offers all of the features needed to help accelerate discovery: It can accelerate analysis by up to 300 ×, supports a wide range of applications and analyses, is high-performing, is highly scalable, and requires minimal storage space. In addition, EMPRESS offers features required for a production-oriented system: scalable metadata consistency techniques, flexible system configurations, fault tolerance as a service, and portability.},

The intention behind developing AI was and is to benefit humans by reducing labor, increasing everyday conveniences, and promoting social good. However, recent research and AI applications indicate that AI can cause unintentional harm to humans by, for example, making unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios or undermining fairness by inadvertently discriminating against a group or groups. Consequently, trustworthy AI has recently garnered increased attention regarding the need to avoid the adverse effects that AI could bring to people, so people can fully trust and live in harmony with AI technologies.A tremendous amount of research on trustworthy AI has been conducted and witnessed in recent years. In this survey, we present a comprehensive appraisal of trustworthy AI from a computational perspective to help readers understand the latest technologies for achieving trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI is a large and complex subject, involving various dimensions. In this work, we focus on six of the most crucial dimensions in achieving trustworthy AI: (i) Safety &amp; Robustness, (ii) Nondiscrimination &amp; Fairness, (iii) Explainability, (iv) Privacy, (v) Accountability &amp; Auditability, and (vi) Environmental Well-being. For each dimension, we review the recent related technologies according to a taxonomy and summarize their applications in real-world systems. We also discuss the accordant and conflicting interactions among different dimensions and discuss potential aspects for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.},

While the pervasiveness of algorithmic bias has been widely acknowledged, and perceptions of fairness are commonly studied in Human Computer Interaction, there is a lack of research on how unfair treatment by automated computational systems is experienced by users from disadvantaged and marginalised backgrounds. There is a need for more diversification in terms of the investigated users, domains, and tasks, and regarding the strategies that users employ to reduce harm. To unpack these issues, we ran a prescreened survey of 663 participants, oversampling those with at-risk characteristics. We collected occurrences and types of conflicts regarding unfair and discriminatory treatment and systems, as well as the actions taken towards resolving these situations. Drawing on intersectional research, we combine qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to highlight the nuances around power and privilege in the perceptions of automated computational systems. Among our participants, we discuss experiences of computational essentialism, attribute-based exclusion, and expected harm. We derive suggestions to address these perceptions of unfairness as they occur.},

Motivated by quantum linear algebra algorithms and the quantum singular value transformation (SVT) framework of Gilyén et al. [STOC’19], we develop classical algorithms for SVT that run in time independent of input dimension, under suitable quantum-inspired sampling assumptions. Our results give compelling evidence that in the corresponding QRAM data structure input model, quantum SVT does not yield exponential quantum speedups. Since the quantum SVT framework generalizes essentially all known techniques for quantum linear algebra, our results, combined with sampling lemmas from previous work, suffice to generalize all prior results about dequantizing quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis. Our improvements come from identifying the key feature of the quantum-inspired input model that is at the core of all prior quantum-inspired results: ℓ

As a first step towards addressing this gap, this paper presents the results of two studies: a review of existing computational tools, and an online survey of esports' players' learning needs supplemented with qualitative interviews. Using Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model of Self-Regulated Learning as a lens, we identify patterns in the types of support offered by existing tools and players' support interests during different learning phases.

This characterisation naturally extends to Hoare logic and Owicki-Gries reasoning by lifting weakest liberal preconditions (defined over read/write events) to the level of programs. We study three memory models (SC, TSO, and RC11-RAR) as example instantiations of the axioms, then we demonstrate the applicability of our reasoning technique on a number of litmus tests.

            (i.e., those calculi that support general and modular proof-strategies for cut elimination) and at identifying classes of logics that can be captured in terms of these calculi. In this context, Wansing introduced the notion of
            proper display calculi
            as one possible design framework for proof calculi in which the analyticity desiderata are realized in a particularly transparent way. Recently, the theory of
            properly displayable
            logics (i.e., those logics that can be equivalently presented with some proper display calculus) has been developed in connection with generalized Sahlqvist theory (a.k.a. unified correspondence). Specifically, properly displayable logics have been syntactically characterized as those axiomatized by
            analytic inductive axioms
            , which can be equivalently and algorithmically transformed into analytic structural rules so the resulting proper display calculi enjoy a set of basic properties: soundness, completeness, conservativity, cut elimination, and the subformula property. In this context, the proof that the given calculus is
            complete
            w.r.t. the original logic is usually carried out
            syntactically
            , i.e., by showing that a (cut-free) derivation exists of each given axiom of the logic in the basic system to which the analytic structural rules algorithmically generated from the given axiom have been added. However, so far, this proof strategy for
            syntactic completeness
            has been implemented on a case-by-case base and not in general. In this article, we address this gap by proving syntactic completeness for properly displayable logics in any normal (distributive) lattice expansion signature. Specifically, we show that for every analytic inductive axiom a cut-free derivation can be effectively generated that has a specific shape, referred to as
            pre-normal form

  abstract = {We design a proof system for propositional classical logic that integrates two languages for Boolean functions: standard conjunction-disjunction-negation and binary decision trees. We give two reasons to do so. The first is proof-theoretical naturalness: The system consists of all and only the inference rules generated by the single, simple, linear scheme of the recently introduced subatomic logic. Thanks to this regularity, cuts are eliminated via a natural construction. The second reason is that the system generates efficient proofs. Indeed, we show that a certain class of tautologies due to Statman, which cannot have better than exponential cut-free proofs in the sequent calculus, have polynomial cut-free proofs in our system. We achieve this by using the same construction that we use for cut elimination. In summary, by expanding the language of propositional logic, we make its proof theory more regular and generate more proofs, some of which are very efficient.
          That design is made possible by considering atoms as superpositions of their truth values, which are connected by self-dual, non-commutative connectives. A proof can then be projected via each atom into two proofs, one for each truth value, without a need for cuts. Those projections are semantically natural and are at the heart of the constructions in this article. To accommodate self-dual non-commutativity, we compose proofs in deep inference.},

We then extend the Cenzer/Weber analysis to the intersection of multiple random closed sets, identifying the Bernoulli measures with respect to which the intersection of relatively random closed sets can be non-empty.

  abstract = {This article presents a family of computational storage drives (CSDs) and demonstrates their performance and power improvements due to in-storage processing (ISP) when running big data analytics applications. CSDs are an emerging class of solid state drives that are capable of running user code while minimizing data transfer time and energy. Applications that can benefit from in situ processing include distributed training, distributed inferencing, and databases. To achieve the full advantage of the proposed ISP architecture, we propose software solutions for workload balancing before and at runtime for training and inferencing applications. Other applications such as sharding-based databases can readily take advantage of our ISP structure without additional tooling. Experimental results on different capacity and form factors of CSDs show up to 3.1× speedup in processing while reducing the energy consumption and data transfer by up to 67% and 68%, respectively, compared to regular enterprise solid state drives.},

  abstract = {Now that within the humanities more and more data sources have been created, a new opportunity is within reach: the searching of patterns spanning across data sources from archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutes. These institutes adopt various digitization strategies based on differences in selection procedures. This results in heterogeneous data sources with a huge impact on the accessibility and interoperability of data within and between these distributed collections. We identify three interrelated challenges that researchers may encounter when querying such distributed data sources, namely
            query formulation
            ,
            source selection
            , and
            alignment of data sources
            . We present a multiagent architecture to overcome these challenges and discuss a prototype implementation of the architecture by developing and integrating various technologies. To measure and validate the performance of integrated technologies that meet these three interrelated challenges, we propose a methodology for setting up and conducting experiments. We take an existing data source for which we can establish a baseline query result, against which we measure the precision and recall performance, and create various sets of data sources with realistic characteristics. We report on the results of a number of experiments that show the performance of the developed and integrated technologies.},

Set in a networked environment of increasing computing power, this “more than human” system derives from the latest computing advances fromNLP (natural language processing)and image recognition to artificial neural networks.

  abstract = {This investigation focuses on the application of computational intelligence to the security of Digital Twins (DTs) graphic data of the Cyber-physical System (CPS). The intricate and diverse physical space of CPS in the smart city is mapped in virtual space to construct the DTs CPS in the smart city. Besides, Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph-Big Multigraph (DPFS-BM) is employed to ensure data privacy security. Moreover, the analysis and prediction model for the DTs big graphic data (BGD) in the CPS is built based on Differential Privacy-AlexNet (DP-AlexNet). Alexnet successfully solves the gradient dispersion problem of the Sigmoid function of deep network structures. Finally, the comparative analysis approach is utilized to verify the performance of the model reported here by comparing it with Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, original AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron in a simulation experiment. Through the comparison in the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error, training time, and test time, the model proposed here outperforms other models regarding errors, time delay, and time consumption. In the same environment, the system performs better with multi-hop paths, extra relays, and a high fading index; in that case, the outage probability is minimal. Therefore, the DP-AlexNet model is suitable for processing BGD. Moreover, its speed acceleration is more apparent than that of other models, with a higher SpeedUp indicator. The research effectively combines data mining and data security, which is of significant value for optimizing the privacy protection technology of frequent subgraph mining on a single multi-graph. Besides, the constructed DTs of CPS can provide excellent accuracy and a prominent acceleration effect on the premise of low errors. In addition, the model reported here can provide reference for the intelligent and digital development of smart cities.},

  abstract = {In the mirror cup and saucer art created by artists Yul Cho and Sang-Ha Cho, part of the saucer is directly visible to the viewer, while the other part of the saucer is occluded and can only be seen as a reflection through a mirror cup. Thus, viewers see an image directly on the saucer and another image on the mirror cup; however, the existing art design is limited to wavelike saucers. In this work, we propose a general computational framework for mirror cup and saucer art design. As input, we take from the user one image for the direct view, one image for the reflected view, and the base shape of the saucer. Our algorithm then generates a suitable saucer shape by deforming the input shape. We formulate this problem as a constrained optimization for the saucer surface. Our framework solves for the fine geometry details on the base shape along with its texture, such that when a mirror cup is placed on the saucer, the user-specified images are observed as direct and reflected views. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the great design flexibility that it offers to users. We further validate the produced art pieces by fabricating the colored saucers using three-dimensional printing.},

  abstract = {With chip manufacturers such as Intel, IBM, and ARM offering native support for transactional memory in their instruction set architectures, memory transactions are on the verge of being considered a genuine application tool rather than just an interesting research topic. Despite this recent increase in popularity on the
            hardware side of transactional memory (HTM)
            ,
            software support for transactional memory (STM)
            is still scarce and the only compiler with transactional support currently available, the
            GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
            , does not generate code that achieves desirable performance. For
            hybrid solutions of TM (HyTM)
            , which are frameworks that leverage the best aspects of HTM and STM, the subpar performance of the software side, caused by inefficient compiler generated code, might forbid HyTM to offer optimal results. This article extends previous work focused exclusively on STM implementations by presenting a detailed analysis of transactional code generated by GCC in the context of HybridTM implementations. In particular, it builds on previous research of transactional memory support in the Clang/LLVM compiler framework, which is decoupled from any TM runtime, and presents the following novel contributions: (a) it shows that STM’s performance overhead, due to an excessive amount of read and write barriers added by the compiler, also impacts the performance of HyTM systems; and (b) it reveals the importance of the previously proposed annotation mechanism to reduce the performance gap between HTM and STM in phased runtime systems. Furthermore, it shows that, by correctly using the annotations on just a few lines of code, it is possible to reduce the total number of instrumented barriers by 95% and to achieve speed-ups of up to 7× when compared to the original code generated by GCC and the Clang compiler.

  abstract = {This work proposes a novel generative design tool for passive grippers---robot end effectors that have no additional actuation and instead leverage the existing degrees of freedom in a robotic arm to perform grasping tasks. Passive grippers are used because they offer interesting trade-offs between cost and capabilities. However, existing designs are limited in the types of shapes that can be grasped. This work proposes to use rapid-manufacturing and design optimization to expand the space of shapes that can be passively grasped. Our novel generative design algorithm takes in an object and its positioning with respect to a robotic arm and generates a 3D printable passive gripper that can stably pick the object up. To achieve this, we address the key challenge of jointly optimizing the shape and the insert trajectory to ensure a passively stable grasp. We evaluate our method on a testing suite of 22 objects (23 experiments), all of which were evaluated with physical experiments to bridge the virtual-to-real gap.

            High-level-of-difficulty
            , or simply
            high-level
            , interlocking puzzles are a subclass of interlocking puzzles that require multiple moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. Solving a high-level interlocking puzzle is a challenging task since one has to explore many different configurations of the puzzle pieces until reaching a configuration where the first subassembly can be taken out. Designing a high-level interlocking puzzle with a user-specified level of difficulty is even harder since the puzzle pieces have to be interlocking in all the configurations before the first subassembly is taken out.
          
          
            In this paper, we present a computational approach to design high-level interlocking puzzles. The core idea is to represent all possible configurations of an interlocking puzzle as well as transitions among these configurations using a rooted, undirected graph called a
            disassembly graph
            and leverage this graph to find a disassembly plan that requires a minimal number of moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. At the design stage, our algorithm iteratively constructs the geometry of each puzzle piece to expand the disassembly graph incrementally, aiming to achieve a user-specified level of difficulty. We show that our approach allows efficient generation of high-level interlocking puzzles of various shape complexities, including new solutions not attainable by state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for computing a sewing pattern of a given 3D garment model. Our algorithm segments an input 3D garment shape into patches and computes their 2D parameterization, resulting in pattern pieces that can be cut out of fabric and sewn together to manufacture the garment. Unlike the general state-of-the-art approaches for surface cutting and flattening, our method explicitly targets garment fabrication. It accounts for the unique properties and constraints of tailoring, such as seam symmetry, the usage of darts, fabric grain alignment, and a flattening distortion measure that models woven fabric deformation, respecting its anisotropic behavior. We bootstrap a recent patch layout approach developed for quadrilateral remeshing and adapt it to the purpose of computational pattern making, ensuring that the deformation of each pattern piece stays within prescribed bounds of cloth stress. While our algorithm can automatically produce the sewing patterns, it is fast enough to admit user input to creatively iterate on the pattern design. Our method can take several target poses of the 3D garment into account and integrate them into the sewing pattern design. We demonstrate results on both skintight and loose garments, showcasing the versatile application possibilities of our approach.},

Firstly, in this paper we show that Near-Data Processing (NDP) naturally fits in the HTAP design space. Secondly, we propose an NDP database architecture, allowing transactionally consistent in-situ executions of analytical operations in HTAP settings. We evaluate the proposed architecture in state-of-the-art key/value-stores and multi-versioned DBMS.

  abstract = {We describe a general and safe computational framework that provides integer programming results with the degree of certainty that is required for machine-assisted proofs of mathematical theorems. At its core, the framework relies on a rational branch-and-bound certificate produced by an exact integer programming solver, SCIP, in order to circumvent floating-point round-off errors present in most state-of-the-art solvers for mixed-integer programs. The resulting certificates are self-contained and checker software exists that can verify their correctness independently of the integer programming solver used to produce the certificate. This acts as a safeguard against programming errors that may be present in complex solver software. The viability of this approach is tested by applying it to finite cases of Chvátal’s conjecture, a long-standing open question in extremal combinatorics. We take particular care to verify also the correctness of the input for this specific problem, using the Coq formal proof assistant. As a result, we are able to provide the first machine-assisted proof that Chvátal’s conjecture holds for all downsets whose union of sets contains seven elements or less.},

We detail the C-SRAM system design on different levels: (i) circuit design and silicon proof of concept, (ii) system interface and instruction set architecture, and (iii) high-level software programming and simulation. Experimental results on two complete memory-bound applications, AES and MobileNetV2, show that the C-SRAM implementation achieves up to 70× timing speedup and 37× energy reduction compared to scalar architecture, and up to 17× timing speedup and 5× energy reduction compared to SIMD architecture.},

In this paper, we propose a CSP-like distributed programming language to facilitate the specification and verification of such systems. After presenting its operational and denotational semantics, we develop a Hoare-style logic for distributed quantum programs and establish its soundness and (relative) completeness with respect to both partial and total correctness. The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated by its applications in the verification of quantum teleportation and local implementation of non-local CNOT gates, two important algorithms widely used in distributed quantum systems.},

          We show that this issue is only apparent: the distinction between stuck and diverging computations is implicit in any big-step semantics and it just needs to be uncovered. To achieve this goal, we develop a systematic study of big-step semantics: we introduce an abstract definition of what a big-step semantics is, we define a notion of computation by formalizing the evaluation algorithm implicitly associated with any big-step semantics, and we show how to canonically extend a big-step semantics to characterize stuck and diverging computations.
          Building on these notions, we describe a general proof technique to show that a predicate is sound, that is, it prevents stuck computation, with respect to a big-step semantics. One needs to check three properties relating the predicate and the semantics, and if they hold, the predicate is sound. The extended semantics is essential to establish this meta-logical result but is of no concerns to the user, who only needs to prove the three properties of the initial big-step semantics. Finally, we illustrate the technique by several examples, showing that it is applicable also in cases where subject reduction does not hold, and hence the standard technique for small-step semantics cannot be used.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread adoption of computational notebooks, little is known about best practices for their usage in collaborative contexts. In this paper, we fill this gap by eliciting a catalog of best practices for collaborative data science with computational notebooks. With this aim, we first look for best practices through a multivocal literature review. Then, we conduct interviews with professional data scientists to assess their awareness of these best practices. Finally, we assess the adoption of best practices through the analysis of 1,380 Jupyter notebooks retrieved from the Kaggle platform. Findings reveal that experts are mostly aware of the best practices and tend to adopt them in their daily work. Nonetheless, they do not consistently follow all the recommendations as, depending on specific contexts, some are deemed unfeasible or counterproductive due to the lack of proper tool support. As such, we envision the design of notebook solutions that allow data scientists not to have to prioritize exploration and rapid prototyping over writing code of quality.},

  abstract = {Co-creative proccesses between people can be characterized by rich dialogue that carries each person's ideas into the collaborative space. When people co-create an artifact that is both technical and aesthetic, their dialogue reflects the interplay between these two dimensions. However, the dialogue mechanisms that express this interplay and the extent to which they are related to outcomes, such as peer satisfaction, are not well understood. This paper reports on a study of 68 high school learner dyads' textual dialogues as they create music by writing code together in a digital learning environment for musical remixing. We report on a novel dialogue taxonomy built to capture the technical and aesthetic dimensions of learners' collaborative dialogues. We identified dialogue act n-grams (sequences of length 1, 2, or 3) that are present within the corpus and discovered five significant n-gram predictors for whether a learner felt satisfied with their partner during the collaboration. The learner was more likely to report higher satisfaction with their partner when the learner frequently acknowledges their partner, exchanges positive feedback with their partner, and their partner proposes an idea and elaborates on the idea. In contrast, the learner is more likely to report lower satisfaction with their partner when the learner frequently accepts back-to-back proposals from their partner and when the partner responds to the learner's statements with positive feedback. This work advances understanding of collaborative dialogue within co-creative domains and suggests dialogue strategies that may be helpful to foster co-creativity as learners collaborate to produce a creative artifact. The findings also suggest important areas of focus for intelligent or adaptive systems that aim to support learners during the co-creative process.},

Due to the dynamics associated with the environment and parameter uncertainty, designing an optimal task offloading algorithm is highly challenging. Consequently, we propose an online task offloading algorithm based on a state-of-the-art
            deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
            technique:
            asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C)

            channel state information (CSI)

  abstract = {Experimental results are often plotted as 2-dimensional graphical plots (aka graphs) in scientific domains depicting dependent versus independent variables to aid visual analysis of processes. Repeatedly performing laboratory experiments consumes significant time and resources, motivating the need for computational estimation. The goals are to estimate the graph obtained in an experiment given its input conditions, and to estimate the conditions that would lead to a desired graph. Existing estimation approaches often do not meet accuracy and efficiency needs of targeted applications. We develop a computational estimation approach called AutoDomainMine that integrates clustering and classification over complex scientific data in a framework so as to automate classical learning methods of scientists. Knowledge discovered thereby from a database of existing experiments serves as the basis for estimation. Challenges include preserving domain semantics in clustering, finding matching strategies in classification, striking a good balance between elaboration and conciseness while displaying estimation results based on needs of targeted users, and deriving objective measures to capture subjective user interests. These and other challenges are addressed in this work. The AutoDomainMine approach is used to build a computational estimation system, rigorously evaluated with real data in Materials Science. Our evaluation confirms that AutoDomainMine provides desired accuracy and efficiency in computational estimation. It is extendable to other science and engineering domains as proved by adaptation of its sub-processes within fields such as Bioinformatics and Nanotechnology.},

            A

For large-scale problems, the direct application of a QR solver either fails because of insufficient memory or is unacceptably slow. We study several solution approaches based on using a sparse QR solver without modification, focussing on the case that the sparse part of
            A
            is rank deficient. We discuss partial matrix stretching and regularization and propose extending the augmented system formulation with iterative refinement for sparse problems to sparse-dense problems, optionally incorporating multi-precision arithmetic. In summary, our computational study shows that, before applying a black-box QR factorization, a check should be made for rows that are classified as dense and, if such rows are identified, then
            A
            should be split into sparse and dense blocks; a number of ways to use a black-box QR factorization to exploit this splitting are possible, with no single method found to be the best in all cases.},

Additional to epistemic modalities the logic contains dynamic modalities for making announcements and for receiving them. What an agent believes is a function of her initial uncertainty and of the announcements she has received. Beliefs need not be truthful, because announcements already made may not yet have been received. As announcements are true when sent, certain message sequences can be ruled out, just like inconsistent cuts in distributed computing.

To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n= 22) CT articulation was examined usinga prioricodes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

To overcome these challenges, we developed the Computational Thematic Analysis Toolkit, a modular software package that supports analysis of online communities by combining aspects of reflexive thematic analysis with computational techniques. Our toolkit demonstrates how common analysis tasks like data collection, cleaning and filtering, modelling and sampling, and coding can be implemented within a single visual interface, and how that interface can encourage researchers to manage ethical and transparency considerations throughout their research process.},

  abstract = {Team semantics is the mathematical basis of modern logics of dependence and independence. In contrast to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated not for a single assignment of values to the free variables, but on a set of such assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for a purely logical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence of data matters, but being based on sets, it does not take into account multiple occurrences of data values. It is therefore insufficient in scenarios where such multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning about probabilities and statistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams (i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors.
          In this paper we aim at a systematic development of logics of dependence and independence based on multiteam semantics. We study atomic dependency properties of finite multiteams and discuss the appropriate meaning of logical operators to extend the atomic dependencies to full-fledged logics for reasoning about dependence properties in a multiteam setting. We explore properties and expressive power of a wide spectrum of different multiteam logics and compare them to second-order logic and to logics with team semantics. In many cases the results resemble what is known in team semantics, but there are also interesting differences. While in team semantics, the combination of inclusion and exclusion dependencies leads to a logic with the full power of both independence logic and existential second-order logic, independence properties of multiteams are not definable by any combination of properties that are downwards closed or union closed and thus are strictly more powerful than inclusion-exclusion logic. We also study the relationship of logics with multiteam semantics with existential second-order logic for a specific class of metafinite structures. It turns out that inclusion-exclusion logic can be characterised in a precise sense by the Presburger fragment of this logic, but for capturing independence, we need to go beyond it and add some form of multiplication. Finally, we also consider multiteams with weights in the reals and study the expressive power of formulae by means of topological properties.},

  abstract = {Termination analysis of linear loops plays a key rôle in several areas of computer science, including program verification and abstract interpretation. Already for the simplest variants of linear loops the question of termination relates to deep open problems in number theory, such as the decidability of the Skolem and Positivity Problems for linear recurrence sequences, or equivalently reachability questions for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. In this article, we introduce the class of
            o-minimal invariants
            , which is broader than any previously considered, and study the decidability of the existence and algorithmic synthesis of such invariants as certificates of non-termination for linear loops equipped with a large class of halting conditions. We establish two main decidability results, one of them conditional on Schanuel’s conjecture is transcendental number theory.},

In this article, we present and study the logic rLTL, which provides a means to formally reason about both correctness and robustness in system design. Furthermore, we identify a large fragment of rLTL for which the verification problem can be efficiently solved, i.e., verification can be done by using an automaton, recognizing the behaviors described by the rLTL formula φ, of size at most O(3 |φ |), where |φ | is the length of φ. This result improves upon the previously known bound of O(5|φ |) for rLTL verification and is closer to the LTL bound of O(2|φ |). The usefulness of this fragment is demonstrated by a number of case studies showing its practical significance in terms of expressiveness, the ability to describe robustness, and the fine-grained information that rLTL brings to the process of system verification. Moreover, these advantages come at a low computational overhead with respect to LTL verification.},

Examples are Presburger modal logic, which extends graded modal logic with linear inequalities over numbers of successors, and probabilistic modal logic with polynomial inequalities over probabilities. We establish the theoretical upper bound using a type elimination algorithm. We also provide a global caching algorithm that potentially avoids building the entire exponential-sized space of candidate states, and thus offers a basis for practical reasoning. This algorithm still involves frequent fixpoint computations; we show how these can be handled efficiently in a concrete algorithm modelled on Liu and Smolka’s linear-time fixpoint algorithm. Finally, we show that the upper complexity bound is preserved under adding nominals to the logic, i.e., in coalgebraic hybrid logic.},

We also show some fundamental properties of the calculus such as confluence, strong normalization, preservation of β-strong normalization and the existence of a strong bisimulation that captures pairs of pn-terms having the same graph reduction.},

Automatic speech recognition and natural language processing create unique possibilities for analysis of oral history (OH) interviews, where otherwise the transcription and analysis of the full recording would be too time consuming. However, many oral historians note the loss of aural information when converting the speech into text, pointing out the relevance of subjective cues for a full understanding of the interviewee narrative. In this article, we explore various computational technologies for social signal processing and their potential application space in OH archives, as well as neighboring domains where qualitative studies is a frequently used method. We also highlight the latest developments in key technologies for multimedia archiving practices such as natural language processing and automatic speech recognition. We discuss the analysis of both visual (body language and facial expressions), and non-visual cues (paralinguistics, breathing, and heart rate), stating the specific challenges introduced by the characteristics of OH collections. We argue that applying social signal processing to OH archives will have a wider influence than solely OH practices, bringing benefits for various fields from humanities to computer sciences, as well as to archival sciences. Looking at human emotions and somatic reactions on extensive interview collections would give scholars from multiple fields the opportunity to focus on feelings, mood, culture, and subjective experiences expressed in these interviews on a larger scale.},

In this article, we study the potential of using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays in High-Performance Computing because of the rapid advances in reconfigurable hardware, such as the increase in on-chip memory size, increasing number of logic cells, and the integration of High-Bandwidth Memories on board.

Our interactive design tool is novel in that it allows direct control of key knitting design axes we have identified in our formative study and does so consistently across the variations of an input parametric template geometry. This is achieved with two key technical advances. First, we present an interactive meshing tool that lets users build a coarse quadrilateral mesh that adheres to their knit design guidelines. This solution ensures consistency across the parameter space for further customization over shape variations and avoids helices, promoting knittability. Second, we lift and formalize low-level machine knitting constraints to the level of this coarse quad mesh. This enables us to not only guarantee hand- and machine-knittability, but also provides automatic design assistance through auto-completion and suggestions. We show the capabilities through a set of fabricated examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in creating a wide variety of objects and interactively exploring the space of design variations.},

On the other hand, a nice workspace is essential to facilitate teamwork. In this way, workspace design and workplan design complement each other. Inspired by such observations, we propose an automatic approach to jointly design a workspace and a workplan. Taking staff properties, a space, and work equipment as input, our approach jointly optimizes a workspace and a workplan, considering performance factors such as time efficiency and congestion avoidance, as well as workload factors such as walk effort, turn effort, and workload balances. To enable exploration of design trade-offs, our approach generates a set of Pareto-optimal design solutions with strengths on different objectives, which can be adopted for different work scenarios. We apply our approach to synthesize workspaces and workplans for different workplaces such as a fast food kitchen and a supermarket. We also extend our approach to incorporate other common work considerations such as dynamic work demands and accommodating staff members with different physical capabilities. Evaluation experiments with simulations validate the efficacy of our approach for synthesizing effective workspaces and workplans.},

  abstract = {As a critical task in intelligent traffic systems, traffic prediction has received a large amount of attention in the past few decades. The early efforts mainly model traffic prediction as the time-series mining problem, in which the spatial dependence has been largely ignored. As the rapid development of deep learning, some attempts have been made in modeling traffic prediction as the spatio-temporal data mining problem in a road network, in which deep learning techniques can be adopted for modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously. Despite the success, the spatial and temporal dependencies are only modeled in a regionless network without considering the underlying hierarchical regional structure of the spatial nodes, which is an important structure naturally existing in the real-world road network. Apart from the challenge of modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies like the existing studies, the extra challenge caused by considering the hierarchical regional structure of the road network lies in simultaneously modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies between nodes and regions and the spatial and temporal dependencies between regions. To this end, this article proposes a new Temporal Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (TH-GAT). The main idea lies in augmenting the original road network into a region-augmented network, in which the hierarchical regional structure can be modeled. Based on the region-augmented network, the region-aware spatial dependence model and the region-aware temporal dependence model can be constructed, which are two main components of the proposed TH-GAT model. In addition, in the region-aware spatial dependence model, the graph attention network is adopted, in which the importance of a node to another node, of a node to a region, of a region to a node, and of a region to another region, can be captured automatically by means of the attention coefficients. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic datasets, and the results have confirmed the superiority of the proposed TH-GAT model.},

Many natural optimisation problems, however, cannot be formulated as VCSPs over a finite domain. We initiate the systematic investigation of the complexity of infinite-domain VCSPs with piecewise linear homogeneous cost functions. Such VCSPs can be solved in polynomial time if the cost functions are improved by fully symmetric fractional operations of all arities. We show this by reducing the problem to a finite-domain VCSP which can be solved using the basic linear program relaxation. It follows that VCSPs for submodular PLH cost functions can be solved in polynomial time; in fact, we show that submodular PLH functions form a maximally tractable class of PLH cost functions.},

We give a circuit characterization for FPR in terms of families of symmetric circuits with rank gates, along the lines of that for FPC given by Anderson and Dawar in 2017. This requires the development of a broad framework of circuits in which the individual gates compute functions that are not symmetric (i.e., invariant under all permutations of their inputs).

              q

To show decidability and a doubly exponential upper bound of the universal variant, we rely on results from algorithmic number theory and the possibility to compare local zeta functions associated to given polynomials. We then devise a general way to draw links between the universal probabilistic problems and widely studied problems on linear recurrence sequences. Finally, we study several variants of the equivalence problem, including a problem we call majority, motivated by differential privacy. We also define and provide some insights about program indistinguishability, proving that it is decidable for programs always returning 0 or 1.},

However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge.

  abstract = {Civic problems are often too complex to solve through traditional top-down strategies. Various governments and civic initiatives have explored more community-driven strategies where citizens get involved with defining problems and innovating solutions. While certain people may feel more empowered, the public at large often does not have accessible, flexible, and meaningful ways to engage. Prior theoretical frameworks for public participation typically offer a one-size-fits-all model based on face-to-face engagement and fail to recognize the barriers faced by even the most engaged citizens. In this article, we explore a vision for
            open civic design
            where we integrate theoretical frameworks from public engagement, crowdsourcing, and design thinking to consider the role technology can play in lowering barriers to large-scale participation, scaffolding problem-solving activities, and providing flexible options that cater to individuals’ skills, availability, and interests. We describe our novel theoretical framework and analyze the key goals associated with this vision: (1) to promote inclusive and sustained participation in civics; (2) to facilitate effective management of large-scale participation; and (3) to provide a structured process for achieving effective solutions. We present case studies of existing civic design initiatives and discuss challenges, limitations, and future work related to operationalizing, implementing, and testing this framework.},

To clarify the design parameters for intentionally suppressing change detection with morphing visuals, we investigated the visual change detection in three temporal behaviors: visual blank, eye-blink, and step-sequential changes. The results showed a robust trend of change blindness with a blank of more than 33.3 ms and with eye blink. Our sequential change study revealed that participants did not recognize changes until an average of 57% morphing toward another face in small change steps. In addition, changes went unnoticed until the end of morphing in more than 10% of all trials. Our findings should contribute to the design of covert visual updates without consuming users’ attention by leveraging change blindness with computational visual morphing.},

This calculus belongs to the\lambda \deltafamily of formal systems, which borrow some features from the pure type systems and some from the languages of the Automath tradition, but stand outside both families.

  abstract = {People are becoming increasingly more connected to each other as social networks continue to grow both in number and variety, and this is true for autonomous software agents as well. Taking them as a collection, such social platforms can be seen as one complex network with many different types of relations, different degrees of strength for each relation, and a wide range of information on each node. In this context, social media posts made by users are reflections of the content of their own individual (or local) knowledge bases; modeling how knowledge flows over the network—or how this can possibly occur—is therefore of great interest from a knowledge representation and reasoning perspective. In this article, we provide a formal introduction to the
            network knowledge base
            model, and then focus on the problem of how a single agent’s knowledge base changes when exposed to a stream of news items coming from other members of the network. We do so by taking the classical belief revision approach of first proposing desirable properties for how such a local operation should be carried out (theoretical characterization), arriving at three different families of local operators, exploring concrete algorithms (algorithmic characterization) for two of the families, and proving properties about the relationship between the two characterizations (representation theorem). One of the most important differences between our approach and the classical models of belief revision is that in our case the input is more complex, containing additional information about each piece of information.},

This review gives a detailed analysis of existing modeling techniques, model conceptualization and formulation, and the policy interventions they suggest. It also explores the data sources they used and the study population they represented.

In the current work, we explore synchrony in three-person teams using immersive virtual reality. Participants spent about two hours collaborating on four separate design tasks. The tracking data from the VR system allowed precise measurement of head and hand movements, facilitating calculation of synchrony. Results replicated previous work that found nonverbal synchrony in dyads in immersive VR. Moreover, we manipulated the context of the task environment, an informal garage or a traditional conference room. The environment for the task influenced synchrony, with higher levels occurring in the conference room than the garage. We also explored different methods of extending synchrony from dyads to triads, and explore the relationship of synchrony to turn taking and gaze. This paper provides theoretical insights about nonverbal synchrony and how design work functions in triads and provides suggestions for designers of VR to support good collaboration.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

We conducted ethnographic field work with small farmers and their community in Indiana and show how they are challenging "agrilogistics," defined by philosopher Timothy Morton as a strict separation of nature and culture in food production, a separation, he argues, which underlies the substantial agricultural contributions to climate change. Our ethnography led us to suggest new possibilities for design of agricultural technology that support ecological thinking and caring for more-than-human actors through visceral imaginaries, posthuman storytelling, and engaging curiosity, possibilities which may offer ways to disentangle agricultural technology from agrilogistic paradigms.?},

Given a sequence of desired stable states and the corresponding poses of the structure, we identify the topology and geometric realization of a mechanism—consisting of bars and joints—that is able to physically reproduce the desired multistable behavior. In order to solve this problem efficiently, we build on insights from minimally rigid graph theory to identify simple but effective topologies for the mechanism. We then optimize its geometric parameters, such as joint positions and bar lengths, to obtain correct transitions between the given poses. Simultaneously, we ensure adequate stability of each pose based on an effective approximate error metric related to the elastic energy Hessian of the bars in the mechanism. As demonstrated by our results, we obtain functional multistable mechanisms of manageable complexity that can be fabricated using 3D printing. Further, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method on a large number of examples in the simulation and fabricated several physical prototypes.},

In this article, we propose a promising alternative to overcome scalability limitations, based on a network of in-memory SNN accelerators, which can reduce the energy consumption by up to 150.25= when compared to a representative ASIC solution. The significant reduction in energy comes from two key aspects of the hardware design to minimize data communication overheads: (1) each node represents an in-memory SNN accelerator based on a spintronic Computational RAM array, and (2) a novel, De Bruijn graph based architecture establishes the SNN array connectivity.},

  abstract = {The traditional workflow in continuum mechanics simulations is that a geometry description —for example obtained using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) or Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools—forms the input for a mesh generator. The mesh is then used as the sole input for the finite element, finite volume, and finite difference solver, which at this point no longer has access to the original, “underlying” geometry. However, many modern techniques—for example, adaptive mesh refinement and the use of higher order geometry approximation methods—really do need information about the underlying geometry to realize their full potential. We have undertaken an exhaustive study of where typical finite element codes use geometry information, with the goal of determining what information geometry tools would have to provide. Our study shows that nearly all geometry-related needs inside the simulators can be satisfied by just two “primitives”: elementary queries posed by the simulation software to the geometry description. We then show that it is possible to provide these primitives in all of the frequently used ways in which geometries are described in common industrial workflows, and illustrate our solutions using a number of examples.},

  abstract = {Wrapping objects using ropes is a common practice in our daily life. However, it is difficult to design and tie ropes on a 3D object with complex topology and geometry features while ensuring wrapping security and easy operation. In this article, we propose to compute a rope net that can tightly wrap around various 3D shapes. Our computed rope net not only immobilizes the object but also maintains the load balance during lifting. Based on the key observation that if every knot of the net has four adjacent curve edges, then only a single rope is needed to construct the entire net. We reformulate the rope net computation problem into a constrained curve network optimization. We propose a discrete-continuous optimization approach, where the topological constraints are satisfied in the discrete phase and the geometrical goals are achieved in the continuous stage. We also develop a hoist planning to pick anchor points so that the rope net equally distributes the load during hoisting. Furthermore, we simulate the wrapping process and use it to guide the physical rope net construction process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D objects with varying geometric and topological complexity. In addition, we conduct physical experiments to demonstrate the practicability of our method.},

  abstract = {We study the complexity of various fundamental counting problems that arise in the context of incomplete databases, i.e., relational databases that can contain unknown values in the form of labeled nulls. Specifically, we assume that the domains of these unknown values are finite and, for a Boolean query 
            q
            , we consider the following two problems: Given as input an incomplete database 
            D
            , (a) return the number of completions of 
            D
            that satisfy 
            q
            ; or (b) return the number of valuations of the nulls of 
            D
            yielding a completion that satisfies 
            q
            . We obtain dichotomies between #P-hardness and polynomial-time computability for these problems when 
            q
            is a self-join–free conjunctive query and study the impact on the complexity of the following two restrictions: (1) every null occurs at most once in 
            D
            (what is called
            Codd tables
            ); and (2) the domain of each null is the same. Roughly speaking, we show that counting completions is much harder than counting valuations: For instance, while the latter is always in #P, we prove that the former is not in #P under some widely believed theoretical complexity assumption. Moreover, we find that both (1) and (2) can reduce the complexity of our problems. We also study the approximability of these problems and show that, while counting valuations always has a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), in most cases counting completions does not. Finally, we consider more expressive query languages and situate our problems with respect to known complexity classes.},

We show that a language inclusion problem is decidable whenever this overapproximating abstraction satisfies a completeness condition (i.e., its loss of precision causes no false alarm) and prevents infinite ascending chains (i.e., it guarantees termination of least fixpoint computations). This overapproximating abstraction of languages can be defined using quasiorder relations on words, where the abstraction gives the language of all the words “greater than or equal to” a given input word for that quasiorder. We put forward a range of such quasiorders that allow us to systematically design decision procedures for different language inclusion problems, such as regular languages into regular languages or into trace sets of one-counter nets, and context-free languages into regular languages. In the case of inclusion between regular languages, some of the induced inclusion checking procedures correspond to well-known state-of-the-art algorithms, like the so-called antichain algorithms. Finally, we provide an equivalent language inclusion checking algorithm based on a greatest fixpoint computation that relies on quotients of languages and, to the best of our knowledge, was not previously known.},

  abstract = {Rephotography is the process of recapturing the photograph of a location from the same perspective in which it was captured earlier. A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past. We have achieved good, fully automatic rephotographed results based on façade segmentation using only a single image.},

Our computations are based on an existing discrete model of isometric mappings between surfaces which for this occasion has been refined to obtain higher numerical accuracy.

  abstract = {We present a computational inverse design method for a new class of surface-based inflatable structure. Our deployable structures are fabricated by fusing together two layers of inextensible sheet material along carefully selected curves. The fusing curves form a network of tubular channels that can be inflated with air or other fluids. When fully inflated, the initially flat surface assumes a programmed double-curved shape and becomes stiff and load-bearing. We present a method that solves for the layout of air channels that, when inflated, best approximate a given input design. For this purpose, we integrate a forward simulation method for inflation with a gradient-based optimization algorithm that continuously adapts the geometry of the air channels to improve the design objectives. To initialize this non-linear optimization, we propose a novel surface flattening algorithm. When a channel is inflated, it approximately maintains its length, but contracts transversally to its main direction. Our algorithm approximates this deformation behavior by computing a mapping from the 3D design surface to the plane that allows for anisotropic metric scaling within the bounds realizable by the physical system. We show a wide variety of inflatable designs and fabricate several prototypes to validate our approach and highlight potential applications.},

  abstract = {The edges of an image contains rich visual cognitive cues. However, the edge information of a natural scene usually is only a set of disorganized unorganized pixels for a computer. In psychology, the phenomenon of quickly perceiving global information from a complex pattern is called the global precedence effect (GPE). For example, when one observes the edge map of an image, some contours seem to automatically “pop out” from the complex background. This is a manifestation of GPE on edge information and is called global contour precedence (GCP). The primary visual cortex (V1) is closely related to the processing of edges. In this article, a neural computational model to simulate GCP based on the mechanisms of V1 is presented. There are three layers in the proposed model: the representation of line segments, organization of edges, and perception of global contours. In experiments, the ability to group edges is tested on the public dataset BSDS500. The results show that the grouping performance, robustness, and time cost of the proposed model are superior to those of other methods. In addition, the outputs of the proposed model can also be applied to the generation of object proposals, which indicates that the proposed model can contribute significantly to high-level visual tasks.},

Weingarten surfaces are characterized by a functional relation between their principal curvatures that implicitly defines approximate local congruences on the surface. These symmetries can be exploited to simplify surface paneling of double-curved architectural skins through mold re-use.
          We present an optimization approach to find a Weingarten surface that is close to a given input design. Leveraging insights from differential geometry, our method aligns curvature isolines of the surface in order to contract the curvature diagram from a 2D region into a 1D curve. The unknown functional curvature relation then emerges as the result of the optimization. We show how a robust and efficient numerical shape approximation method can be implemented using a guided projection approach on a high-order B-spline representation. This algorithm is applied in several design studies to illustrate how Weingarten surfaces define a versatile shape space for fabrication-aware exploration in freeform architecture. Our optimization algorithm provides the first practical tool to compute general Weingarten surfaces with arbitrary curvature relation, thus enabling new investigations into a rich, but as of yet largely unexplored class of surfaces.},

Through online evaluations, we compared different types of intent-expressive motions both in terms of legibility as well as glanceability, a measure we introduce to gauge an observer’s ability to predict robots’ intent pre-attentively. The results show that the collective behavior-based motion has the best legibility performance overall, whereas, for glanceability, trajectory-based legible motion is most effective. These results suggest that the optimal solution may involve a combination of these legibility cues based on the scenario and the desired properties of the motion.},

Three different approaches were pursued, two with direct or random associations and a third using a genetic algorithm that considers music and color theory while searching for better results. The resulting images were evaluated through online surveys, which confirmed that not only they were abstract, but also that there was a relationship with the music that served as the basis for the association process. Moreover, the majority of the participants ranked highest the images improved with the genetic algorithm.

Concerning the converse translation, we show that for Kt extended with path axioms, every derivation in the corresponding labeled calculus can be put into a special form that is translatable to a derivation in the associated display calculus. A key insight in this converse translation is a canonical representation of display sequents as labeled polytrees. Labeled polytrees, which represent equivalence classes of display sequents modulo display postulates, also shed light on related correspondence results for tense logics.},

  abstract = {This article studies a large class of two-player perfect-information turn-based parity games on infinite graphs, namely, those generated by collapsible pushdown automata. The main motivation for studying these games comes from the connections from collapsible pushdown automata and higher-order recursion schemes, both models being equi-expressive for generating infinite trees. Our main result is to establish the decidability of such games and to provide an effective representation of the winning region as well as of a winning strategy. Thus, the results obtained here provide all necessary tools for an in-depth study of logical properties of trees generated by collapsible pushdown automata/recursion schemes.},

We give systems for the normal modal logics from K to S4. For the intuitionistic versions of the systems, we define proof reduction, and prove proof normalization, thus obtaining a syntactical proof of consistency. For logics K and K4 we use existence predicates (à la Scott) for formulating sound deduction rules.},

A consistent brand will generate trust and retain customers over time as they develop an affinity toward regularity and common patterns. However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content that needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles that are not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making a web article more consistent with the company’s brand personality.},

            , which for every player will either satisfy or fail to satisfy their goal. Players are assumed to act strategically, taking into account the goals of other players, in an attempt to bring about computations satisfying their goal. In this setting, we apply the standard game-theoretic concept of (pure) Nash equilibria. The (possibly empty) set of Nash equilibria of an iterated Boolean game can be understood as inducing a set of computations, each computation representing one way the system could evolve if players chose strategies that together constitute a Nash equilibrium. Such a set of equilibrium computations expresses a temporal property—which may or may not be expressible within a particular
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            fragment. The new notion of expressiveness that we formally define and investigate is then as follows:
            
              What temporal properties are characterised by the Nash equilibria of games in which agent goals are expressed in specific fragments of 
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            ? We formally define and investigate this notion of expressiveness for a range of
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            fragments. For example, a very natural question is the following:
            
              Suppose we have an iterated Boolean game in which every goal is represented using a particular fragment

              : is it then always the case that the equilibria of the game can be characterised within

This is a very natural extension that has not been studied so far. We show that the restriction without the separating implication can be solved in polynomial space by using an appropriate abstraction for memory states, whereas the full extension is shown undecidable by reduction from first-order separation logic. Many variants of the logic and fragments are also investigated from the computational point of view when ls is added, providing numerous results about adding reachability predicates to quantifier-free separation logic.},

  abstract = {When middle school students encounter computer models of science phenomenon in science class, how do they think those computer models work? Computer models operationalize real-world behaviors of selected variables, and can simulate interactions between the modeled elements through programmed instructions. This study explores how middle school students think about the high-level semantic meaning of those instructions, which we term
            rules
            . To investigate this aspect of students’ computational thinking, we developed the Computational Modeling Inventory and administered it to 253 7
            th
            grade students. The Inventory included three computer models that students interacted with during the assessment. In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the “typical” questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2--10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.},

  abstract = {CSCW researchers have long inquired into the ways that identity informs, and is informed by, the design of technological systems. Gender is a regularly considered aspect of identity, with extensive work documenting and exploring gendered experiences and designs with the aim of addressing inequalities in, or through, design. Recent work has questioned the way that we conceptualise and "measure" gender, advocating more nuanced classificatory schemes to avoid silencing or obscuring trans and/or non-binary experiences. Building on and extending this research, our work examines how gender is conceptualised more broadly. Drawing from a range of theoretical perspectives in gender studies, feminist and postcolonial theory, we argue for the treatment of gender as "multiplicitous" when we conceptualise and interpret research, in order to avoid unintentionally perpetuating silencing and inequality even as we work to tackle it. Illustrating our argument with examples from both within and without CSCW, we suggest both new research directions for CSCW scholars inquiring into gender, and sensitising questions that scholars can use when constructing and evaluating studies.},

  abstract = {A growing number of people are using catch-up TV services rather than watching simultaneously with other audience members at the time of broadcast. However, computational support for such catching-up users has not been well explored. In particular, we are observing an emerging phenomenon in online media consumption experiences in which speculation plays a vital role. As the phenomenon of speculation implicitly assumes simultaneity in media consumption, there is a gap for catching-up users, who cannot directly appreciate the consumption experiences. This conversely suggests that there is potential for computational support to enhance the consumption experiences of catching-up users. Accordingly, we conducted a series of studies to pave the way for developing computational support for catching-up users. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how people are engaging with speculation during media consumption. As a result, we discovered the distinctive aspects of speculation-based consumption experiences in contrast to social viewing experiences sharing immediate reactions that have been discussed in previous studies. We then designed two prototypes for supporting catching-up users based on our quantitative analysis of Twitter data in regard to reaction- and speculation-based media consumption. Lastly, we evaluated the prototypes in a user experiment and, based on its results, discussed ways to empower catching-up users with computational supports in response to recent transformations in media consumption.},

  abstract = {Last November (2020) the SIGCAS executive board conducted a survey of SIGCAS members to get a picture of who we are, where we come from, what we're interested in, and what the membership would like to see the board do to better fulfill its mission. Based on discussions with the executive board, SIGCAS Vice Chair Lisa Kaczmarczyk implemented the survey using Survey Monkey. As with all surveys one can't get all the information one would like and the more information one tries to obtain, the fewer people are likely to supply it. We settled on eight questions and we received input from 68 people, about 23% of our membership (then just under 300 people---now slightly over).
          What follows is a presentation of the survey results along with some commentary. How I interpret the data and what I think ought to (or could) be done with the data might not be how you'd interpret the data and think about what ought to be done. And that's a good discussion to have! At any rate, the responses that we've received represent a valuable part of our collective intelligence, consciousness, and visions for the future. The hope is that these will inform out work going forward.
          Please note that I'm not doing any professional analysis since I'm not qualified to do that. I also suspect that the wisdom we can glean wouldn't be found via additional number crunching. And I would also add that there are dangers to reading too much into survey data. As a precaution I have asked the other board members to take a look at this article so I don't get anything terribly wrong.
          Just a reminder that the data we have doesn't necessarily reflect the totality of what our entire membership would provide. (Although, as one somewhat validating figure, the percentage of people outside of North America on our roster is about the same as the percentage of people who told us they were from outside North America on the survey, 72%.) Also, I'm trying to avoid the temptation to comment on everything. There's too much material for that. And, obviously, there are too many suggestions and ideas out there for SIGCAS to move on all of them. But based on these responses a multitude of useful information is now available and it should help lead us into productive discussions and actions.},

Today, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. This provides a unique opportunity for researchers and health practitioners to proactively identify linguistic markers or patterns that correlate with mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or suicide behaviour. This survey describes and reviews the approaches that have been proposed for mental state assessment and identification of disorders using online digital records. The presented studies are organised according to the assessment technology and the feature extraction process conducted. We also present a series of studies which explore different aspects of the language and behaviour of individuals suffering from mental disorders, and discuss various aspects related to the development of experimental frameworks. Furthermore, ethical considerations regarding the treatment of individuals’ data are outlined. The main contributions of this survey are a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches for online mental state assessment on social media, a structured categorisation of the methods according to their design principles, lessons learnt over the years and a discussion on possible avenues for future research.},

However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.},

  abstract = {Emerging memcapacitive nanoscale devices have the potential to perform computations in new ways. In this article, we systematically study, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the computational capacity of complex memcapacitive networks, which function as reservoirs inreservoir computing,one of the brain-inspired computing architectures. Memcapacitive networks are composed of memcapacitive devices randomly connected through nanowires. Previous studies have shown that both regular and random reservoirs provide sufficient dynamics to perform simple tasks. How do complex memcapacitive networks illustrate their computational capability, and what are the topological structures of memcapacitive networks that solve complex tasks with efficiency? Studies show that small-world power-law (SWPL) networks offer an ideal trade-off between the communication properties and the wiring cost of networks. In this study, we illustrate the computing nature of SWPL memcapacitive reservoirs by exploring the two essential properties: fading memory and linear separation through measurements of kernel quality. Compared to ideal reservoirs, nanowire memcapacitive reservoirs had a better dynamic response and improved their performance by 4.67% on three tasks: MNIST, Isolated Spoken Digits, and CIFAR-10. On the same three tasks, compared to memristive reservoirs, nanowire memcapacitive reservoirs achieved comparable performance with much less power, on average, about 99× , 17×, and 277×, respectively. Simulation results of the topological transformation of memcapacitive networks reveal that that topological structures of the memcapacitive SWPL reservoirs did not affect their performance but significantly contributed to the wiring cost and the power consumption of the systems. The minimum trade-off between the wiring cost and the power consumption occurred at different network settings ofαandβ: 4.5 and 0.61 forBiolekreservoirs, 2.7 and 1.0 forMohamedreservoirs, and 3.0 and 1.0 forNajemreservoirs. The results of our research illustrate the computational capacity of complex memcapacitive networks as reservoirs in reservoir computing. Such memcapacitive networks with an SWPL topology are energy-efficient systems that are suitable for low-power applications such as mobile devices and the Internet of Things.},

First, I am subconsciously scanning for risks and liability everywhere, fabricating fictitious lawsuits in my head that might occur. Second, I care a lot about words, what exactly was said, and the meaning and truthfulness of the assertion when a strict vs. lenient interpretation of those words is applied. Third, I have the ability to navigate complex systems and to guide others less familiar with those systems through the maze. Finally, I have acquired a sobering view of what the legal system does and does not do, its promise and its shortcomings.},

The problem is known to be NP-hard and in PSPACE, and this article establishes its PSPACE-completeness. Next, string avoidability over the binary alphabet is interpreted as a version of conjunctive normal form satisfiability problem, where each clause has infinitely many shifted variants. Non-satisfiability of these formulas can be proved using variants of classical propositional proof systems, augmented with derivation rules for shifting proof lines (such as clauses, inequalities, polynomials, etc.). First, it is proved that there is a particular formula that has a short refutation in Resolution with a shift rule but requires classical proofs of exponential size. At the same time, it is shown that exponential lower bounds for classical proof systems can be translated for their shifted versions. Finally, it is shown that superpolynomial lower bounds on the size of shifted proofs would separate NP from PSPACE; a connection to lower bounds on circuit complexity is also established.},

In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

In this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. We find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction.

This work calls attention to the diversity of coordinative, social, and organizational practices and concerns that are needed to integrate data and also how, in highly innovative work, the process of integrating data also helps to define scientific problem spaces themselves.},

  abstract = {Approximation fixpoint theory (AFT) is an algebraic study of fixpoints of lattice operators that unifies various knowledge representation formalisms. In AFT, stratification of operators has been studied, essentially resulting in a theory that specifies when certain types of fixpoints can be computed stratum per stratum. Recently, novel types of fixpoints related to
            groundedness
            have been introduced in AFT. In this article, we study how those fixpoints behave under stratified operators.
          
          
            One recent application domain of AFT is the field of
            active integrity constraints
            (AICs). We apply our extended stratification theory to AICs and find that existing notions of stratification in AICs are covered by this general algebraic definition of stratification. As a result, we obtain stratification results for a large variety of semantics for AICs.},

As this logic naturally captures multi-player games with imperfect information, this problem is undecidable; but we introduce a syntactical class of “hierarchical instances” for which, intuitively, as one goes down the syntactic tree of the formula, strategy quantifications are concerned with finer observations of the model, and we prove that model-checking SL

            restricted to hierarchical instances is decidable. This result, because it allows for complex patterns of existential and universal quantification on strategies, greatly generalises the decidability of distributed synthesis for systems with hierarchical information. It allows us to easily derive new decidability results concerning strategic problems under imperfect information such as the existence of Nash equilibria or rational synthesis.

  abstract = {Dependently typed programming languages and proof assistants such as Agda and Coq rely on computation to automatically simplify expressions during type checking. To overcome the lack of certain programming primitives or logical principles in those systems, it is common to appeal to axioms to postulate their existence. However, one can only postulate the bare existence of an axiom, not its computational behaviour. Instead, users are forced to postulate equality proofs and appeal to them explicitly to simplify expressions, making axioms dramatically more complicated to work with than built-in primitives. On the other hand, the equality reflection rule from extensional type theory solves these problems by collapsing computation and equality, at the cost of having no practical type checking algorithm. This paper introduces Rewriting Type Theory (RTT), a type theory where it is possible to add computational assumptions in the form of rewrite rules. Rewrite rules go beyond the computational capabilities of intensional type theory, but in contrast to extensional type theory, they are applied automatically so type checking does not require input from the user. To ensure type soundness of RTT—as well as effective type checking—we provide a framework where confluence of user-defined rewrite rules can be checked modularly and automatically, and where adding new rewrite rules is guaranteed to preserve subject reduction. The properties of RTT have been formally verified using the MetaCoq framework and an implementation of rewrite rules is already available in the Agda proof assistant.},

We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types, a negative type, and a dual to product types, a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics, we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that ``reverses execution flow'' and a fractional type represents a computational effect that ``garbage collects'' particular values or throws exceptions.Specifically, we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types, specify an operational semantics for each extension, and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics, most of its meta-theoretic properties, and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.},

          The positive result is the decidability of the emptiness problem for the case of Büchi acceptance condition.

Instead, we directly construct an emptiness game making use of imperfect information.
          The negative result is the undecidability of the emptiness problem for the case of co-Büchi acceptance condition. This result has two direct consequences: the undecidability of monadic second-order logic extended with the qualitative path-measure quantifier and the undecidability of the emptiness problem for alternating tree automata with non-zero semantics, a recently introduced probabilistic model of alternating tree automata.},

To do this, we adopt a qualitative methodology based on the study of 10 cases, using the WarVG-A (War video game evaluation) instrument to perform the content analysis, based on six dimensions (cognitive, personal-attitudinal, ethical, logical, argumentative, and expressive-communicative) with different indicators and categories. The results of the analysis indicate that these primary games terrorist tactics and historical adaptation, addressing war from a critical approach. Most evidence ethical dilemmas such as child soldiers, the economics of war (arms sales and conflict perpetuation). Economic and geo-political interests are the engines that drive wars, considered inevitable to defend themselves. The stereotypes that abound are gender and ethnic warmongers represented by photorealistic and cinematographic aesthetics. Only four of the selected playful artifacts can identify tools capable of driving critical thinking, inviting players to reflect on war from a more realistic position and emotionally involving them. However, the explicit representation of violence limits its use in school contexts.},

  abstract = {This article deals with advanced notions of equivalence between nonmonotonic logic programs under the answer-set semantics, a topic of considerable interest, because such notions form the basis for program verification and are useful for program optimisation, debugging, and modular programming. In fact, there is extensive research in answer-set programming (ASP) dealing with different notions of equivalence between programs. Prominent among these notions is
            uniform equivalence
            , which checks whether two programs have the same semantics when joined with an arbitrary set of facts. In this article, we study a family of more fine-grained versions of uniform equivalence, viz.
            relativised uniform equivalence with projection
            , which extends standard uniform equivalence in terms of two additional parameters: one for specifying the input alphabet and one for specifying the output alphabet for programs. In particular, the second parameter is used for
            projecting
            answer sets to a set of designated output atoms. Answer-set projection, in particular, allows to compare programs that make use of different auxiliary atoms, which is important for practical programming aspects. We introduce novel semantic characterisations for the program correspondence problems under consideration and analyse their computational complexity. In the general case, deciding these problems lies on the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Therefore, this task cannot be efficiently reduced to propositional answer-set programs itself (under the usual complexity-theoretic assumptions). However, reductions to
            quantified Boolean formulas
            (QBFs) are feasible. Indeed, we provide efficient (in fact, linear-time constructible) reductions to QBFs and discuss simplifications for certain special cases. These QBF reductions yield the basis for a prototype implementation, the system cc ⊤, for deciding correspondence problems by using off-the-shelf QBF solvers. We discuss an application of cc ⊤ for verifying the correctness of solutions by students drawn from a laboratory course on logic programming and knowledge representation at the Technische Universität Wien, employing relativised uniform equivalence with projection as the underlying program correspondence notion.},

  abstract = {Cold bent glass is a promising and cost-efficient method for realizing doubly curved glass façades. They are produced by attaching planar glass sheets to curved frames and must keep the occurring stress within safe limits. However, it is very challenging to navigate the design space of cold bent glass panels because of the fragility of the material, which impedes the form finding for practically feasible and aesthetically pleasing cold bent glass façades. We propose an interactive, data-driven approach for designing cold bent glass façades that can be seamlessly integrated into a typical architectural design pipeline. Our method allows non-expert users to interactively edit a parametric surface while providing real-time feedback on the deformed shape and maximum stress of cold bent glass panels. The designs are automatically refined to minimize several fairness criteria, while maximal stresses are kept within glass limits. We achieve interactive frame rates by using a differentiable Mixture Density Network trained from more than a million simulations. Given a curved boundary, our regression model is capable of handling multistable configurations and accurately predicting the equilibrium shape of the panel and its corresponding maximal stress. We show that the predictions are highly accurate and validate our results with a physical realization of a cold bent glass surface.},

Many, if not most, of these attempts are based on preferential extensions of description logics, with a significant number of these, in turn, following the so-called KLM approach to defeasible reasoning initially advocated for propositional logic by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor. Each of these attempts has its own aim of investigating particular constructions and variants of the (KLM-style) preferential approach. Here our aim is to provide a comprehensive study of the formal foundations of preferential defeasible reasoning for description logics in the KLM tradition.We start by investigating a notion ofdefeasible subsumptionin the spirit of defeasible conditionals as studied by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor in the propositional case. In particular, we consider a natural and intuitive semantics for defeasible subsumption, and we investigate KLM-style syntactic properties for bothpreferentialandrationalsubsumption. Our contribution includes two representation results linking our semantic constructions to the set of preferential and rational properties considered. Besides showing that our semantics is appropriate, these results pave the way for more effective decision procedures for defeasible reasoning in description logics. Indeed, we also analyse the problem of non-monotonic reasoning in description logics at the level ofentailmentand present an algorithm for the computation ofrational closureof a defeasible knowledge base. Importantly, our algorithm relies completely on classical entailment and shows that the computational complexity of reasoning over defeasible knowledge bases is no worse than that of reasoning in the underlying classical DLALC.},

They must contend with a multitude of possible security options that they may only partially understand. This challenge is met by decision makers’
            risk thinking

The logic, which represents the logical counterpart of history-preserving bisimilarity, is naturally interpreted over event structures or any formalism that can be given a causal semantics, like Petri nets. It includes least and greatest fixpoint operators and thus it can express properties of infinite computations. Since the event structure associated with a system is typically infinite (even if the system is finite state), already the decidability of model-checking is non-trivial. We first develop a local model-checking technique based on a tableau system, for which, over a class of event structures satisfying a suitable regularity condition, referred to as strong regularity, we prove termination, soundness, and completeness. The tableau system allows for a clean and intuitive proof of decidability, but a direct implementation of the procedure can be extremely inefficient. For easing the development of a more efficient model-checking technique, we move to an automata-theoretic framework. Given a formula and a strongly regular event structure, we show how to construct a parity tree automaton whose language is non-empty if and only if the event structure satisfies the formula. The automaton is usually infinite. We discuss how it can be quotiented to an equivalent finite automaton, where emptiness can be checked effectively. To show the applicability of the approach, we discuss how it instantiates to finite safe Petri nets, providing also a corresponding proof-of-concept model-checking tool.},

In this article, we propose a new generalization of strong equivalence (SE) that takes the visibility of atoms into account and we characterize it in terms of appropriately revised SE-models. Our design resembles (relativized) strong equivalence but is substantially different due to adopting a strict one-to-one correspondence of models from the notion of visible equivalence. We additionally tailor the characterization for more convenient use with positive programs and provide formal tools to exploit the tailored version also in the case of some programs that use negation. We illustrate the use of visible strong equivalence and the characterizations in showing the correctness of program transformations that make use of atom visibility. Moreover, we present a translation that enables us to automate the task of verifying visible strong equivalence for particular fragments of answer-set programs. We experimentally study the efficiency of verification when the goal is to check whether an extended rule is visibly strongly equivalent to its normalization, i.e., a subprogram expressing the original rule in terms of normal rules only. In the process, we verify the outputs of several real implementations of normalization schemes on a considerable number of input rules.},

Decidability results are known for certain restricted logics with respect to these semantics, subject to a variety of restrictions that are either unexplained or involve a longstanding unsolved mathematical problem. We show that mild generalizations of the known decidable cases suffice to render the model checking problem definitively undecidable. In particular, for the synchronous perfect recall semantics, a generalization from temporal operators with finite reach to operators with infinite reach renders model checking undecidable. The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic second-order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable, except on a set of measure zero. We show that two distinct extensions of this logic make model checking undecidable. One of these involves polynomial combinations of probability terms, the other involves monadic second-order quantification into the scope of probability operators.

  abstract = {This is a consolidated look at computational techniques for sustainability, and their limits and possibilities. Sustainability is already well established as a concern and a topic of study and practice, given the alarming increase of environmental degradation, pollution, and other adverse effects of industrialization and urbanization. Computational sustainability, which focuses on the use of effective computational models and computational approaches to help achieve the goal of sustainability, has attracted interest from computer science researchers worldwide. We review recent work on computational techniques applied to a range of domains related to sustainability, from bio-surveillance to poverty mapping, from renewable energy production forecasting to crop disease monitoring, and from agent-based modeling to stochastic network design. In sustainable computing, we discuss some directions that have recently been explored. Finally, we analyze research directions that could be explored in the future to achieve the goal of long-term environmental sustainability.},

  abstract = {Convex variational problems arise in many fields ranging from image processing to fluid and solid mechanics communities. Interesting applications usually involve non-smooth terms, which require well-designed optimization algorithms for their resolution. The present manuscript presents the Python package called fenics_optim built on top of the FEniCS finite element software, which enables one to automate the formulation and resolution of various convex variational problems. Formulating such a problem relies on FEniCS domain-specific language and the representation of convex functions, in particular, non-smooth ones, in the conic programming framework. The discrete formulation of the corresponding optimization problems hinges on the finite element discretization capabilities offered by FEniCS, while their numerical resolution is carried out by the interior-point solver Mosek. Through various illustrative examples, we show that convex optimization problems can be formulated using only a few lines of code, discretized in a very simple manner, and solved extremely efficiently.},

We demonstrate our approach by generating personalized patterns for various body shapes and a diverse set of garments with complex pattern layouts.},

Transitive closure logic is a known extension of first-order logic that is particularly straightforward to automate. While other extensions of first-order logic with inductive definitions are
            a priori
            parametrized by a set of inductive definitions, the addition of a single transitive closure operator has the advantage of uniformly capturing all finitary inductive definitions. To further improve the reasoning techniques for transitive closure logic, we here present an

We show that the infinitary system is complete for the standard semantics and subsumes the explicit system. Moreover, the uniformity of the transitive closure operator allows semantically meaningful complete restrictions to be defined using simple syntactic criteria. Consequently, the restriction to regular infinitary (i.e.,

While most of the work on combining description logics (DLs) with temporal logics has concentrated on qualitative temporal logics, there is a growing interest in extending this work to the quantitative case. In this article, we complement existing results on the combination of DLs with metric temporal logics by introducing
            interval-rigid
            concept and role names. Elements included in an interval-rigid concept or role name are required to stay in it for some specified amount of time. We investigate several combinations of (metric) temporal logics with

Following this, a finite-element discretization of both procedures is discussed, an algorithm for running the flow is given, and an application to mesh editing is presented.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant source of suffering, disability and societal cost in the US. However, while the ability to detect a person's risk for developing persistent pain is desirable for timely assessment, management, treatment, and reduced health care costs---no objective measure to detect clinical pain intensity exist. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have deployed clinical decision- making and assessment tools to enhance pain risk detection across core social and clinical domains. Yet, risk assessment models are only as "good" as the data they are based on. Thus, ensuring fairness is also a critical component of equitable care in both the short and long term. This paper takes an intersectional and public health approach to AI fairness in the context of pain and invisible disability, suggesting that computational ethnography is a multimodal and participatory real-world data (RWD) methodology that can be used to enhance the curation of intersectional knowledge bases, thereby expanding existing boundaries of AI fairness in terms of inclusiveness and transparency for pain and invisible disability use cases.},

Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, combined with nonassociative floating point addition, makes reproducibility challenging even for summation, or operations like the BLAS. We describe a “reproducible accumulator” data structure (the “binned number”) and associated algorithms to reproducibly sum binary floating point numbers, independent of summation order. We use a subset of the IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008 and bitwise operations on the standard representations in memory. Our approach requires only one read-only pass over the data, and one reduction in parallel, using a 6-word reproducible accumulator (more words can be used for higher accuracy), enabling standard tiling optimization techniques. Summing
            n
            words with a 6-word reproducible accumulator requires approximately 9

In this article, we give the first decidability results for FQA that combine both referential constraints and number restrictions for arbitrary signatures: We show that, for unary inclusion dependencies and functional dependencies, the finiteness assumption of FQA can be lifted up to taking the finite implication closure of the dependencies. Our result relies on new techniques to construct finite universal models of such constraints for any bound on the maximal query size.},

In this article, we propose a novel attack on the EEG-based authentication systems by investigating and leveraging the strong correlation between hand movements and brain signals captured through the motion sensors on a smartwatch and the wearable EEG headset, respectively. Based on this technique, we can successfully estimate the user’s EEG signals from the stolen hand movement data while the user was typing on the keyboard. Our attack results on the EEG biometric authentication system show an increase in the mean equal error rates of the classifiers by between 180% and 360% based on a dataset of 59 users. In summary, our pilot study calls for a rethinking of EEG-based authentication mechanisms from the perspective of unique vulnerabilities, particularly for multimodal biometric systems involving a variety of wearable or mobile devices.},

Afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance.

The standard models and refinement relations of CSP, however, do not differentiate inputs and outputs and are not, therefore, entirely suitable for testing. Here, we consider an alphabet of events partitioned into inputs and outputs, and we present a novel refusal-testing model for CSP with a notion of input-output refusal-traces refinement. We compare that with the ioco relation often used in testing, and we find that it is more widely applicable and stronger. This means that mistakes found using traditional ioco testing do indicate mistakes in the development. Finally, we provide a CSP testing theory that takes into account inputs and outputs. With our theory, it becomes feasible to develop techniques and tools for automatic generation of realistic and sound tests from CSP models. Our work reconciles the normally disparate areas of refinement and (formal) testing by identifying how ioco testing can be used to inform refinement-based results and vice-versa.},

  abstract = {Timed Automata (TA) is de facto a standard modelling formalism to represent systems when the interest is the analysis of their behaviour as time progresses. This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the behaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if efficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily configurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed Automata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication procedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second, they usually do not support the Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and rely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is specified, which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not easily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in different contexts.
          This article presents a novel technique to perform model checking of Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The technique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an intermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula, which is verified through an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible, since the intermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA constructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is not bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be verified using different procedures.},

As the era of Moore’s law draws to a close, many new non–von Neumann processors are emerging as potential computational accelerators, including those based on the principles of neuromorphic computing, tensor algebra, and quantum information. While development of these new processors is continuing to mature, the potential impact on accelerated computing is anticipated to be profound. We discuss how different processing models can advance computing in key scientific paradigms: machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications. This also hints at the infrastructure needed to integrate next-generation processing units into future high-performance computing systems.},

The problem of verifying whether a formula of these logics is true on a given structure is considered intractable in general, but it does become tractable on interesting classes of structures, such as on classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded treewidth. In this article, we continue this line of research and study model-checking for first- and monadic second-order logic in the presence of an ordering on the input structure. We do so in two settings: the general ordered case, where the input structures are equipped with a fixed order or successor relation, and the order-invariant case, where the formulas may resort to an ordering, but their truth must be independent of the particular choice of order. In the first setting we show very strong intractability results for most interesting classes of structures. In contrast, in the order-invariant case we obtain tractability results for order-invariant monadic second-order formulas on the same classes of graphs as in the unordered case. For first-order logic, we obtain tractability of successor-invariant formulas on classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded expansion. Furthermore, we show that model-checking for order-invariant first-order formulas is tractable on coloured posets of bounded width.},

  abstract = {This article builds on prior work that aims to measure computational learning (CL) during middle school. Since game computational sophistication (GCS) has been used as a proxy for a student’s engagement in CL we build on their model to more completely describe the relationship between different types of building blocks of computer games and GCS. In doing so, we present a single quantitative measurement for GCS. Our model, called
            GCS 2.0
            , has face validity for 39 games, each programmed by a pair of middle school children. We choose four of these games, two with high GCS and two with low GCS, and discuss the computational building blocks found in each game. We do this to help the reader better understand our measurement of GCS and its relationship to CL.},

  abstract = {Parquetry is the art and craft of decorating a surface with a pattern of differently colored veneers of wood, stone, or other materials. Traditionally, the process of designing and making parquetry has been driven by color, using the texture found in real wood only for stylization or as a decorative effect. Here, we introduce a computational pipeline that draws from the rich natural structure of strongly textured real-world veneers as a source of detail to approximate a target image as faithfully as possible using a manageable number of parts. This challenge is closely related to the established problems of patch-based image synthesis and stylization in some ways, but fundamentally different in others. Most importantly, the limited availability of resources (any piece of wood can only be used once) turns the relatively simple problem of finding the right piece for the target location into the combinatorial problem of finding optimal parts while avoiding resource collisions. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently solves an approximation to the problem. It further addresses challenges like gamut mapping, feature characterization, and the search for fabricable cuts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by fabricating a selection of pieces of parquetry from different kinds of unstained wood veneer.},

  abstract = {A liquid type is an ordinary Hindley-Milner type annotated with a logical predicate that states the properties satisfied by the elements of that type. Liquid types are a powerful tool for program verification, as programmers can use them to specify pre- and post conditions of their programs, whereas the predicates of intermediate variables and auxiliary functions are inferred automatically. Type inference is feasible in this context, as the logical predicates within liquid types are constrained to a quantifier-free logic to maintain decidability.
          In this article, we extend liquid types by allowing them to contain quantified properties on arrays so that they can be used to infer invariants on array-related programs (e.g., implementations of sorting algorithms). Although quantified logic is, in general, undecidable, we restrict properties on arrays to a decidable subset introduced by Bradley et al. We describe in detail the extended type system, the verification condition generator, and the iterative weakening algorithm for inferring invariants. After proving the correctness and completeness of these two algorithms, we apply them to find invariants on a set of algorithms involving array manipulations.},

            ML of μML on the modal side and one for WMSO, weak monadic second-order logic, on the second-order side. In the setting of binary trees, with explicit functions accessing the left and right successor of a node, it was known that WMSO is equivalent to the appropriate version of alternation-free μ-calculus. Our analysis shows that the picture changes radically once we consider, as Janin and Walukiewicz did, the standard modal μ-calculus, interpreted over arbitrary LTSs.
          
          
            The first theorem that we prove is that, over LTSs, μ
            
              N
            
            ML is equivalent modulo bisimilarity to

            MSO (NMSO), a newly introduced variant of SMSO where second-order quantification ranges over “conversely well-founded” subsets only. Our second theorem starts from WMSO and proves it equivalent modulo bisimilarity to a fragment of μ
            
              N
            
            ML defined by a notion of continuity. Analogously to Janin and Walukiewicz’s result, our proofs are automata-theoretic in nature: As another contribution, we introduce classes of parity automata characterising the expressiveness of WMSO and NMSO (on tree models) and of μ

It is known that model checking one-counter machines against formulas of Freeze LTL (FLTL), a strict fragment of TPTL, is undecidable. We prove that in our setting, MTL is strictly less expressive than TPTL, and incomparable in expressiveness to FLTL, so undecidability for MTL is not implied by the result for FLTL. We show, however, that the model-checking problem for MTL is undecidable. We further prove that the satisfiability problem for the unary fragments of TPTL and MTL are undecidable; for TPTL, this even holds for the fragment in which only one register and the finally modality is used. This is opposed to a known decidability result for the satisfiability problem for the same fragment of FLTL.},

Further, we conceive a method of QBF solving in which dependency recomputation is utilised as a form of inprocessing. Formalising this notion, we introduce a new version of Q-resolution in which a dependency scheme is applied dynamically. We demonstrate the further potential of this approach beyond that of the existing static system with an exponential separation. Last, we show that the same picture emerges in an analogous approach to the universal expansion paradigm.},

A natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this article, we present a transfer result applying to this construction: We show that for suitable logically defined classes, separation for the logic enriched with the successor relation reduces to separation for the original logic. Our theorem also applies to a problem that is stronger than separation: covering. Moreover, we actually present two reductions: one for languages of finite words and the other for languages of infinite words.},

The resulting video illustrates the given narrative, provides diverse visual content, and follows cinematographic guidelines. The process involves three simple steps: (1) the user provides input, mostly in the form of editing the text, (2) the tool automatically searches for semantically matching candidate shots from the video repository, and (3) an optimization method assembles the video montage. Visual-semantic matching between segmented text and shots is performed by cascaded keyword matching and visual-semantic embedding, that have better accuracy than alternative solutions. The video assembly is formulated as a hybrid optimization problem over a graph of shots, considering temporal constraints, cinematography metrics such as camera movement and tone, and user-specified cinematography idioms. Using our system, users without video editing experience are able to generate appealing videos.},

Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.},

In this paper, we study the consistency of team fracture: a loss of team viability so severe that the team no longer wants to work together. Understanding whether team fracture is driven by the membership of the team, or by how their collaboration unfolded, motivates the design of interventions that either identify compatible teammates or ensure effective early interactions. We introduce an online experiment that reconvenes the same team without members realizing that they have worked together before, enabling us to temporarily erase previous team dynamics. Participants in our study completed a series of tasks across multiple teams, including one reconvened team, and privately blacklisted any teams that they would not want to work with again. We identify fractured teams as those blacklisted by half the members. We find that reconvened teams are strikingly polarized by task in the consistency of their fracture outcomes. On a creative task, teams might as well have been a completely different set of people: the same teams changed their fracture outcomes at a random chance rate. On a cognitive conflict and on an intellective task, the team instead replayed the same dynamics without realizing it, rarely changing their fracture outcomes. These results indicate that, for some tasks, team fracture can be strongly influenced by interactions in the first moments of a team's collaboration, and that interventions targeting these initial moments may be critical to scaffolding long-lasting teams.},

Next, we develop an algorithm that takes an arbitrary idempotent anti-unification problem and computes a representation of its solution set in the form of a regular tree grammar. The algorithm does not depend on the number of idempotent function symbols in the input terms. The language generated by the grammar is the minimal complete set of generalizations of the given anti-unification problem, which implies that idempotent anti-unification is infinitary.},

However, existing prefetchers can only target premeditated patterns and relations they were designed to handle and are unable to capture access patterns in which they do not specialize. In this article, we propose a context-based neural network (NN) prefetcher that dynamically adapts to arbitrary memory access patterns. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning, the proposed NN prefetcher correlates program and machine contextual information with memory accesses patterns, using online-training to identify and dynamically adapt to unique access patterns exhibited by the code. By targeting
            semantic locality
            in this manner, the prefetcher can discern the useful context attributes and learn to predict previously undetected access patterns, even within noisy memory access streams. We further present an architectural implementation of our NN prefetcher, explore its power, energy, and area limitations, and propose several optimizations. We evaluate the neural network prefetcher over SPEC2006, Graph500, and several microbenchmarks and show that the prefetcher can deliver an average speedup of 21.3% for SPEC2006 (up to 2.3×) and up to 4.4× on kernels over a baseline of PC-based stride prefetcher and 30% for SPEC2006 over a baseline with no prefetching.},

In this article, we argue that the real breakthrough of this technique is the recent introduction of its version for indistinguishability [9], because, with the extensions we introduce here, for the first time, there is a computationally sound symbolic technique that is syntactically strikingly simple, to which translating standard computational security notions is a straightforward matter, and that can be effectively used for verification of not only equivalence properties but trace properties of protocols as well. We first fully develop the core elements of this newer version by introducing several new axioms. We illustrate the power and the diverse use of the introduced axioms on simple examples first. We introduce an axiom expressing the Decisional Diffie-Hellman property. We analyze the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, both in its simplest form and an authenticated version as well. We provide computationally sound verification of real-or-random secrecy of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for multiple sessions, without any restrictions on the computational implementation other than the DDH assumption. We also show authentication for a simplified version of the station-to-station protocol using UF-CMA assumption for digital signatures. Finally, we axiomatize IND-CPA, IND-CCA1, and IND-CCA2 security properties and illustrate their usage. We have formalized the axiomatic system in an interactive theorem prover, Coq, and have machine-checked the proofs of various auxiliary theorems and security properties of Diffie-Hellman and station-to-station protocol.},

The logic’s main novelty is a new three-valued semantics that is well suited for runtime verification as it accounts for partial knowledge about a system’s behavior. Based on this semantics, we present online algorithms that reason soundly and completely about streams where events can occur out of order. We also evaluate our algorithms experimentally. Depending on the specification, our prototype implementation scales to out-of-order streams with hundreds to thousands of events per second.},

  abstract = {We reconsider the problem of containment of monadic datalog (MDL) queries in unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs). Prior work has dealt with special cases of the problem but has left the precise complexity characterization open. In addition, the complexity of one important special case, that of containment under access patterns, was not known before. We start by revisiting the connection between MDL/UCQ containment and containment problems involving regular tree languages. We then present a general approach for getting tighter bounds on the complexity of query containment, based on analysis of the number of mappings of queries into tree-like instances. We give two applications of the machinery. We first give an important special case of the MDL/UCQ containment problem that is in EXPTIME, and we use this bound to show an EXPTIME bound on containment under access patterns. Second, we show that the same technique can be used to get a new tight upper bound for containment of tree automata in UCQs. We finally show that the new MDL/UCQ upper bounds are tight. We establish a 2EXPTIME lower bound on the MDL/UCQ containment problem, resolving an open problem from the early 1990s. This bound holds for the MDL/CQ containment problem as well. We also show that changes to the conditions given in our special cases can not be eliminated, and that in particular slight variations of the problem of containment under access patterns become 2EXPTIME-complete.},

  abstract = {It follows from known results in the literature that least and greatest fixed-points of monotone polynomials on Heyting algebras—that is, the algebraic models of the Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus—always exist, even when these algebras are not complete as lattices. The reason is that these extremal fixed-points are definable by formulas of the
            IPC
            . Consequently, the μ-calculus based on intuitionistic logic is trivial, every μ-formula being equivalent to a fixed-point free formula. In the first part of this article, we give an axiomatization of least and greatest fixed-points of formulas, and an algorithm to compute a fixed-point free formula equivalent to a given μ-formula. The axiomatization of the greatest fixed-point is simple. The axiomatization of the least fixed-point is more complex, in particular every monotone formula converges to its least fixed-point by Kleene’s iteration in a finite number of steps, but there is no uniform upper bound on the number of iterations. The axiomatization yields a decision procedure for the μ-calculus based on propositional intuitionistic logic. The second part of the article deals with closure ordinals of monotone polynomials on Heyting algebras and of intuitionistic monotone formulas; these are the least numbers of iterations needed for a polynomial/formula to converge to its least fixed-point. Mirroring the elimination procedure, we show how to compute upper bounds for closure ordinals of arbitrary intuitionistic formulas. For some classes of formulas, we provide tighter upper bounds that, in some cases, we prove exact.},

To set up the formal framework, we start with developing a basic reason-maintenance belief logic, present its syntax and semantics, and investigate its axiomatization and properties. Then, we extend the basic logic to accommodate the possibilistic uncertainty of information and beliefs, provide a complete axiomatization of the extended logic, and show that it can address the reason-maintenance issue of partially inconsistent beliefs. We also demonstrate the applicability of our formalisms by using several examples in realistic scenarios.},

We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and—even more so—in practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation and demonstrate that it scales well on real data.

  abstract = {We present new methods for solving the Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem over the theory of Quantifier-Free Non-linear Integer Arithmetic, SMT(QF-NIA), which consists of deciding the satisfiability of ground formulas with integer polynomial constraints. Following previous work, we propose to solve SMT(QF-NIA) instances by reducing them to linear arithmetic: non-linear monomials are linearized by abstracting them with fresh variables and by performing case splitting on integer variables with finite domain. For variables that do not have a finite domain, we can artificially introduce one by imposing a lower and an upper bound and iteratively enlarge it until a solution is found (or the procedure times out).
          The key for the success of the approach is to determine, at each iteration, which domains have to be enlarged. Previously, unsatisfiable cores were used to identify the domains to be changed, but no clue was obtained as to how large the new domains should be. Here, we explain two novel ways to guide this process by analyzing solutions to optimization problems: (i) to minimize the number of violated artificial domain bounds, solved via a Max-SMT solver, and (ii) to minimize the distance with respect to the artificial domains, solved via an Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) solver. Using this SMT-based optimization technology allows smoothly extending the method to also solve Max-SMT problems over non-linear integer arithmetic. Finally, we leverage the resulting Max-SMT(QF-NIA) techniques to solve ∃ ∀ formulas in a fragment of quantified non-linear arithmetic that appears commonly in verification and synthesis applications.},

In particular, many social, industrial, and business information systems require a common basis for a seamless exchange of complex process information. This is, however, inhibited, because different systems may use distinct terminologies or assume different meanings for the same terms. A common solution to this problem is to develop logical theories that act as an intermediate language between different parties. In this article, we characterize a class of activities that can act as intermediate languages between different parties in those cases. We show that for each domain with finite number of elements there exists a class of activities, we called canonical activities, such that all possible changes within the domain can be represented as a sequence of occurrences of those activities. We use an algebraic structure for representing change and characterizing canonical activities, which enables us to abstract away domain-dependent properties of processes and activities, and demonstrate general properties of formalisms required for semantic integration of dynamic information systems.},

These nominal quantifiers called “new” and “wen” are distinct from the self-dual Gabbay-Pitts and Miller-Tiu nominal quantifiers. The novelty of these nominal quantifiers is they are polarised in the sense that “new” distributes over positive operators while “wen” distributes over negative operators. This greater control of bookkeeping enables private names to be modelled in processes embedded as formulae in MAV1. The technical challenge is to establish a cut elimination result from which essential properties including the transitivity of implication follow. Since the system is defined using the calculus of structures, a generalisation of the sequent calculus, novel techniques are employed. The proof relies on an intricately designed multiset-based measure of the size of a proof, which is used to guide a normalisation technique called
            splitting
            . The presence of equivariance, which swaps successive quantifiers, induces complex inter-dependencies between nominal quantifiers, additive conjunction, and multiplicative operators in the proof of splitting. Every rule is justified by an example demonstrating why the rule is necessary for soundly embedding processes and ensuring that cut elimination holds.},

We propose a probabilistic rational temporal logic PRTL*, which extends the probabilistic computation tree logic PCTL* with reasoning about mental attitudes (beliefs, goals, and intentions) and includes novel operators that can express concepts of social trust such as competence, disposition, and dependence.

              N
            
            . By a result of Thiagarajan [46], these unfoldings are exactly the trace-regular event structures. Thiagarajan [46] conjectured that regular event structures correspond exactly to trace-regular event structures. In a recent paper (Chalopin and Chepoi [12]), we disproved this conjecture, based on the striking bijection between domains of event structures, median graphs, and CAT(0) cube complexes. However, we proved that Thiagarajan’s conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains are principal filters of universal covers of finite special cube complexes.
          
          
            In the current article, we prove the converse: To any finite 1-safe Petri net
            N
            , one can associate a finite special cube complex X
            
              N
            
            such that the domain of the event structure E

            (obtained as the unfolding of
            N
            ) is a principal filter of the universal cover X̃
            
              N
            
            of X
            
              N
            
            . This establishes a bijection between 1-safe Petri nets and finite special cube complexes and provides a combinatorial characterization of trace-regular event structures.
          
          
            Using this bijection and techniques from graph theory and geometry (MSO theory of graphs, bounded treewidth, and bounded hyperbolicity), we disprove yet another conjecture by Thiagarajan (from the paper with Yang [48]) that the monadic second-order logic of a 1-safe Petri net (i.e., of its event structure unfolding) is decidable if and only if its unfolding is grid-free. It was proven by Thiagarajan and Yang [48] that the MSO logic is undecidable if the unfolding is not grid-free. Our counterexample is the trace-regular event structure that arises from a virtually special square complex Z. The domain of this event structure
            Ė
            
              Z
            
            is the principal filter of the universal cover Z̃ of Z in which to each vertex we added a pendant edge. The graph of the domain of

              Z

              Z

  abstract = {We consider probabilistic model checking for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) induced from Stochastic Reaction Networks against a fragment of Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) extended with reward operators. Classical numerical algorithms for CSL model checking based on uniformisation are limited to finite CTMCs and suffer from exponential growth of the state space with respect to the number of species. However, approximate techniques such as mean-field approximations and simulations combined with statistical inference are more scalable but can be time-consuming and do not support the full expressiveness of CSL. In this article, we employ a continuous-space approximation of the CTMC in terms of a Gaussian process based on the Central Limit Approximation, also known as the Linear Noise Approximation, whose solution requires solving a number of differential equations that is quadratic in the number of species and independent of the population size. We then develop efficient and scalable approximate model checking algorithms on the resulting Gaussian process, where we restrict the target regions for probabilistic reachability to convex polytopes. This allows us to derive an abstraction in terms of a time-inhomogeneous discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), whose dimension is independent of the number of species, on which model checking is performed. Using results from probability theory, we prove the convergence in distribution of our algorithms to the corresponding measures on the original CTMC. We implement the techniques and, on a set of examples, demonstrate that they allow us to overcome the state space explosion problem, while still correctly characterizing the stochastic behaviour of the system. Our methods can be used for formal analysis of a wide range of distributed stochastic systems, including biochemical systems, sensor networks, and population protocols.},

  abstract = {Some artists peel citrus fruits into a variety of elegant 2D shapes, depicting animals, plants, and cartoons. It is a creative art form, called
            Citrus Peeling Art.
            This art form follows the conservation principle, i.e., each shape must be created using one entire peel. Central to this art is finding optimal cut lines so that the citruses can be cut and unfolded into the desired shapes. However, it is extremely difficult for users to imagine and generate cuts for their desired shapes. To this end, we present a computational method for citrus peeling art designs. Our key insight is that instead of solving the difficult cut generation problem, we map a designed input shape onto a citrus in an attempt to cover the entire citrus and use the mapped boundary to generate the cut paths. Sometimes, a mapped shape is unable to completely cover a citrus. Consequently, we have developed five customized ways of interaction that are used to rectify the input shape so that it is suitable for citrus peeling art. The mapping process and user interactions are iteratively conducted to satisfy a user's design intentions. A large number of experiments, including a formative user study, demonstrate the capability and practicability of our method for peeling art design and construction.},

  abstract = {We present an inverse design tool for fabric formwork - a process where flat panels are sewn together to form a fabric container for casting a plaster sculpture. Compared to 3D printing techniques, the benefit of fabric formwork is its properties of low-cost and easy transport. The process of fabric formwork is akin to molding and casting but having a soft boundary. Deformation of the fabric container is governed by force equilibrium between the pressure forces from liquid fill and tension in the stretched fabric. The final result of fabrication depends on the shapes of the flat panels, the fabrication orientation and the placement of external supports. Our computational framework generates optimized flat panels and fabrication orientation with reference to a target shape, and determines effective locations for external supports. We demonstrate the function of this design tool on a variety of models with different shapes and topology. Physical fabrication is also demonstrated to validate our approach.},

  abstract = {Hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) combine advantages of multicopters and fixed-wing planes: vertical take-off, landing, and low energy use. However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs (Figure 1, 8). The experiments show that the controller is robust to exploit the complex dynamics when both rotors and wings are active in flight tests.},

The results of this article have a significant impact on several fields, including scalable distributed systems, resilient and self-

            systems, and verification of parameterized systems. First, we identify necessary and sufficient local conditions for the existence of global livelocks in parameterized unidirectional rings with unbounded (but finite) number of processes under the interleaving semantics. Using a reduction from the periodic domino problem, we show that, in general, verifying livelock-freedom of parameterized unidirectional rings is undecidable (specifically, Π
            1
            0
            -complete) even for constant space, deterministic, and self-disabling processes. This result implies that verifying self-stabilization for parameterized rings of self-disabling processes is also undecidable. We also show that verifying livelock-freedom and self-stabilization remain undecidable under (1) synchronous execution semantics, (2) the FIFO consistency model, and (3) any scheduling policy. We then present a new scope-based method for detecting and constructing livelocks in parameterized rings. The proposed semi-algorithm behind our scope-based verification is based on a novel paradigm for the detection of livelocks that totally circumvents state space exploration. Our experimental results on an implementation of the proposed semi-algorithm are very promising as we have found livelocks in parameterized rings in a few microseconds on a regular laptop. The results of this article have significant implications for scalable distributed systems with cyclic topologies.},

  abstract = {Branch decomposition is a prominent method for structurally decomposing a graph, a hypergraph, or a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form. The width of a branch decomposition provides a measure of how well the object is decomposed. For many applications, it is crucial to computing a branch decomposition whose width is as small as possible. We propose an approach based on Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) to finding branch decompositions of small width. The core of our approach is an efficient SAT encoding that determines with a single SAT-call whether a given hypergraph admits a branch decomposition of a certain width. For our encoding, we propose a natural partition-based characterization of branch decompositions. The encoding size imposes a limit on the size of the given hypergraph. To break through this barrier and to scale the SAT approach to larger instances, we develop a new heuristic approach where the SAT encoding is used to locally improve a given candidate decomposition until a fixed-point is reached. This new SAT-based local improvement method scales now to instances with several thousands of vertices and edges.},

To utilize this fact, two substantial gaps have to be addressed: (i) What makes a sequent calculus analytic? and (ii) How do we obtain an efficient decision procedure for derivability in an analytic calculus? In the first part of this article, we answer these questions for
            pure calculi
            —a general family of fully structural propositional sequent calculi whose rules allow arbitrary context formulas. We provide a sufficient syntactic criterion for analyticity in these calculi, as well as a productive method to construct new analytic calculi from given ones. We further introduce a scalable decision procedure for derivability in analytic pure calculi by showing that it can be (uniformly) reduced to classical satisfiability. In the second part of the article, we study the extension of pure sequent calculi with modal operators. We show that such extensions preserve the analyticity of the calculus and identify certain restricted operators (which we call “Next” operators) that are also amenable for a general reduction of derivability to classical satisfiability. Our proofs are all semantic, utilizing several strong general soundness and completeness theorems with respect to non-deterministic semantic frameworks: bivaluations (for pure calculi) and Kripke models (for their extension with modal operators).},

  abstract = {We examine sequential equilibrium in the context ofcomputational games(Halpern and Pass 2015), where agents are charged for computation. In such games, an agent can rationally choose to forget, so issues of imperfect recall arise. In this setting, we consider two notions of sequential equilibrium. One is anex antenotion, where a player chooses his strategy before the game starts and is committed to it, but chooses it in such a way that it remains optimal even off the equilibrium path. The second is aninterimnotion, where a player can reconsider at each information set whether he is doing the “right” thing, and if not, can change his strategy. The two notions agree in games of perfect recall, but not in games of imperfect recall. Although the interim notion seems more appealing, in a companion article (Halpern and Pass 2016), we argue that there are some deep conceptual problems with it in standard games of imperfect recall. We show that the conceptual problems largely disappear in the computational setting. Moreover, in this setting, under natural assumptions, the two notions coincide.},

We give an effective logical characterisation of the reachability relation of timed-register pushdown automata. As a corollary, we obtain a doubly exponential time procedure for the non-emptiness problem. We show that the complexity reduces to singly exponential under the assumption of monotonic time. The proofs involve a novel model of one-dimensional integer branching vector addition systems with states. As a result interesting on its own, we show that reachability sets of the latter model are semilinear and computable in exponential time.},

This work studies the use of everyday fabrics as a flexible and soft sensing medium to monitor joint angular motion accurately and reliably. Specifically we focus on the primary use of conductive stretchable fabrics to sense the skin deformation during joint motion and infer the joint rotational angle. We tackle challenges of fabric sensing originated by the inherent properties of elastic materials by leveraging two types of sensing fabric and characterizing their properties based on models in material science. We apply models from bio-mechanics to infer joint angles and propose the use of dual strain sensing to enhance sensing robustness against user diversity and fabric position offsets. We fabricate prototypes using off-the-shelf fabrics and micro-controller. Experiments with ten participants show 9.69° median angular error in tracking joint angle and its sensing robustness across various users and activities.},

Automatic systems are increasingly needed to help users navigate through the growing amount of visual information available, either on the web or our personal devices, for instance by selecting relevant and interesting content. Previous studies indicate that visual interest is highly related to concepts like arousal, unusualness, or complexity, where these connections are found based on psychological theories, user studies, or computational approaches. However, the link between visual interestingness and other related concepts has been only partially explored so far, for example, by considering only a limited subset of covariates at a time.

Owing to their high expressiveness, such rules make the evaluation of queries undecidable, even when the latter are atomic. Decidable generalizations of Datalog by existential rules have been proposed in the literature (such as weakly acyclic and weakly guarded); but they pay the price of higher computational complexity, hindering the implementation of effective systems. Conversely, the results in this article demonstrate that it is definitely possible to enable fast yet powerful query answering over existential rules that strictly generalize Datalog by ensuring decidability without any complexity overhead. On the theoretical side, we define the class of parsimonious programs that guarantees decidability of atomic queries. We then strengthen this class to strongly parsimonious programs ensuring decidability also for conjunctive queries. Since parsimony is an undecidable property, we single out Shy, an easily recognizable class of strongly parsimonious programs that generalizes Datalog while preserving its complexity even under conjunctive queries. Shy also generalizes the class of linear existential programs, while it is uncomparable to the other main classes ensuring decidability. On the practical side, we exploit our results to implement DLV

Using a sequential SVM-HMM model, we model conversation flow, predicting the dialogue act of a given turn in real time, and showcase this using our “PredDial” portal. We characterize differences between customer and agent behavior in Twitter customer service conversations and investigate the effect of testing our system on different customer service industries. Finally, we use a data-driven approach to predict important conversation outcomes: customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and overall problem resolution. We show that the type and location of certain dialogue acts in a conversation have a significant effect on the probability of desirable and undesirable outcomes and present actionable rules based on our findings. We explore the correlations between different dialogue acts and the outcome of the conversations in detail using an actionable-rule discovery task by leveraging a state-of-the-art sequential rule mining algorithm while modeling a set of conversations as a set of sequences.

  abstract = {In alternating-time temporal logic ATL*, agents with perfect recall assign choices to sequences of states, i.e., to possible finite histories of the game. However, when a nested strategic modality is interpreted, the new strategy does not take into account the previous sequence of events. It is as if agents collect their observations in the nested game again from scratch, thus, effectively forgetting what they observed before. Intuitively, it does not fit the assumption of agents having perfect recall of the past. In this article, we investigate the alternative semantics for ATL*where the past is not forgotten in nested games. We show that the standard semantics of ATL*coincides with the “truly perfect recall” semantics for agents with perfect information and in case of so-called “objective” abilities under uncertainty. On the other hand, the two semantics differ significantly for the most popular (“subjective”) notion of ability under imperfect information. The same applies to the standard vs. “truly perfect recall” semantics of ATL*with persistent strategies. We compare the relevant variants of ATL*by looking at their expressive power, sets of validities, and tractability of model checking.},

One distinction is between symbolic, spatial and connectionist representations. The other is between descriptive and procedural representations. Additionally, conceptual representations used in particular creative domains, such as language, music, image and emotion, are reviewed separately. For every representation reviewed, we cover the inference it affords, the computational means of building it, and its application in concept creation.},

The resulting systems are modular and have separate left and right introduction rules for the modalities, which makes them amenable to specification as bipole clauses. While this granulation of the sequent rules introduces more choices for proof search, we show how linear nested sequent calculi can be restricted to blocked derivations, which directly correspond to ordinary sequent derivations.},

The communication is developed as a result of neural responses generated in the brain because of motor movements or cognitive activities. The means of communication here includes muscular and non-muscular actions. These actions generate brain activities or brain waves that are directed to a hardware device to perform a specific task. BCI initially was developed as the communication device for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Owing to recent advancements in BCI devices—such as passive electrodes, wireless headsets, adaptive software, and decreased costs—it is also being used for developing communication between the general public. The BCI device records brain responses using various invasive and non-invasive acquisition techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article, a survey on these techniques has been provided. The brain response needs to be translated using machine learning and pattern recognition methods to control any application. A brief review of various existing feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms applied on data recorded from the brain has been included in this article. A significant comparative analysis of popular existing BCI techniques is presented and possible future directives are provided.},

In this paper I will comment on the thoughtful rejoinders from Burton-Jones, Gregor, and Myers.

Although the ROBDD is a lightweight data structure to implement, the behavior, in terms of memory allocation, may not be obvious to the program architect. We explore experimentally, numerically, and theoretically the typical and worst-case ROBDD sizes in terms of number of nodes and residual compression ratios, as compared to unreduced BDDs. While our theoretical results are not surprising, as they are in keeping with previously known results, we believe our method contributes to the current body of research by our experimental and statistical treatment of ROBDD sizes. In addition, we provide an algorithm to calculate the worst-case size. Finally, we present an algorithm for constructing a worst-case ROBDD of a given number of variables.

BRD also emphasizes using simplified fabrication tools, media and coding platforms, and microcontrollers common in youth content creation communities and makerspaces. This study provides a framework to analyze computational concepts, practices, and perspectives that leverage an integrated systems and multimodal learning approach, such as BRD, adding to, building on, and integrating previous analytic approaches to looking at Scratch coding, media design, physical computing and e-textiles. Using a detailed case study of one team during one of the early workshop iterations, we conduct a multimodal analysis of bidirectionally responsive making activities and discuss the ways that they present novel understanding of integrating diverse interests and encouraging collaborative and distributed computational thinking. We further examine how BRD operationalizes and extends multimodal learning theory by adding tangible and integrative dimensions as additional modalities learners can leverage to facilitate meaning making, metacognition, and agency. We also discuss how designing integrated systems, as facilitated through BRD, provides an opportunity to engage in authentic practices around the design of complex systems.},

  abstract = {The complexity of large-scale distributed systems, particularly when deployed in physical space, calls for new mechanisms to address composability and reusability of collective adaptive behaviour. Computational fields have been proposed as an effective abstraction to fill the gap between the macro-level of such systems (specifying a system’s collective behaviour) and the micro-level (individual devices’ actions of computation and interaction to implement that collective specification), thereby providing a basis to better facilitate the engineering of collective APIs and complex systems at higher levels of abstraction. This article proposes a full formal foundation for field computations, in terms of a core (higher-order) calculus of computational fields containing a few key syntactic constructs, and equipped with typing, denotational and operational semantics. Critically, this allows formal establishment of a link between the micro- and macro-levels of collective adaptive systems by a result of computational adequacy and abstraction for the (aggregate) denotational semantics with respect to the (per-device) operational semantics.},

In this article, we aim to automate the process of selecting an appropriate DNN topology that fulfills both functional and non-functional requirements of the application. Specifically, we focus on tuning two important hyperparameters, depth and width, which together define the shape of the resulting network and directly affect its accuracy, speed, size, and energy consumption. To reduce the time needed to search the design space, we train a fraction of DNNs and build a model to predict the performances of the remaining ones.

  abstract = {In recent years, model checking with interval temporal logics is emerging as a viable alternative to model checking with standard point-based temporal logics, such as LTL, CTL, CTL*, and the like. The behavior of the system is modeled by means of (finite) Kripke structures, as usual. However, while temporal logics which are interpreted “point-wise” describe how the system evolves state-by-state, and predicate properties of system states, those which are interpreted “interval-wise” express properties of computation stretches, spanning a sequence of states. A proposition letter is assumed to hold over a computation stretch (interval) if and only if it holds over each component state (homogeneity assumption). A natural question arises: is there any advantage in replacing points by intervals as the primary temporal entities, or is it just a matter of taste?
          In this article, we study the expressiveness of Halpern and Shoham’s interval temporal logic (HS) in model checking, in comparison with those of LTL, CTL, and CTL*. To this end, we consider three semantic variants of HS: the state-based one, introduced by Montanari et al. in [30, 34], that allows time to branch both in the past and in the future, the computation-tree-based one, that allows time to branch in the future only, and the trace-based variant, that disallows time to branch. These variants are compared among themselves and to the aforementioned standard logics, getting a complete picture. In particular, we show that HS with trace-based semantics is equivalent to LTL (but at least exponentially more succinct), HS with computation-tree-based semantics is equivalent to finitary CTL*, and HS with state-based semantics is incomparable with all of them (LTL, CTL, and CTL*).},

We show that, for the most studied propositional, algebraic, and semialgebraic proof systems, the classical constructions of pp-interpretability, homomorphic equivalence, and addition of constants to a core preserve the proof complexity of the CSP. As a result, for those proof systems, the classes of constraint languages for which small unsatisfiability certificates exist can be characterized algebraically. We illustrate our results by a gap theorem saying that a constraint language either has resolution refutations of constant width or does not have bounded-depth Frege refutations of subexponential size. The former holds exactly for the widely studied class of constraint languages of bounded width. This class is also known to coincide with the class of languages with refutations of sublinear degree in Sums of Squares and Polynomial Calculus over the real field, for which we provide alternative proofs. We then ask for the existence of a natural proof system with good behavior with respect to reductions and simultaneously small-size refutations beyond bounded width. We give an example of such a proof system by showing that bounded-degree Lovász-Schrijver satisfies both requirements. Finally, building on the known lower bounds, we demonstrate the applicability of the method of reducibilities and construct new explicit hard instances of the graph three-coloring problem for all studied proof systems.},

Unlike a previous algebraic approach of Metcalfe and Röthlisberger, which is feasible only when the relevant free algebra is not too large, this method exploits natural dualities for quasivarieties to work with structures of smaller cardinality and surjective rather than injective morphisms. A number of case studies are described here that could not be be solved using the algebraic approach, including (quasi)varieties of MS-algebras, double Stone algebras, and involutive Stone algebras.},

  abstract = {Addressing vergence-accommodation conflict in head-mounted displays (HMDs) requires resolving two interrelated problems. First, the hardware must support viewing sharp imagery over the full accommodation range of the user. Second, HMDs should accurately reproduce retinal defocus blur to correctly drive accommodation. A multitude of
            accommodation-supporting
            HMDs have been proposed, with three architectures receiving particular attention: varifocal, multifocal, and light field displays. These designs all extend depth of focus, but rely on computationally expensive rendering and optimization algorithms to reproduce accurate defocus blur (often limiting content complexity and interactive applications). To date, no unified framework has been proposed to support driving these emerging HMDs using commodity content. In this paper, we introduce
            DeepFocus
            , a generic, end-to-end convolutional neural network designed to efficiently solve the full range of computational tasks for accommodation-supporting HMDs. This network is demonstrated to accurately synthesize defocus blur, focal stacks, multilayer decompositions, and multiview imagery using only commonly available RGB-D images, enabling real-time, near-correct depictions of retinal blur with a broad set of accommodation-supporting HMDs.},

After recapitulating the major underlying concepts, a new integrated review and analysis scheme for reputation and trust models is put forward. Using highly recognized review papers in this domain as a basis, this article will also introduce additional evaluation metrics to account for characteristics so far unstudied. A subsequent application of the new review schema on 40 top recent publications in this scientific field revealed interesting insights. While the area of computational trust and reputation models is still a very active research branch, the analysis carried out here was able to show that some aspects have already started to converge, whereas others are still subject to vivid discussions.},

Yet, as notebooks evolve and grow they often become difficult to navigate or understand, discouraging sharing and reuse. We present the design and evaluation of a Jupyter Notebook extension providing facilities for annotated cell folding. Through a lab study and multi-week deployment we find cell folding aids notebook navigation and comprehension, not only by the original author, but also by collaborators viewing the notebook in a meeting or revising it on their own. However, in some cases cell folding encouraged collaborators to overlook folded sections or spend longer reviewing a notebook before editing it. These findings extend our understanding of code folding's trade-offs to a new medium and demonstrate its benefits for everyday collaboration. We conclude by discussing how dynamic reorganization can support sharing and reuse of computational notebooks.},

Prior work has developed systems for improving collective ideation and design by exposing people to each others' ideas and encouraging them to intermix those ideas. However, organizational behavior research has demonstrated that intermixing ideas does not result in meaningful engagement with those ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility.},

Mapping this fully connected system to current generation neuromorphic hardware is done by embedding sparse tree graphs to generate only the leading-order spiking dynamics. We demonstrate that for a chosen set of benchmark graphs, the spike responses generated on a current generation neuromorphic processor can improve the stability of graph partitions and non-overlapping communities can be identified even with the loss of higher-order spiking behavior if the graphs are sufficiently dense. For sparse graphs, the loss of higher-order spiking behavior improves the stability of certain graph partitions but does not retrieve the known community memberships.},

  abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a Geometry of Interaction (GoI) interpretation inspired from Hughes--Van Glabbeek (HvG) proof-nets for multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL). Our GoI dynamically captures HvG’s geometric correctness criterion—the toggling cycle condition—in terms of algebraic operators. Our new ingredient is a scalar extension of the *-algebra in Girard’s *-ring of partial isometries over a Boolean polynomial ring with literals of eigenweights as indeterminates. To capture feedback arising from cuts, we construct a finer-grained execution formula. The expansion of this execution formula is longer than that for collections of slices for multiplicative GoI, hence it is harder to prove termination. Our GoI gives a dynamical, semantical account of Boolean valuations (in particular, pruning sub-proofs), conversion of weights (in particular, α-conversion), and additive (co)contraction, peculiar to additive proof-theory. Termination of our execution formula is shown to correspond to HvG’s toggling criterion. The slice-wise restriction of our execution formula (by collapsing the Boolean structure) yields the well-known correspondence, explicit or implicit in previous works on multiplicative GoI, between the convergence of execution formulas and acyclicity of proof-nets. Feedback arising from the execution formula by restricting to the Boolean polynomial structure yields autonomous definability of eigenweights among cuts from the rest of the eigenweights.},

Maybe surprisingly, we see that the former covers most of the algorithm, including the most difficult details. Thus, we can easily instantiate our algorithm with rule sets for several important language features including, e.g., dependent function types. Moreover, our design is modular such that we obtain a type reconstruction algorithm for any combination of these features.},

            parallel cost analysis

            , parallel cost captures the cost of synchronized tasks executing in parallel by exploiting the true concurrency available in the execution model of distributed processing. True concurrency is challenging for static cost analysis, because the parallelism between tasks needs to be soundly inferred, and the waiting and idle processor times at the different locations need to be accounted for. Parallel cost analysis works in three phases: (1) it performs a
            block-level
            analysis to estimate the serial costs of the blocks between synchronization points in the program; (2) it then constructs a
            distributed flow graph
            (DFG) to capture the parallelism, the waiting, and idle times at the locations of the distributed system; and (3) the parallel cost can finally be obtained as the
            path of maximal cost
            in the DFG. We prove the correctness of the proposed parallel cost analysis, and provide a prototype implementation to perform an experimental evaluation of the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed analysis.},

Several research domains such as information retrieval have long relied on systematic evaluation to measure progress: here, the Cranfield paradigm of creating shared test collections, defining search tasks, and collecting ground truth for these tasks has persisted up until now. In recent years, however, several new challenges have emerged that do not fit this paradigm very well: extremely large data sets, confidential data sets as found in the medical domain, and rapidly changing data sets as often encountered in industry. Crowdsourcing has also changed the way in which industry approaches problem-solving with companies now organizing challenges and handing out monetary awards to incentivize people to work on their challenges, particularly in the field of machine learning.
          This article is based on discussions at a workshop on Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS). EaaS is the paradigm of not providing data sets to participants and have them work on the data locally, but keeping the data central and allowing access via Application Programming Interfaces (API), Virtual Machines (VM), or other possibilities to ship executables. The objectives of this article are to summarize and compare the current approaches and consolidate the experiences of these approaches to outline the next steps of EaaS, particularly toward sustainable research infrastructures.
          The article summarizes several existing approaches to EaaS and analyzes their usage scenarios and also the advantages and disadvantages. The many factors influencing EaaS are summarized, and the environment in terms of motivations for the various stakeholders, from funding agencies to challenge organizers, researchers and participants, to industry interested in supplying real-world problems for which they require solutions.
          EaaS solves many problems of the current research environment, where data sets are often not accessible to many researchers. Executables of published tools are equally often not available making the reproducibility of results impossible. EaaS, however, creates reusable/citable data sets as well as available executables. Many challenges remain, but such a framework for research can also foster more collaboration between researchers, potentially increasing the speed of obtaining research results.},

FEP constructs are constraints, expressed over one or more shots from a movie sequence, that characterize changes in cinematographic visual properties, such as shot sizes, camera angles, or layout of actors on the screen. We present the vocabulary of the FEP language, introduce its usage in analyzing styles from annotated film data, and describe how it can support users in the creative design of film sequences in 3D. More specifically, (i) we define the FEP language, (ii) we present an application to craft filmic sequences from 3D animated scenes that uses FEPs as a high level mean to select cameras and perform cuts between cameras that follow best practices in cinema, and (iii) we evaluate the benefits of FEPs by performing user experiments in which professional filmmakers and amateurs had to create cinematographic sequences. The evaluation suggests that users generally appreciate the idea of FEPs, and that it can effectively help novice and medium experienced users in crafting film sequences with little training.},

  abstract = {In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students’ knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review
            on the reviewers
            , and the results this has on the students’ learning.
          
          To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students’ conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students’ level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts.},

  abstract = {We introduce several versions of game-theoretic semantics (GTS) for Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL). In GTS, truth is defined in terms of existence of a winning strategy in a semantic evaluation game. Thus, the game-theoretic perspective appears in the framework of ATL on two semantic levels: on the object level in the standard semantics of the strategic operators and on the meta-level, where game-theoretic logical semantics is applied to ATL. We unify these two perspectives into semantic evaluation games specially designed for ATL. The game-theoretic perspective enables us to identify new variants of the semantics of ATL based on limiting the time resources available to the verifier and falsifier in the semantic evaluation game. We introduce and analyze an
            unbounded
            and
            (ordinal) bounded
            GTS and prove these to be equivalent to the standard (Tarski-style) compositional semantics. We show that, in bounded GTS, truth of ATL formulae can always be determined in finite time, that is, without constructing infinite paths. We also introduce a nonequivalent
            finitely bounded
            semantics and argue that it is natural from both logical and game-theoretic perspectives.},

  abstract = {Computational psychology has the aim to explain human cognition by computational models of cognitive processes. The cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought--Rational (ACT-R) is popular to develop such models. Although ACT-R has a well-defined psychological theory and has been used to explain many cognitive processes, there are two problems that make it hard to reason formally about its cognitive models: First, ACT-R lacks a computational formalization of its underlying production rule system, and, second, there are many different implementations and extensions of ACT-R with many technical artifacts complicating formal reasoning even more.
          
            This article describes a formal operational semantics—the
            very abstract semantics
            —that abstracts from as many technical details as possible, keeping it open to extensions and different implementations of the ACT-R theory. In a second step, this semantics is refined to define some of its abstract features that are found in many implementations of ACT-R—called the
            abstract semantics
            . It concentrates on the procedural core of ACT-R and is suitable for analysis of the general transition system, since it still abstracts from details like timing, the sub-symbolic layer of ACT-R or conflict resolution.
          
          Furthermore, a translation of ACT-R models to the declarative programming language Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is defined. This makes the abstract semantics an executable specification of ACT-R. CHR has been used successfully to embed other rule-based formalisms like graph transformation systems or functional programming. There are many theoretical results and practical tools that support formal reasoning about and analysis of CHR programs. The translation of ACT-R models to CHR is proven sound and complete w.r.t. the abstract operational semantics of ACT-R. This paves the way to analysis of ACT-R models through CHR analysis results and tools. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, our abstract semantics is the first abstract formulation of ACT-R suitable for both analysis and execution.},

We show that adding binary relations over finite paths in the picture may alter the situation. We consider a general setting where finite paths of transition systems are linked by means of a fixed binary relation. This setting gives rise to natural extensions of MSO and the mu-calculus, that we call the MSOwith paths relationand thejumping mu-calculus, the expressivities of which we aim at comparing. We first show that “bounded-memory” binary relations bring about no additional expressivity to either of the two logics, and thus preserve expressive completeness. In contrast, we show that for a natural, classic “infinite-memory” binary relation stemming from games with imperfect information, the existence of a winning strategy in such games, though expressible in the bisimulation-invariant fragment of MSO with paths relation, cannot be expressed in the jumping mu-calculus. Expressive completeness thus fails for this relation. These results crucially rely on our observation that the jumping mu-calculus has a tree automata counterpart: thejumping tree automata, hence the name of the jumping mu-calculus. We also prove that forobservablewinning conditions, the existence of winning strategies in games with imperfect information is expressible in the jumping mu-calculus. Finally, we derive from our main theorem that jumping automata cannot be projected, and ATL with imperfect information does not admit expansion laws.},

The idea is to abstract nonlinear multiplication and transcendental functions as uninterpreted functions in an abstract space limited to linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions. The uninterpreted functions are incrementally axiomatized by means of upper- and lower-bounding piecewise-linear constraints. In the case of transcendental functions, particular care is required to ensure the soundness of the abstraction.

          In this work, we explore the use of additive manufacturing for generating structural colors, where the structures are designed using a fabrication-aware optimization process. This requires a combination of full-wave simulation, a feasible parameterization of the design space, and a tailored optimization procedure. Many of these components should be re-usable for the design of other optical structures at this scale.
          We show initial results of material samples fabricated based on our designs. While these suffer from the prototype character of state-of-the-art fabrication hardware, we believe they clearly demonstrate the potential of additive nanofabrication for structural colors and other graphics applications.},

The first, if taken to mean that in Feyerabend's spirit of anarchy there should be ongoing questioning of our epistemological foundations, is worth supporting for a number of reasons, including the apparent hegemony of hypothetico-deductive type perspectives.

  abstract = {Systems neuroscience studies involving in-vivo models often require realtime data processing. In these studies, many events must be monitored and processed quickly, including behavior of the subject (e.g., movement of a limb) or features of neural data (e.g., a neuron transmitting an action potential). Unfortunately, most realtime platforms are proprietary, require specific architectures, or are limited to low-level programming languages. Here we present a hardware-independent, open-source realtime computation platform that supports high-level programming. The resulting platform, LiCoRICE, can process on order 10e10 bits/sec of network data at 1 ms ticks with 18.2 µs jitter. It connects to various inputs and outputs (e.g., DIO, Ethernet, database logging, and analog line in/out) and minimizes reliance on custom device drivers by leveraging peripheral support via the Linux kernel. Its modular architecture supports model-based design for rapid prototyping with C and Python/Cython and can perform numerical operations via BLAS/LAPACK-optimized NumPy that is statically compiled via Numba’s pycc. LiCoRICE is not only suitable for systems neuroscience research, but also for applications requiring closed-loop realtime data processing from robotics and control systems to interactive applications and quantitative financial trading.},

  abstract = {Exact solving of systems of linear equations (SLEs) is a fundamental subroutine within number theory, formal verification of mathematical proofs, and exact-precision mathematical programming. Moreover, efficient exact SLE solution methods could be valuable for a growing body of science and engineering applications where current fixed-precision standards have been deemed inadequate. This article contains key derivations relating, and computational tests comparing, two exact direct solution frameworks: roundoff-error-free (REF) LU factorization and rational arithmetic LU factorization. Specifically, both approaches solve the linear system
            Ax
            =
            b
            by factoring the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular (L) and upper triangular (U) matrix,
            A
            =
            LU
            . Most significantly, the featured findings reveal that the integer-preserving REF factorization framework solves dense SLEs one order of magnitude faster than the exact rational arithmetic approach while requiring half the memory. Since rational LU is utilized for basic solution validation in exact linear and mixed-integer programming, these results offer preliminary evidence of the potential of the REF factorization framework to be utilized within this specific context. Additionally, this article develops and analyzes an efficient streamlined version of Edmonds’s Q-matrix approach that can be implemented as another basic solution validation approach. Further experiments demonstrate that the REF factorization framework also outperforms this alternative integer-preserving approach in terms of memory requirements and computational effort. General purpose codes to solve dense SLEs exactly via any of the aforementioned methods have been made available to the research and academic communities.},

            modular analysis and unified derivatives
            (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

This involves showing that the syntactic category associated to a type theory with weak identity types carries the structure of a path category, strengthening earlier results by Avigad, Lumsdaine, and Kapulkin. In this way, we not only relate a well-known concept in homotopy theory with a natural concept in logic but also provide a framework for further developments.},

  abstract = {Recent methods have adapted the well-established AGM and belief base frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
          We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which allow us to define syntax-preserving operators for satisfying preservation and support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones, but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
          To evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our operators. We further compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and generalise the other method.},

We develop a theory of single-point refutable specifications that facilitate generating concrete counterexamples using constraint solvers. We implement the framework for synthesizing piece-wise functions in linear integer arithmetic, combining leaf expression synthesis using constraint-solving with predicate synthesis using enumeration, and tie them together using a decision tree classifier. We demonstrate that this compositional approach is competitive compared to existing synthesis engines on a set of synthesis specifications.},

These models are based on the map-reduce paradigm where the input is transformed into a dataset of key-value pairs, and on each key a local computation is performed on the values associated with that key resulting in another set of key-value pairs. Computation proceeds in a constant number of rounds, where the result of the last round is the input to the next round, and transformation of key-value pairs is required to be generic. The difference between the three models is in the local computation part. In DSAs it is limited to making one pass over its input using a register automaton, while in DSTs it can make two passes: in the first pass it uses a finite state automaton and in the second it uses a register transducer. The third model DSTJs is an extension of DSTs, where local computations are capable of constructing the Cartesian product of two sets. We obtain the following results: (1) DSAs can evaluate first-order queries over bounded degree databases; (2) DSTs can evaluate semijoin algebra queries over arbitrary databases; (3) DSTJs can evaluate the whole relational algebra over arbitrary databases; (4) DSTJs are strictly stronger than DSTs, which in turn are strictly stronger than DSAs; (5) within DSAs, DSTs, and DSTJs, there is a strict hierarchy w.r.t. the number of rounds.},

            (PASLs), extend the logic of (Boolean) Bunched Implications (BBI) in various ways. In particular, these logics contain the connectives * and –*, denoting the composition and extension of resources, respectively.
          
          This added expressive power comes at a price, since the resulting logics are all undecidable. Given their wide applicability, even a semi-decision procedure for these logics is desirable. Although several PASLs and their relationships with BBI are discussed in the literature, the proof theory of, and automated reasoning for, these logics were open problems solved by the conference version of this article, which developed a modular proof theory for various PASLs using cut-free labelled sequent calculi. This paper non-trivially improves upon this previous work by giving a general framework of calculi on which any new axiom in the logic satisfying a certain form corresponds to an inference rule in our framework, and the completeness proof is generalised to consider such axioms.
          Our base calculus handles Calcagno et al.’s original logic of separation algebras by adding sound rules for partial-determinism and cancellativity, while preserving cut-elimination. We then show that many important properties in separation logic, such as indivisible unit, disjointness, splittability, and cross-split, can be expressed in our general axiom form. Thus, our framework offers inference rules and completeness for these properties for free. Finally, we show how our calculi reduce to calculi with global label substitutions, enabling more efficient implementation.},

  abstract = {Most current information systems security theories assume a rational actor making deliberate decisions, yet recent research in psychology suggests that such deliberate thinking is not as common as we would expect. Much of human behavior is controlled by nonconscious automatic cognition (called System 1 cognition). The deliberate rational cognition of System 2 is triggered when System 1 detects something that is not normal; otherwise we often operate on autopilot. When we do engage System 2 cognition, it is influenced by the System 1 cognition that preceded it. In this paper we present an alternative theoretical approach to information security that is based on the nonconscious automatic cognition of System 1. In a System 1 world, cognition is a sub-second process of pattern-matching a stimulus to an existing person-context heuristic. These person-context heuristics are influenced by personality characteristics and a lifetime of experiences in the context. Thus System 1 theories are closely tied to individuals and the specific security context of interest. Methods to improve security compliance take on a very new form; the traditional approaches to security education and training that provide guidelines and ways to think about security have no effect when behavior is controlled by System 1, because System 1 cognition is instant pattern matching not deliberative. Thus in a System 1 world, we improve security by changing the heuristics used by System 1's pattern matching and/or by changing what System 1 sees as "normal" so that it triggers the deliberate cognition of System 2. In this article, we examine System 1 and System 2 cognition, while calling for increased research to develop theories of System 1 cognition in the cybersecurity literature.},

          Here we propose a graph-theoretic model of tasks and goals, in which dependencies among actions are represented by a directed graph, and a time-inconsistent agent constructs a path through this graph. We first show how instances of this path-finding problem on different input graphs can reconstruct a wide range of qualitative phenomena observed in the literature on time-inconsistency, including procrastination, abandonment of long-range tasks, and the benefits of reduced sets of choices. We then explore a set of analyses that quantify over the set of all graphs; among other results, we find that in any graph, there can be only polynomially many distinct forms of time-inconsistent behavior; and any graph in which a time-inconsistent agent incurs significantly more cost than an optimal agent must contain a large "procrastination" structure as a minor. Finally, we use this graph-theoretic model to explore ways in which tasks can be designed to motivate agents to reach designated goals.},

  abstract = {Everything changes over time. Societies evolve, original technologies emerge, and the structure of products shifts to meet the needs of new situations. What constitutes a usable design will similarly change over time. For these reasons, it's important to regularly stop and assess where a field is and what it is doing to determine how well its activities reflect the context in which it exists. Usability and user experience design are no different. This issue of

  abstract = {Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is one of the most promising candidates in the search for a logic capturing P
            time
            . The question whether there is a logic that expresses exactly the polynomial-time computable properties of finite structures, which has been open for more than 30 years, is one of the most important and challenging problems in finite model theory.
          
          
            The strength of Choiceless Polynomial Time is its ability to perform isomorphism-invariant
            computations
            over structures, using hereditarily finite sets as data structures. But, because of isomorphism-invariance, it is choiceless in the sense that it cannot select an arbitrary element of a set—an operation that is crucial for many classical algorithms. CPT can define many interesting P
            time
            queries, including (a certain version of) the Cai-Fürer-Immerman (CFI) query. The CFI-query is particularly interesting, because it separates fixed-point logic with counting from P
            time
            and has since remained the main benchmark for the expressibility of logics within P
            time
            .
          
          The CFI-construction associates with each connected graph a set of CFI-graphs that can be partitioned into exactly two isomorphism classes called odd and even CFI-graphs. The problem is to decide, given a CFI-graph, whether it is odd or even. For the case where the CFI-graphs arise from ordered graphs, Dawar, Richerby, and Rossman proved that the CFI-query is CPT-definable. However, definability of the CFI-query over general graphs remains open.
          Our first contribution generalises the result by Dawar, Richerby, and Rossman to the variant of the CFI-query derived from graphs with colour classes of logarithmic size, instead of colour class size one. Second, we consider the CFI-query over graph classes where the maximal degree is linear in the size of the graphs. For the latter, we establish CPT-definability using only sets of small, constant rank, which is known to be impossible for the general case.
          In our CFI-recognising procedures we strongly make use of the ability of CPT to create sets, rather than tuples only, and we further prove that, if CPT worked over tuples instead, then no such procedure would be definable. We introduce a notion of “sequencelike objects” based on the structure of the graphs’ symmetry groups, and we show that no CPT-program that only uses sequencelike objects can decide the CFI-query over complete graphs, which have linear maximal degree. From a broader perspective, this generalises a result by Blass, Gurevich, and van den Bussche about the power of isomorphism-invariant machine models (for polynomial time) to a setting with counting.},

This article introduces a number of type systems for nominal terms of increasing sophistication and demonstrates their application in the areas of rewriting and equational reasoning. Two simple type systems inspired by Church’s simply typed lambda calculus are presented where only well-typed terms are considered to exist, over which α-equivalence is then axiomatised. The first requires atoms to be strictly annotated whilst the second explores the consequences of a more relaxed de Bruijn-style approach in the presence of atom-capturing substitution. A final type system of richer ML-like polymorphic types is then given in the style of Curry, in which elements of the term language are deemed typeable or not only subsequent to the definition of alpha-equivalence. Principal types are shown to exist and an inference algorithm given to compute them. This system is then used to define two presentations of typed nominal rewriting, one more expressive and one more efficient, the latter also giving rise to a notion of typed nominal equational reasoning.},

We reach these results for a strict notion of type assignment for λ μ that is the natural restriction of the domain-based system of van Bakel et al. (2011) for λ μ by limiting the type inclusion relation to just intersection elimination. We show that this system respects β μ-equality, by showing both soundness and completeness results. We then define a notion of reduction on derivations that corresponds to cut-elimination, and show that this is strongly normalisable.
          We use this strong normalisation result to show an approximation result, and through that a characterisation of head-normalisation. Using the approximation result, we show that there is a very strong relation between the system of van Bakel et al. (2011) and ours.
          We then introduce a notion of type assignment that eliminates ω as an assignable type, and show, using the strong normalisation result for derivation reduction, that all terms typeable in this system are strongly normalisable as well, and show that all strongly normalisable terms are typeable.

Given the two 2D patterns, our approach automatically computes a 3D pop-up mechanism that transforms one pattern into the other; it also outputs a design blueprint, allowing the user to easily make the final model. We also present a theoretical analysis of basic transformation mechanisms; combining these basic mechanisms allows more flexibility of final designs. Using our approach, inexperienced users can create models in a short time; previously, even experienced artists often took weeks to manually create them. We demonstrate our method on a variety of real-world examples.},

  abstract = {This research presents a novel approach for translating legal texts into machine-executable computational logic to support the automation of public sector processes. Recognizing the high-stakes implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal domains, the proposed method emphasizes explainability by integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques with natural language processing (NLP), employing scope-restricted pattern matching and grammatical parsing. The methodology involves several key steps: document structure inference from raw legal text, semantically neutral pre-processing, identification and resolution of internal and external references, contextualization of legal paragraphs, and rule extraction. The extracted rules are formalized as Prolog predicates and visualized as structured textual lists and graphical decision trees to enhance interpretability. To demonstrate the automatic extraction of explainable rules from legal text, we develop a Law-as-Code prototype and validate it through a real-world case study at the Austrian Ministry of Finance. The system successfully extracts executable rules from the Austrian Study Funding Act, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This validation not only underscores the practical applicability of our method, but also highlights promising avenues for future research, particularly the integration of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the rule extraction pipeline, while preserving traceability and explainability.},

CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem with missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Then, the finite element approximation for the CDA is considered. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.},

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely recognized as a powerful tool for signal classification due to its robust mathematical foundation and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. Subdivision schemes, originally developed in computer graphics for geometric modeling, offer a novel and parametric approach to feature preprocessing by iteratively refining input data through an efficient computational procedure. This paper studies the impact of subdivision schemes on SVM performance in terms of class separability and provides insights into the relationship between feature transformation and SVM response. Specifically, it investigates the theoretical and empirical implications of applying subdivision schemes to input features in SVM-based classification. The conditions under which these schemes preserve or enhance class separability are analyzed, focusing on the tension parameter which governs both the smoothness properties of the limit curve and the subdivision rule at each iteration. An estimation method for the tension parameter from the training data is also provided. Experimental results, performed in the context of signal classification based on the wavelet scattering transform, demonstrate that the appropriate selection of the tension parameter of the scheme can significantly enhance class separability, highlighting that subdivision schemes are a promising tool for improving classification accuracy in machine learning workflows.},

Besides the velocity, magnetic field, and a Lagrange multiplier associated with the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, our approach introduces a convenient translation of the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor as additional unknowns. Consequently, we obtain a five-field mixed variational formulation within a Banach space framework, where the aforementioned variables are the main unknowns of the system, exploiting the skew-symmetric property of one of the involved operators. The resulting mixed scheme is then equivalently written as a fixed-point equation, allowing the application of the well-known Banach theorem, combined with classical results on nonlinear monotone operators and a sufficiently small data assumption, to prove the unique solvability of the continuous and discrete systems. In particular, the analysis of the discrete scheme requires a quasi-uniformity assumption on the mesh.

The computational problem is neither known to be NP-hard nor to be in NP. We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for each of these containers based on a reduction to finding a shortest Hamiltonian path in a weighted graph, which in turn models the problem of stabbing the centers of the input balls while keeping them disjoint. We also show that for n such balls, a container of volume O ( n d − 1 d ) is always sufficient and sometimes necessary. As a byproduct, this implies that for d ⩾ 2 there is no finite size ( d + 1 ) -dimensional convex body into which all d-dimensional unit-radius balls can be packed simultaneously.},

  abstract = {In homogenization theory, mathematical models at the macro level are constructed based on the solution of auxiliary cell problems at the micro level within a single periodicity cell. These problems are formulated using asymptotic expansions of the solution with respect to a small parameter, which represents the characteristic size of spatial heterogeneity. When studying diffusion equations with contrasting coefficients, special attention is given to nonlocal models with weakly conducting inclusions. In this case, macro-level processes are described by integro-differential equations, where the difference kernel is determined by the solution of a nonstationary cell problem. The main contribution of this work is the development of a computational framework for the homogenization of nonstationary processes, accounting for memory effects. The effective diffusion tensor is computed using a standard numerical procedure based on finite element discretization in space. The memory kernel is approximated by a sum of exponentials obtained from solving a partial spectral problem on the periodicity cell. The nonlocal macro-level problem is transformed into a local one, where memory effects are incorporated through the solution of auxiliary nonstationary problems. Standard two-level time discretization schemes are employed, and unconditional stability of the discrete solutions is proved in appropriate norms. Key aspects of the proposed computational homogenization technique are illustrated by solving a two-dimensional model problem.},

  abstract = {In scientific computing, the burgeoning usage of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations(PDEs) has spurred the need for, and ongoing research into, more accurate and efficient PINNs. One bottleneck of current PINNs is the computation of the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources especially when dealing with complex PDEs and high dimensional problems. To tackle this, we propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to PINNs, our framework requires less GPU memory and a shorter training time. Furthermore, the exponential convergence of the spectral basis makes our approach more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between the physics domain and the spectral domain, we provide a strategy to efficiently train networks in spectral domain. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.},

  abstract = {This study presents the Hybrid Butter-Flower Algorithm (HBFA), an innovative metaheuristic optimization approach that combines the strengths of the Sunflower Optimization Algorithm (SOA) and the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to improve convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness. While proficient in exploration, SOA may lack the aggressive exploitation required for swift convergence, potentially slowing down solution refinement. However, BOA might experience premature convergence in challenging milieu that results in demurrer in local optima. HBFA handles these challenges by amalgamating SOA’s unique exploration nuances with BOA’s effectual exploitation techniques, assuring an optimum exchange between orbicular and localized search. The algorithm is assessed on 23 unimodal and multimodal standard functions and six constrained mechanical design optimization problems with real-world applications. The performance of HBFA is benchmarked against nine state-of-the-art optimization methods, including PSO, SSA, and HSA, based on metrics such as best solution, average solution, and convergence rate. The results demonstrate that HBFA attains the highest performance efficiency (96.69 %), accomplishing all competitive algorithms by epochal margins, with amelioration ranging from 21 % to 63 % over conventional approaches. Notably, the proposed HBFA is 83.25 % faster in finding the optimal solution than other algorithms without falling for premature convergence and local optima. The superiority of HBFA is further validated through Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman statistical tests, with an average p-value of 3.14E-10, confirming its statistically significant advantage. Given to its adaptive nature and rapid convergence, HBFA emerges as a powerful tool for addressing complex optimization challenges in engineering, artificial intelligence, and industrial applications.},

For numerical simulation of such coupled problems in applications, robust and efficient computational algorithms are needed. In this work, we consider a generalization of the Beavers–Joseph interface condition recently developed using homogenization and boundary layer theory. This extension is applicable not only for the parallel flows to the fluid–porous interface as its predecessor, but also for arbitrary flow directions. To solve the Stokes–Darcy problem with these generalized interface conditions efficiently, we develop and analyze a Robin–Robin domain decomposition method using Fourier analysis to identify optimal weights in the Robin interface conditions. We study efficiency and robustness of the proposed method and provide numerical simulations which confirm the obtained theoretical results.},

Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the newly developed splitting approach.},

Accurately capturing the macroscopic behavior of such systems poses significant computational challenges due to the dynamic fine-scale geometries. In this paper, we develop a robust and generalizable multiscale modeling framework based on multicontinuum homogenization to derive effective macroscopic equations in shrinking domains. The method distinguishes multiple continua according to the physical characteristics (e.g., channel widths), and couples them via space–time local cell problems formulated on representative volume elements. These local problems incorporate temporal derivatives and domain evolution, ensuring consistency with underlying fine-scale dynamics. The resulting upscaled system yields computable macroscopic coefficients and is suitable for large-scale simulations. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and potential applicability of the method to complex time-dependent engineering problems.},

  abstract = {The approximation of data is a fundamental challenge encountered in various fields, including computer-aided geometric design, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, or the design of curves and surfaces. Numerous methods have been developed to address this issue, providing good results when the data is continuous. Among these, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) method has proven to be an effective strategy for fitting data, finding applications in both statistics and applied mathematics. However, the presence of isolated discontinuities in the data can lead to undesirable artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon, which adversely affects the quality of the approximation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Moving Least Squares method with the well-established non-linear Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method. This combination aims to construct a non-linear operator that enhances the accuracy of approximations near discontinuities while maintaining the order of accuracy in smooth regions. We investigate the properties of this operator in one dimension, demonstrating its effectiveness through a series of numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {The construction of B-spline wavelet bases on nonequispaced knots is extended to wavelets that are piecewise segments from any combination of smooth functions. The extended wavelet family thus provides multiresolution basis functions with support as compact as possible and belonging to a user controlled smoothness class. The construction proceeds in two phases. In the first phase of segmentation, a set of smooth functions is used in the welding of compact supported, piecewise smooth basis functions. These piecewise smooth basis functions are refinable, meaning that they can be written as linear combinations of similar basis functions constructed on a finer grid of knots. The expression of the linear combination between the bases at two scales is known as a refinement or two-scale equation. In the second phase, the refinability enables the construction of a wavelet transform. To this end, the refinement equation of the piecewise smooth scaling functions is factored into a lifting scheme, to which the desired properties of the subsequent wavelet basis can then be added. Special attention is paid to proper boundary treatment. Next to the details of the construction, the paper discusses the conditions for it to fit into the classical framework of multiresolution analyses.},

This framework could embed delay differential equations into neural networks to accommodate the diverse requirements of DDEs in terms of initial conditions, control equations, and known data. PINN-DDEs adjust the network parameters through automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms to minimize the loss function, thereby obtaining numerical solutions to the delay differential equations without the grid dependence and polynomial interpolation typical of traditional numerical methods. In addressing inverse problems, the PINN-DDEs framework can utilize observational data to perform precise estimation of single or multiple delay parameters, which is very important in practical mathematical modeling. The results of multiple numerical experiments have shown that PINN-DDEs demonstrate high precision in both forward and inverse problems, proving their effectiveness and promising potential in dealing with delayed differential equation issues.},

This prior preserves sharp edges in the intermediate latent image and enhances the restoration of the blur kernel. We then propose a total curvature weighted image surface minimization model.

We show that the proposed Toeplitz solver achieves exceptional efficiency, especially when utilizing GPU acceleration in PyTorch, all while maintaining accuracy. For the demonstration of numerical results based on the proposed digital uncoupling algorithm and the effect of attenuation, we use S-parameters at 1.4 GHz of an 8-element sub-array and a 16-element sub-array. We show that the diagonal elements of the uncoupling matrices steadily decrease as one moves away from the main diagonal, highlighting the diminishing effect of mutual coupling and the predominance of self-coupling over mutual coupling. Finally, an 8-element signal flow graph will be presented to show the uncoupling of mutual coupling effects of antenna arrays in digital signal processing perspective.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel robust trajectory planning strategy. The method formulates the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem using polynomial chaos expansion and solves it through an adaptive sequential convex optimization algorithm. The strategy is applied to two common port handling equipment systems, validating its effectiveness in handling parameter uncertainties. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances computational efficiency by at least 45% and achieves greater consistency and robustness compared to existing advanced methods, with its outcomes closely aligning Monte Carlo simulations. The key contributions include a new robust trajectory planning approach, improved prediction accuracy via simultaneous state and control variable expansion, and enhanced computational efficiency for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems.},

Compared with the MMS method (Commu. Appl. Math. Comput., 2023) proposed very recently, the MMMS iteration method does not involve inner iterations and its initial vector can be adopted unlimitedly. And it is no need to solve a linear subsystem with the coefficient matrix

Besides, we study the convergence conditions of the MMMS iteration method for two types of system matrices, which contain and generalize some related results. Also, the selection method for the parameter matrix of the MMMS method is proposed. At the end, the effectiveness and superiority of the MMMS method are verified by numerical experiments.},

                      Both upper bounds are tight in the sense that there are input instances that require these many cameras. Our proofs are constructive and suggest simple polynomial-time algorithms for placing these many cameras.
                  We then generalize the above bounds to arbitrary convex-shape buildings. We can guard the free space of k buildings of total size m by

  abstract = {Metaheuristic algorithms are commonly used optimization techniques for solving high-dimensional complex problems. To achieve more successful results, improvements are made on these metaheuristic algorithms. This study aims to enhance the performance of the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) Algorithm, a neighborhood-based metaheuristic algorithm. To this end, MBO is implemented on a high-performance computing (HPC) architecture using Open MPI, and the Multi-Island Distributed Migrating Birds Optimization (MIDMBO) Algorithm is developed. MIDMBO is a distributed metaheuristic optimization algorithm that utilizes multiple islands, where successful solutions migrate between islands. The migration process between islands, facilitated by MPI, enables MIDMBO to generate more successful outcomes. Therefore, studies focused on the migration process are of great importance. In this study, the relationship between algorithm performance and variations in fundamental migration parameters such as migration rate, migration interval, and the number of islands is examined. Regression analyses are performed on the results obtained from MIDMBO, and the model that best explains performance variation is identified. Additionally, artificial neural network (ANN) models are constructed, and the degree to which changes in parameter values explain the results is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Many practical applications of Navier–Stokes problems require solving sequences of saddle-point systems. These systems often arise from the mixed-finite element discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations. A popular strategy to solve them is by combining preconditioning techniques with Krylov subspace methods, which has proven effective in achieving computational efficiency. Since global Krylov subspace methods are specifically designed for solving saddle-point problems with multiple right-hand sides, they cannot be utilized to solve sequences of these problems. We propose an alternative approach applicable to matrices with a saddle-point structure. In this new approach, projection into the null-space of the block-(2,1) of the saddle-point matrix leads to a linear system with several right-hand sides. Due to the large scale and ill-conditioned nature of these linear systems, effective solvers must be implemented. Instead of applying a standard iterative method to solve each linear system independently, it is often more effective to apply a global method. Here, we develop and assess various methods for solving linear systems with several right-hand sides, with a special focus on the preconditioned global conjugate gradient (PGCG) method. We show that our suggested approach is highly effective for sequences of saddle-point systems with varying matrices. The efficiency of our new approach is evaluated by measuring computational time.},

  abstract = {Differential equations posed on quadratic matrix Lie groups arise in the context of classical mechanics and quantum dynamical systems. Lie group numerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group. Thus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as unitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems, for instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group integrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie groups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and need to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve the Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of Cayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups while being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley–Magnus methods the method is also free from nested matrix commutators.},

  abstract = {This research introduces a novel numerical technique based on shifted Gegenbauer wavelets for solving Fredholm–Volterra fractional integro-differential equations (FVFIDEs), a class characterized by the presence of both Fredholm and Volterra integral parts. By assuming properties of the fractional derivative and applying the wavelet solution directly to the equation, the problem is transferred to finding the family of solutions of the system of algebraic equations, whose solutions are the coefficients of the series of wavelet solutions. The accuracy and efficiency of the Gegenbauer wavelet approach are primarily evaluated through a direct comparison against solutions generated using the Genocchi polynomials method for established test problems. The study demonstrates that the shifted Gegenbauer wavelet method provides precise and effective solutions, which were analyzed under varying resolution parameters and degrees of Gegenbauer polynomials.},

It has been shown that the DSW system is solvable using the extended CRE (ECRE) method. By utilizing the ECRE method, interaction solutions between solitons and Jacobi sine periodic waves are explicitly obtained for the DSW system. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of these interactions is analyzed in detail.},

  abstract = {We investigate multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the system of measures obtained by applying a Christoffel transform to each of the orthogonality measures. We present an algorithm for computing the transformed recurrence coefficients and determinantal formulas for the transformed multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II. We apply these results to show that zeros of multiple orthogonal polynomials of an Angelesco or an AT system interlace with the zeros of the polynomials corresponding to its one-step Christoffel transform. This allows us to prove a number of interlacing properties satisfied by the multiple orthogonality analogues of classical orthogonal polynomials. For the discrete polynomials, this also produces an estimate on the smallest distance between consecutive zeros. We also identify a connection between the Christoffel transform of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonality systems containing a finitely supported measure. In consequence, the compatibility relations for the nearest neighbour recurrence coefficients provide a new algorithm for the computation of the Jacobi coefficients of the one-step or multi-step Christoffel transforms.},

We first present an explicit formula for the inverses of these matrices, based on tensor products and the inverses of general anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices. An efficient algorithm for matrix inversion is then proposed, reducing memory requirements for storing these matrices and simplifying analysis by leveraging the properties of tensor products. Additionally, we introduce a cost-effective algorithm for computing the determinants of generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices, transforming the problem into that of lower-order anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrix determinants. We also derive an explicit formula for determinant evaluation. Numerical results from MATLAB simulations demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and performance of the proposed algorithms, which are compared to MATLAB built-in functions, showing clear advantages in computational accuracy and speed.},

  abstract = {This study presents an efficient numerical framework for solving an inverse heat equation problem involving a time-dependent heat source and temperature distribution. The problem incorporates non-classical boundary conditions and integral over-determination conditions, where the latter represents error-contaminated measurements. A time-stepping scheme is employed to discretize the time derivative, while a meshless local collocation method using radial basis functions (RBFs) is applied for spatial discretization. The stability and convergence of the time-discretized approach are rigorously established using the energy method. To address noise in input data, Tikhonov regularization of three orders is implemented, along with a novel approach for determining the optimal regularization parameter. This method outperforms traditional techniques such as the quasi-optimality criterion, L-curve, and discrepancy principle. Numerical experiments validate the approach by demonstrating its accuracy for exact data and stability under noisy conditions, thereby establishing it as a reliable tool for inverse problem-solving.},

First, it is analyzed the case where both matrices diagonalize simultaneously, and sufficient conditions to obtain linear stability are proved. However, the paper focuses on the case where the matrices A and B are not simultaneously diagonalizable. The concept of field of values, denoted by F ( ⋅ ) , is used to prove a sufficient condition for unconditional stability of these methods: if A is Hermitian, IMEX-BDF2 is unconditionally stable whenever F ( A − 1 B ) is contained in the disk centered at 0 and radius 1 3 , D ( 0 , 1 3 ) , while IMEX-BDF3 is unconditionally stable whenever F ( A − 1 B ) ⊆ D ( 0 , 1 7 ) . Furthermore, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stability, but according to the step size as a function of the radius of the disk containing F ( A − 1 B ) . The approach developed herein is illustrated through several examples in which the discussed theory is applied not only to DDEs, but also to parabolic problems given by partial delay differential equations (PDDEs) with a diffusion term.},

The results demonstrate that contact with nature during tourism significantly enhances creative thinking compared to everyday contexts. Mental bandwidth partially mediates this dynamic, with openness to experience further moderating the impact of nature contact contexts on mental bandwidth. These findings advance the literature by highlighting the distinctive social and psychological benefits of tourism in promoting creativity beyond what is typically experienced in everyday life.},

Error estimates for these approximants are also derived, and estimates for the box-dimension of the graphs of fractal cubic multiquadric approximants are given. Numerical examples are presented to validate these theoretical findings and highlight the benefits of the fractal quasi-interpolant L d α f .

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel domain-based regularization approach for estimating landslide thickness from surface velocity data. Such quantity is crucial for accurately assessing landslides behavior, potential impact, and associated risks. Here, we formulate the problem as an ill-posed inverse problem and propose, for its solution, a multipenalty regularization approach based on the decomposition of the landslide domain in several regions with uniform magnitude of the horizontal velocity. We extend the Balancing Principle to accommodate non-constant balancing parameters across decomposed regions. Our Domain-based Majorization-Minimization algorithm converges to solutions that satisfy this extended principle, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. Through rigorous testing on both synthetic and real-world landslide data, we show that strategic domain decomposition based on velocity field homogeneity enhances estimation accuracy. Our findings reveal that while excessive subdivision is counterproductive, identifying appropriate velocity-based macro-regions yields optimal results. This methodology provides more reliable thickness estimates crucial for landslide risk assessment and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Fibonacci is known in particular due to the notion of the golden ratio, which has found great success in modeling natural phenomena. Also, based on this ratio, the Fibonacci polynomials emerged, which are employed in this work to establish an innovative family of fractional kernels. After showing that the family of kernels is well defined, we define two fractional derivatives, one of Caputo type and one of Riemann–Liouville type. Next, we demonstrate certain bound characteristics that the newly defined derivatives have. We also define the associated fractional integral for one of the family members of the newly defined derivative. Using the method of Laplace transform, we found explicit solutions for

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of semiconductor device with heat and magnetic influences is a preliminary problem in information science. In this paper, mathematical model, numerical method and theoretical analysis are discussed. Four major physical unknowns (the potential, electron concentration, hole concentration, and the heat) are defined by several nonlinear PDEs, an elliptic equation, two convection–diffusion equations and a heat conductor equation. A block-centered numerical method with conservative nature is used to obtain the potential, and the computational accuracy is improved. An upwind block-centered difference method is adopted for solving other PDEs on changing meshes. The diffusion and convection operators are discretized by block-centered differences and upwind differences, respectively. Changing meshes are effective for simulating the status nearby P-N junction. The composite scheme avoids numerical dispersion and nonphysical oscillation, and the conservation is preserved. The unknowns and their adjoint vectors are computed at the same time. Some theoretical techniques such as energy norm estimates, the method of duality and mathematical induction are used to finish convergence analysis. Error results are concluded. Finally, numerical examples show the efficiency and possible application.},

The proof technique employs a unified framework integrating the semi-group properties of integer-order calculus with fractional operators and proceeds via a counterfactual argument by assuming the existence of a non-oscillatory solution and deriving a contradiction. The results presented here significantly extend the existing oscillation theory for fractional differential equations with multiple derivatives. The theoretical findings are further illustrated with some examples.},

  abstract = {Inverse magnetisation problem consists in inferring information about a magnetic source from measurements of its magnetic field. Unlike a general magnetisation distribution, the total magnetisation (net moment) of the source is a quantity that theoretically can be uniquely determined from the field. At the same time, it is often the most useful quantity for practical applications (on large and small scales) such as detection of a magnetic anomaly in magnetic prospection problem or finding the overall strength and mean direction of the magnetisation distribution of a magnetised rock sample. It is known that the net moment components can be explicitly estimated using the so-called Helbig’s integrals which involve integration of the magnetic field data on the plane against simple polynomials. Evaluation of these integrals requires knowledge of the magnetic field data on a large region or the use of ad hoc methods to compensate for the lack thereof. In this paper, we derive higher-order analogs of Helbig’s integrals which permit estimation of total magnetisation components in terms of measurement data available on a smaller region. Motivated by a concrete experimental setup for analysing remanent magnetisation of rock samples with a scanning microscope, we also extend Helbig’s integrals to the situation when knowledge of only one field component is necessary. Moreover, apart from derivation of these novel formulas, we rigorously prove their accuracy. The presented approach, based on an appropriate splitting in the Fourier domain and estimates of oscillatory integrals (involving both small and large parameters), elucidates the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the net moment components to an arbitrary order, a possibility that was previously unclear. The obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect to the noise is discussed.},

Aiming at addressing this issue, in this paper, we use the High-order Tensor Nuclear Norm (HTNN) to approximate the Hankel tensor rank, thus a new model named MDT-HTNN is proposed for low-rank tensor completion. Efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the proposed model and its convergence analysis is discussed in detail. Extensive experiments on a series of color images and MRI illustrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improve the recovery accuracy. Specifically, under multiple sampling rate settings for multiple color images, the average PSNR value increased by 14.8% and the CPU time decreased by 89.5% compared with the classical MDT-Tucker method.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of recovering the spatial distribution of the source term in a parabolic system from local measurement data. We propose a method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the solution of this inverse problem. Within this framework, we design a novel loss function that incorporates the residuals of the partial differential equation (PDE), measurement data residuals, as well as residuals from initial–boundary conditions and boundary derivatives. These additional terms enhance the regularity of the solution to address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Based on the conditional stability of the inverse problem, we demonstrate that the neural network can effectively approximate its solution, and we further establish generalization error estimates for the source term, which depend on the training error and data noise level, while also verifying the convergence of the network. A series of numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, showing that it achieves high accuracy and efficiency under noisy data and varying measurement conditions.},

This problem can be modeled using a coupled system of Stokes equations and Darcy’s law. Finite element discretization of the coupled Stokes–Darcy model results in a double saddle-point system. In this work, we propose a class of inexact block three-by-three triangular preconditioners for these discretized saddle-point systems by fully utilizing their special structure. When used to precondition Krylov subspace methods, each step requires solving only three simple symmetric positive definite linear subsystems. Additionally, we derive explicit and sharp spectral bounds for the preconditioned matrices and show that all eigenvalues have positive real parts. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our preconditioners in solving the coupled Stokes–Darcy model.},

This study addresses this challenge by integrating clinoptilolite zeolite as a passive moisture adsorbent into a thin-layer solar dryer and evaluating its effect on green pea drying performance under suboptimal spring conditions in Balıkesir, Turkey. Two experimental trials, conventional and zeolite-enhanced, were conducted on consecutive days with closely matched weather profiles.
                  The results show that zeolite integration shortened total drying time by 7.1 % (from 7.0 to 6.5 hours) and increased the peak drying rate by 42 %. A 15 % reduction in chamber relative humidity was observed, along with improved energy metrics: 4.6 % lower specific energy consumption (SEC) and 5.4 % higher specific moisture extraction rate (SMER). Six thin-layer drying models were evaluated using genetic algorithm optimization. Among them, the proposed four-parameter Karasu model outperformed others, achieving R² = 0.9968 and RMSE = 0.0174. Sensitivity analysis identified the shape parameter (n) as the most influential. Zeolite moisture uptake followed a logarithmic trend, reaching 92.6 g (18.5 g/kg). The results confirm that zeolite effectively improves drying kinetics and humidity control under challenging conditions. The Karasu model provides a reliable tool for predicting drying behavior in solar drying systems.},

  abstract = {Reliability engineering addresses the challenge of analyzing how components contribute to system failures when designing large and complex systems. This analysis is commonly referred to as importance analysis. One specific type of importance measure is Joint Structural Importance (JSI), which assesses the significance of two or more components based on their positions within the system. This measure helps in effectively allocating redundancy and guiding design decisions to enhance overall reliability. This paper proposes a new method for computing the JSI of independent components within a coherent system. The key idea is to utilize Logical Differential Calculus, specifically through the Direct Partial Logical Derivatives (DPLD). Applying the DPLD for calculating the JSI based on the indicator function is a novel approach. Notably, this method allows for calculating the JSI from the structure function represented by a truth table without the need to transform the function into a Boolean expression. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the application and advantages of the proposed method. Additionally, case studies on a substation automation system and an auxiliary feedwater system are conducted to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness in engineering applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the valuation of American put options based on the 4/2 stochastic volatility model that incorporates multiscale double mean-reverting (DMR) volatility. The option price problem is transformed into a partial differential equation (PDE) problem with free boundary, which in turn leads to PDE problems for a few terms of asymptotic expansions of the option price and free boundary. The approximate American put price is decomposed into the sum of the corresponding European put price and the early exercise premium. The chosen modification of the 4/2 stochastic volatility allows for a step-by-step approach to the option price starting from the Black–Scholes price of the corresponding European option, making it easier to approximate the price of an American put option. We check the accuracy of the resultant approximate option price and free boundary by using the least squares Monte Carlo simulation method and investigate the impact of the Heston and 3/2 factors of the volatility on the option price and free boundary. We calibrate our model to real market data and benchmark it against the widely used Heston model and the 3/2 model. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to show how small changes in model parameters influence the American put option premium and early exercise boundary, and discuss limiting scenarios when the 3/2 term vanishes or volatility becomes deterministic. In addition, two specific results are provided. We derive a semi-analytic solution for the approximate option price and free boundary when an American put option is near expiration. We also study the pricing of an American put option without an expiration date and obtain a closed-form analytic formula for the approximate option price and free boundary.},

These results are then employed to develop a numerical scheme for solving a general class of fractional integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernels. The approach, combined with the essential properties of the Caputo derivative and the Riemann–Liouville operator, leads to the definition of remainders associated with the main problem.

An error bound is established for the proposed approximation, and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through several illustrative examples.},

The main ingredients of the proofs are a constructive version of the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, Maurey’s theorem, and spline approximation results. The curse of dimensionality is lessened in the first case, while it is completely overcome in the second case. Since the considered ExSpliNet model can be regarded as a particular version of the recently introduced neural network architecture called Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN), our results also provide insights into the analysis of the expressivity of KANs.},

Especially the introduced Structured Deep Kernel Networks (SDKNs) can be viewed as neural networks (NNs) with optimizable activation functions obeying a representer theorem. This link allows us to analyze also NNs within the framework of kernel networks. We prove analytic properties of the SDKNs which show their universal approximation properties in three different asymptotic regimes of unbounded number of centers, width and depth. Especially in the case of unbounded depth, more accurate constructions can be achieved using fewer layers compared to corresponding constructions for ReLU neural networks.

  abstract = {Cusp-type catastrophe is the most commonly encountered and widely applicable type among elementary catastrophes. However, the canonical mathematical model of the cusp-type catastrophe, constructed using the classical regularization method in catastrophe theory, often lacks quantitative prediction capability. This issue arises from the regularization operations involved in the regularization method, particularly the Taylor expansion and truncation of the potential function, which can introduce unforeseen and potentially large regularization errors. To address this issue, a novel precise regularization method is proposed, which bypasses the Taylor expansion of the potential function and instead employs a global diffeomorphism to achieve precise regularization of the cusp-type catastrophe mathematical model. Using the proposed method, the precise regularization of the cusp-type catastrophe mathematical model for Zeeman catastrophe machine is achieved. Computational results show that the model obtained via the proposed method has significantly lower regularization errors than the classical method, thus meeting the requirements for constructing catastrophe models with quantitative predictive capability. Moreover, due to the implementation of the global diffeomorphism, the proposed precise regularization method can be easily modified into the experimental modeling approach (inverse regularization method) of catastrophe theory, enabling the development of experimental mathematical models of cusp-type catastrophe with quantitative predictive capability for specific catastrophe phenomena. Taking the chip flow angle catastrophe as an example, the detailed implementation steps of this experimental modeling approach are demonstrated. This work not only contributes to the refinement and advancement of catastrophe theory but also addresses practical challenges encountered in its application.},

  abstract = {Pixel mapping is a computational approach that involves the analysis of individual pixels within digital images to extract clinically relevant information. This technique offers significant advantages in medical imaging applications, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing treatment planning. By reducing the need for complex manual programming, pixel mapping also contributes to workflow efficiency. The incorporation of machine learning strategies, such as transfer learning and other advanced algorithms, has further extended the capabilities of pixel mapping by enabling the segmentation of intricate anatomical structures and the detection of pathological anomalies in medical scans. Given the global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which account for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually early diagnosis and effective clinical management remain paramount. This figure constitutes approximately 32% of all global deaths, with 85% of the deaths being because of heart attacks and strokes. In addition, 38% of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases occur at an early age in individuals under 70. Among these conditions, heart failure represents a major complication, underscoring the need for innovative diagnostic technologies like pixel-based analysis. This paper proposes an innovative hybrid model, which is Pixel Mapping Multi-Modal Medical Image -based Neural Networks (PMMI- NNs), by combining transfer and machine learning for diagnosing cardiovascular disease using pixel map images. Heart failure is also a common consequence of these diseases, which makes early diagnosis and management critical. This paper proposes an innovative hybrid model, which is Pixel Mapping Multi-Modal Medical Image -based Neural Networks (PMMI- NNs), by combining transfer and machine learning for diagnosing cardiovascular disease using pixel map images. Six different pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models extract the significant features from the images: DenseNet121, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 and MobileNetV2. The Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm is applied to improve classification accuracy and select the most discriminative features. The selected features are then classified by three machine learning algorithms, which are the k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The findings obtained by the analyses demonstrate that integration of transfer learning, feature selection, and machine learning proves to be effective in improving CVD diagnosis in medical image analysis, providing a scalable and applicable framework for future clinical applications. The primary objective of the study whose datasets include clinical and physiological signal elements is to compare different machine learning and deep learning approaches to identify the most effective methods for early diagnostic process of cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {We present a novel class of methods to compute functions of matrices or their action on vectors that are suitable for parallel programming and can improve the performance of exponential integrators. Solving appropriate linear systems of equations in parallel (or computing the inverse of several matrices) and with a proper linear combination of the results, allows us to obtain new high order approximations to the desired functions of matrices. An error analysis to obtain forward and backward error bounds is presented. The coefficients of each method, which depends on the number of processors, can be adjusted to improve the accuracy, the stability or to reduce the round off errors of the methods. We illustrate this procedure by explicitly constructing some methods which are then tested on several numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Despite the wide applications of nonlinear functional mixed Volterra-Fredholm equations (VFIEs), not much attention has been paid to their numerical analysis. Further, a well-known challenge in solving nonlinear integral equations is the problem of simultaneously achieving high-order accuracy, computational efficiency and avoiding to solve nonlinear algebraic systems. For contraction maps in Banach spaces, fixed-point iterative methods can address the problem of solving systems. However, the issues of computational efficiency, high-order accuracy, and approximation of functional VFIEs remain largely unaddressed. In this article, a new cubature rule is proposed and used to develop a high (fourth) order method for nonlinear functional mixed VFIEs. To ensure computational efficiency and avoid solving systems, a Gauss–Seidel-type algorithm (GSTA) is formulated. In this case of GSTA, the convergence proof becomes quite challenging (no wonder the inefficient Jacobi-type idea is very popular in the literature). We use the Banach contraction principle and mathematical induction to rigorously prove the fourth-order convergence of the method. Several numerical examples are used to verify the theoretical convergence results. It is our belief that both the numerical scheme and convergence proof presented in this paper will serve researchers in devising and analyzing efficient, high-order schemes for other integral equations, even in higher dimensions.},

  abstract = {The HLLEM scheme is a popular numerical method for computing the convective fluxes in the Euler equations and the Navier–Stokes equations due to its accuracy and positivity-preserving. However, it still has two defects. One is the numerical instability, such as the carbuncle phenomenon, in computations involving multidimensional strong shock waves; the other is the non-physical results caused by accuracy issues in computations of low Mach number flows. In the engineering field, high Mach number flows with strong shock waves and low Mach number flows often coexist. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a numerical scheme that is both accurate and robust across all Mach number flows. The shock instabilities of the HLLEM scheme are addressed by simply modifying the wave speeds to balance advection dissipation and acoustic dissipation. Additionally, the performance in computing low-speed flows is improved by controlling the excessive numerical dissipation corresponding to the velocity-difference terms in the momentum equations. Numerical results from high Mach number test cases and low Mach number test cases demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme for simulating flows across all Mach number.},

The numerical solution of the proposed system is obtained by adopting the conformable Adomian decomposition method (CADM). Some basic dynamical characteristics are employed either numerically or analytically to demonstrate the chaotic dynamical behaviors of the new system, including equilibrium points and their stability, Lyapunov exponents spectrum, fractal dimension, bifurcation diagrams, and complexity analysis. The fractional calculus theory and computer simulations reveal that the system’s lowest order to yield chaos is 0.461. Bifurcation diagrams, phase plots, and a multiscale spectral entropy (MSE) complexity analysis validate the results. Additionally, chaos synchronization of the novel conformable fractional-order chaotic system is achieved by designing a suitable nonlinear controller, based on the stability theory of fractional-order dynamical systems. Furthermore, this paper constructs a new scheme for encrypting color images based on chaos synchronization to enhance practicality. Experiments and computer simulations are conducted to verify the performance and security of the proposed image cryptosystem.},

Two distinct approaches are introduced, each leveraging this framework to deliver efficient and accurate iterative solutions.

Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the equivalent PML model in absorbing outgoing waves.},

We solve the NDOT formulation using the general-proximal primal–dual hybrid gradient (G-prox PDHG) algorithm, and then introduce a novel preconditioner derived from the discretization of the space–time fractional PDE to accelerate the convergence. Numerical experiments – especially those with target states represented by power functions typical of fractional differential equation solutions – show that our model substantially reduces kinetic energy costs compared with its integer-order counterparts, highlighting its effectiveness and applicability for complex phenomena such as anomalous transport in heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces and analyzes four discretization techniques, all based on Chebyshev polynomial approximation methods, in application to a resolvent analysis of channel flow. Resolvent analysis seeks to identify high-gain responses of a linearized input–output operator of a given physical process, hereby represented by a fluid flow system driven by external perturbations. To approximate the governing equations system, differentiation-based and integration-based Chebyshev techniques are developed. Additionally, two different strategies of a solution approximation are considered: the spectral-space (tau) approximation, and the physical-space (collocation) approximation. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of these different methods with respect to their accuracy and efficiency of computing resolvent approximation of the linearized Navier–Stokes (LNS) equations system. In addition to the LNS system, a boundary value problem in one variable is considered first, to relate the properties of the developed methods to previous findings in the literature based on simple systems. We analyze the important metrics as related to the problem of interest, which include the

To this purpose, the present paper studies the mixed counterpart of the classical Panjer family of claim number distributions and their compound version, by allowing the parameters of the distributions to be viewed as random variables. Under the assumptions that the claim size process is conditionally i.i.d. and (conditionally) independent of the claim counts, we provide a recursive formula for the computation of the probability mass function of the aggregate claim sizes.

In Taiwan, the 2019 curriculum reform has positioned inquiry as an interdisciplinary core competency for all preservice teachers. However, previous studies have indicated that preservice teachers face significant challenges during the planning stages of inquiry and have emphasized the need for explicit instruction in teacher education programs. Given that empirical studies addressing these gaps remain limited, the present study employed a case study approach to examine the effectiveness of an inquiry thinking scaffold in a 16-week foundational course in a teacher education program in Taiwan. Analyses of 16 participants’ performance and written reflections revealed that developing a coherent inquiry plan involved a steep learning curve, with challenges emerging in the early stages and evolving as learning progressed. The major challenges included achieving logical coherence and identifying research gaps. The findings support the effectiveness of the thinking scaffold and highlight the importance of fostering preservice teachers’ awareness of logical coherence, as well as engaging them in the process of knowledge construction. Although the effects were limited, this study also found that IBL experience could enhance preservice teachers’ self-efficacy for teaching inquiry. Implications for instructional and curricular adaptations to better integrate inquiry into teacher education programs are discussed.},

We examined associations between three performance-based creativity measures and one parent-report measure of creativity. Findings from bivariate analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed substantive associations within and non-substantive associations between creativity tasks and parent-report items. Results provide preliminary evidence of diversity in performance-based assessments and unity in parent-report measures of preschool creativity. Results also showed inconsistent associations between performance-based and parent-report measures of creativity in preschool, suggesting measures are capturing different facets of preschoolers' creativity.

However, the high cost of collecting responses or labels often leads to a scarcity of samples, which significantly diminishes the accuracy of statistical inferences, particularly in high-dimensional settings. To address this limitation, transfer learning can be utilized for high-dimensional data with discrete responses by incorporating relevant source data into the target study of interest. Within the framework of generalized linear models, the case where responses are bounded are first considered, and an importance-weighted transfer learning method, referred to as IWTL-DR, is proposed. This method selects data at the individual level, thereby utilizing the source data more efficiently. Subsequently, this approach is extended to scenarios involving unbounded responses. Theoretical properties of the IWTL-DR method are established and compared with existing techniques. Extensive simulations and analyses of real data show the advantages of our approach.},

This paper explores the mathematical structure of the a posteriori rate and its corresponding statistical properties. As in the cases of the Bayes premium and the credibility premium, the a posteriori rate depends on both the a priori rate and the claim history in general. However, in certain cases, such as the bonus-malus premium in auto insurance, the a posteriori rate depends solely on the claim history. We refer to such insurance premiums, where the a posteriori rate is solely a function of the claim history, as commercial insurance premiums. Although the simplified structure of commercial insurance premiums enhances communication with policyholders, it can introduce a systematic bias known as the double counting problem. The insurance literature has empirically identified this bias in bonus-malus systems. Our study extends the existing empirical analysis of bonus-malus systems to a wider range of commercial insurance premiums and provides a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that any commercial insurance premium is susceptible to the double counting problem. Then, we propose a simple solution to mitigate this issue while retaining the structural simplicity of the commercial insurance premium. Numerical analysis, including real data analysis, demonstrates the extent of the double counting problem in commercial insurance premiums and the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating this issue.},

                  Feedback, both human and computer-assisted, plays a critical role in scaffolding learners’ development, especially within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through interaction with more knowledgeable others. While recent studies have examined the role of Generative AI (GenAI) in supporting second language learning, its potential in translation pedagogy remains underexplored.
               
                  Objectives
                  This paper examines how GenAI feedback influences learners’ performance, motivation, and preferences in an ESL translation course. Based on the sociocultural theory, it emphasizes that all feedback sources should meet learners’ developmental needs.
               
                  Methods
                  This study adopted a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design, incorporating pre- and post-tests, a composite questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. A total of 84 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three ESL translation classes. At the initial stage, all participants received tutor feedback alongside unguided peer feedback. In the subsequent intervention phase, the Control Group (CG) continued with unguided peer feedback, the Experimental Group 1 (EG1) shifted to guided peer feedback, while the Experimental Group 2 (EG2) received AI-generated feedback in place of peer feedback. Tutor feedback remained consistent across all groups. This design facilitated both within-group and between-group comparisons, allowing the study to isolate the effects of feedback structure (guided vs. unguided peer feedback) and feedback source (peer/tutor vs. GenAI feedback).
               
                  Results and conclusion
                  The study found that guided peer feedback (EG1) led to the highest performance, significantly outperforming both unguided peer feedback (CG) and GenAI feedback (EG2). Although EG2’s performance lagged behind EG1, its learners showed the greatest increase in motivation. Feedback preferences ranked as: tutor > guided peer > GenAI > unguided peer. Learners appreciated GenAI’s accuracy, but noted issues such as limited creativity and emotional connection. The study suggests that human feedback, particularly guided peer and tutor feedback, provided stronger emotional support and adaptive scaffolding, fostering deeper cognitive engagement and a more empathetic environment compared to GenAI, which is correlated with higher performance and preference gains. While qualitative responses praised GenAI for accurate and comprehensive feedback, learners identified challenges such as information overload, limited creativity, and lack of emotional connection. The study suggests a hybrid feedback strategy integrating GenAI with human interactions to enhance translation pedagogy.},

This study rigorously identifies the fundamental reasons behind the bilinear scheme’s stability through theoretical analysis and further investigates the root cause of instability in the linear scheme observed in experiments. Based on these insights, two improvement strategies are proposed: one completely eliminates the instability, while the other significantly enhances numerical stability.},

  abstract = {Robust principal component analysis (RPCA), which aims to decompose observational data into low-rank and sparse matrices, has been widely used in various machine learning and low-vision tasks. The traditional methods use nuclear norms to approximate the rank function, which makes the obtained solution seriously deviate from the real one. Therefore, we propose a new RPCA model by employing a recently proposed truncated reweighting nuclear norm as a better approximation of low-rank constraint. The proposed model could not only preserve the main information of data as much as possible, but also greatly enhance the robustness of the model against noise or outliers. To solve this model, an efficient and simple optimization algorithm is designed by exploiting the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). More importantly, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is discussed in detail and rigorously mathematically proved. Experimental results on two typical low-vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm, that is, the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of visual and quantitative effects.},

  abstract = {This research explores neural network-based numerical approximation of two-dimensional convection-dominated singularly perturbed problems on square, circular, and elliptic domains. Singularly perturbed boundary value problems pose significant challenges due to sharp boundary layers in their solutions. Additionally, the characteristic points of these domains give rise to degenerate boundary layer problems. The stiffness of these problems, caused by sharp singular layers, can lead to substantial computational errors if not properly addressed. Conventional neural network-based approaches often fail to capture these sharp transitions accurately, highlighting a critical flaw in machine learning methods. To address these issues, we conduct a thorough boundary layer analysis to enhance our understanding of sharp transitions within the boundary layers, guiding the application of numerical methods. Specifically, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to better handle these boundary layer problems. However, PINNs may struggle with rapidly varying singularly perturbed solutions in small domain regions, leading to inaccurate or unstable results. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-analytic method that augments PINNs with singular layers or corrector functions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and stability, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Refractory medium entropy alloys (RMEAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their exceptional mechanical properties and high-temperature stability, making them suitable for a number of advanced applications. While computational modelling such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) are powerful for investigating RMEAs, these traditional methods are often constrained by high computational cost and limited accuracy. In this work, a deep neural network potential (DNNP) was developed to address the complex compositional nature of FeCr2V-based RMEAs with varying levels of tungsten doping. The DNNP demonstrated high accuracy, comparable to that of DFT calculations. Utilizing the DNNP, high-accuracy MD simulations were conducted to examine large-scale effects, including short-range ordering (SRO), twining, and dislocation behaviour, on the mechanical properties of the RMEAs. The results indicate that in the SRO structure, the covalency of V-V, Cr-Cr, and V-W ordered atomic pairs enhances local bonding strength and increases the elastic modulus of the RMEA. As the simulation temperature increases, dislocation mobility improves while dislocation density decreases, thereby enhancing the ductility of the material. Above 823 K, the SRO structure demonstrates superior mechanical performance, which is attributed to the increased length of 1/2 < 111>, dislocations facilitated by the formation of Cr-Fe and Cr-Cr ordered twins.

  abstract = {In this paper, a projected infeasible algorithm is proposed to compute the positive ground states of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, which can be regarded as an energy minimization problem with an orthogonal constraint. To further preserve the positivity of the ground states which is a necessary condition in some physical systems such as the non-rotating Bose–Einstein condensates, the saturable equation and the modified Gross–Pitaevskii equation, the projection is added to the infeasible method. The local Q-linearly convergence analysis of algorithm is established for the appropriate parameter values. Numerical experiments about computing the ground states of different types of the NLS equations illustrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and faster than other feasible algorithms in dealing with large-scale problems.},

  abstract = {Although some researchers have suggested that video games such as Minecraft have the potential to foster student creativity, little is known regarding how educational games should be designed to effectively promote creativity. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop an educational game by modifying Minecraft and evaluate the effects of two game design features, challenge and autonomy, on the in-game creative performance of middle school students. A creativity support game intervention was implemented with 88 sixth-grade students. The results revealed that games incorporating challenge and autonomy had a positive influence on students' in-game creative performance. This impact was observed to be mediated by two factors: creative self-efficacy and engagement. Findings of the current study suggest that designing educational games with specific features can enhance students' creative performance within the game environment.},

Nonetheless, doubts persist about aligning AR materials with learning goals and ensuring scientific accuracy. Current research trends highlight teachers as developers of mobile AR content (mAR) to address these gaps, yet few studies have explored biology-focused mAR. This study employed Diffusion of Innovations Theory and mixed-methods approach to examine pre-service biology teachers’ (PSBTs) perceptions of developing and integrating mAR in future teaching. Participants received training to develop their own mAR teaching content. Data are collected with using questionnaires and audio recorded discussions during training. Qualitative data were processed using content analysis, while quantitative data underwent descriptive statistics and Spearman's rank correlation. Results confirm that PSBTs are eager to produce and employ mAR materials in teaching. They believe such development stimulates creativity and fosters collaboration among teachers. Results indicate that PSBT are having opinions that teachers’ developed mAR resources can better address students’ needs, promote critical thinking, and enable hands-on experimentation that might otherwise be unfeasible. PSBTs also note that these materials can be blended with traditional tools and real-world natural surroundings, enhancing students’ connection with nature. However, technical complexity, accessibility of digital resources needs for mAR development, and lack of institutional support pose obstacles. Nonetheless, quantitative outcomes reveal a positive overall perception of mAR’s impact on teaching quality and student motivation, though PSBTs highlight the importance of ongoing training and stronger alliances with colleagues and educational managers.},

  abstract = {Scientific argumentation is a key competency in science education, yet creating effective online environments to support it remains a challenging task. Recent research in science education has focused on using online gamified learning as a means to cultivate scientific argumentation skills. This study introduces “hypotheticality” as a unidimensional construct in online learning contexts. Hypotheticality can be applied to both gamified learning and scientific topics. By categorizing three degrees of hypotheticality from low to high, learners acquire distinct learning experiences in direct, vicarious, and hypothetical contexts, progressing from reality to imagination. The study further explores how hypotheticality and gamified learning impact students’ scientific knowledge, motivation, and argumentation learnings. A quasi-experimental design was adopted, involving 254 eighth graders. An online learning platform was developed specifically for the study, using a baseball player’s career as the narrative setting and incorporating online scaffolding to facilitate collaborative scientific argumentation. The four components of scientific argumentation—claim, warrant, rebuttal, and qualifier—were analyzed in terms of their frequency and quality. Statistical analysis revealed an interaction between the two variables, demonstrating that gamified learning had the most positive impact in contexts with the highest degree of hypotheticality. Subsequent qualitative analysis indicated that students in the gamified condition and in contexts with a high degree of hypotheticality showed remarkable improvements in scientific knowledge, learning motivation, and argumentation performance. Notably, scientific arguments typically considered challenging to construct, such as evidence-based rebuttals and qualifiers, were effectively explored and addressed. Our findings suggest that designing gamified argumentation activities requires careful consideration of the degree of hypotheticality in learning contexts. In practice, attention should be given to arranging appropriate scaffolds and guidance across varying hypotheticality to foster higher-order scientific thinking.},

  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is widely recognized to be among the most essential skills for university graduates to successfully compete in the 21st century global economy; yet, much obscurity remains regarding its practical role in higher education. In fact, there is a need for an accepted educational plan with pedagogical guidelines that university instructors can lean on for integrating CT into subject instruction. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify the instructional design components recommended by instructors and students for promoting CT in higher education academic courses. The study involved ten higher education instructors and 342 undergraduate students in science and engineering. In order to address the research goal, the study followed the grounded theory approach in which the data was analyzed from a qualitative perspective. The data was collected through two research tools: semi-structured interviews and an online survey. The current study identified eight instructional design components for promoting CT. These components include four pedagogical practices: explicit teaching of CT, integration of digital tools, collaborative learning and constructing questions, as well as four modes of engagement: critical engagement with information, comparing approaches to problem-solving, guided inquiry and experimentation and raising doubts and evaluating credibility. The study introduces an adaptive model incorporating CT-enhanced pedagogical practices, for policymakers and instructional designers, to foster CT in science and engineering courses.},

In addition, a particular projection technique is introduced and analyzed in a coupling and mixed finite element form to assist in proving the optimal convergence properties. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate all theoretical results. The developed numerical method provides a guide to solve physical vibration problems of beams and thin plates, which own the form of nonlinear fourth-order wave equations, stably and accurately for a long time in a way that ensures energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Creativity requires both originality and effectiveness. Originality without effectiveness indicates pseudo-creativity, often due to deficits in idea evaluation. Research on the processes underlying pseudo-creativity and authentic creativity is limited. This study operationally identified individuals with pseudo-creative tendencies and compared them with authentically creative individuals using associative thinking tasks related to idea generation, focusing on memory search and semantic memory representations. In Experiment 1, moderation analysis classified participants into three groups based on multiple creativity measurements: authentic creativity, pseudo-creativity, and low creativity (control). These groups completed a goal-directed association task involving animal concept searching. Results showed that pseudo-creativity was associated with reduced clustering and cluster switching, along with more frequent hard switching. Experiment 2 constructed semantic networks for the three groups using free association, revealing that pseudo-creativity group exhibited a de-structured and hyperconnective semantic network. These findings provide the first characterization of the cognitive processes underlying pseudo-creativity. They reveal that pseudo-creativity exhibits looser conceptual boundaries and demonstrates differences from authentic creativity as early as the idea-generation phase. This offers a direct investigation for the theory that creativity requires a balance between the flexibility and rigidity of lexicon structure.},

The proposed estimator, leverages the robustness of correntropy-induced loss, combined with the nuclear norm penalty, to yield robust low-rank estimation. The robustness is controlled by the scale parameter which behaves similarly to the squared loss for small residuals and caps the effect of large residuals. Despite the nonconvex nature of the loss, we prove that the used estimation algorithm still enjoys global convergence and the proposed estimator achieves the best breakdown point of 1/2, and the desired non-asymptotic statistical rate is further derived under some regularity conditions. The theoretical results also indicate that the estimated rank is of the same order as the unknown true rank. Furthermore, we develop the adaptive nuclear norm (ANN) regularized estimator to better estimate the true rank. The global convergence of its estimation algorithm is also maintained though the objective function is entirely nonconvex. We derive the statistical rate for the ANN counterpart, and the theoretical results show that the estimated rank by ANN is closer to the true rank. Superior performance of the method proposed is demonstrated on both simulations and real-data analysis.},

We take into account the saturated treatment function while forming the model, incorporating three controls: awareness control, treatment control, and insecticide control. The intricate dynamics of the system, encompassing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as their biological feasibility, are thoroughly examined. The threshold parameter of the system, known as the basic reproduction number, is derived, along with the conditions for the occurrence of backward bifurcation and transcritical bifurcation. We also acquired the equilibria and their stability in relation to variations in the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both backward and transcritical bifurcations can be influenced simply by adjusting the cure rate efficiency and the potency of insecticide controls, which remain within our sphere of control. The analytical result is verified through some numerical work. Finally, we apply the genetic algorithm optimization technique, which is independent of the initial state of the population, to minimize the basic reproduction number by optimizing three control parameters and the cure rate. Optimizing the control parameters and cure rate, we have deduced that the disease will die out in the case of transcritical bifurcation, but it will remain in the population in an equilibrium state for the backward bifurcation.},

In this paper we execute fractal dimension (FD) concept for analyzing the complexity of stock indices. From different sectors, the closing price indices of stock indices BSESN, NYSE, NSE-Nifty and NASDAQ are chosen for the investigation and the outcome on research are exhibited on that wide-open convenient dataset associated with various kinds of stock indices data. Four notable assessment methods, namely Generalized fractal dimension (GFD), Katz’s Fractal dimension (KFD), Higuchi’s Fractal dimension (HFD) and Sevcik’s Fractal dimension (SFD) methods are examined in this investigation for the classification of complex stock data. The whole stock indices data is separated into subgroups with different sizing for the computation of fractal dimension which leads this research to the multifractal analysis. Anlaysis data set through subgroups with different size exhibits multifractal behavior. The whole data considered represents random walk for all the stock indices. The regarded exchange data of the indices are irregular and randomized in nature and authorize to employ fractal analysis. The results show that KFD method is more consistent than the results obtained by GFD, HFD and SFD methods.},

The related analysis for Laplace transforms is developed and it is used for UH stability. It is shown that the UH stability is equivalent to the convergence of the perturbed system toward the original system when the error of the perturbed source vanishes. Numerical methods based on UH stability are proposed. The analysis is investigated through some examples.},

A systematic analysis of the associated multiple orthogonality and biorthogonality relations, and an examination of the degrees of the Laurent polynomials is given. Recurrence relations, expressed in terms of banded matrices, are found. These recurrence relations lay the groundwork for corresponding Christoffel–Darboux kernels and relations, as well as for elucidating the ABC theorem. The paper also develops the theory of diagonal Christoffel and Geronimus perturbations of the matrix of measures. Christoffel formulas are found for both perturbations.},

  abstract = {We initiate the study of computational complexity of graph coverings, aka locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for graphs with semi-edges. The notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of local computations. In 1991, Abello, Fellows, and Stillwell asked for a classification of the computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges. Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering graph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem considerably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex mapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge mapping as well. We show some solvable cases and, in particular, completely characterize the complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs, even for bipartite ones. We remark that our new characterization results also strengthen previously known results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and they in turn apply to an infinite class of simple target graphs with at most two vertices of degree more than two. Some of the results are moreover proven in a more general setting (e.g., finding k-tuples of pairwise disjoint perfect matchings in regular graphs).},

  abstract = {The integration of 21st-century skills, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity (the 4Cs) is pivotal in contemporary higher education to prepare students for a rapidly evolving global landscape. Despite widespread theoretical emphasis, empirical insights into how these competencies are implemented in Vietnamese universities remain limited. This study aims to explore the extent of 4Cs integration in Vietnamese higher education and to identify lecturers' opinions on the instructional strategies used and the barriers encountered. To address this aim, a cross-sectional quantitative study using an adapted, validated survey was distributed electronically across multiple institutions in four major Vietnamese cities, employing a multi-stage institutional sampling approach. A total of 140 valid lecturer responses met the inclusion criteria, reflecting the accessible population during the data collection window. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviations) and internal-consistency estimates in SPSS 26. Descriptive analyses indicate widespread integration of the 4Cs, with lecturers most consistently employing structured collaboration and creativity strategies (e.g., group activities and granting student autonomy in resource selection). Conversely, project-based learning, collaborative online tasks, and the use of graphic organizers were reported as less consistently applied. Patterned differences across strategies highlight instructional and institutional barriers, including inadequate technological infrastructure, rigid curricula, and limited professional development opportunities. The results extend the existing literature by providing context-specific evidence on practice patterns and constraints, emphasizing the need for targeted institutional support to enable comprehensive implementation of the 4Cs. Implications include policy measures to enhance infrastructure, greater curriculum flexibility, and sustained professional learning to strengthen lecturers' capacity to embed 21st-century skills in teaching and learning.},

  abstract = {System dynamics provides a valuable framework for analyzing the complexities of a system over time. Using causal loop diagrams (CLDs), this study identifies two feedback mechanisms in the context of integrating computational thinking (CT) into education, focusing on leverage points such as coding-centric curricula and teacher competence development. The modeling shows how reinforcing and balancing feedback loops shape system behavior, demonstrating that interventions like coding-based approaches can deliver immediate benefits but risk hindering the long-term development of broader CT skills applicable to interdisciplinary problem-solving. The study enhances the analysis by uncovering patterns emerging from system dynamics, including the constraints limiting growth, reliance on symptomatic solutions, unintended consequences of quick fixes, and the prioritization of successful areas at the expense of others. These patterns highlight the importance of addressing foundational issues, such as teacher training and comprehensive curriculum design, to avoid overshadowing other critical goals of CT applications in interdisciplinary fields. By synthesizing CLDs, the study showcases the circular interactions between variables and the diverse dynamics influencing CT education, offering insights into potential scenarios and storylines for integrating CT into education systems.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a closed-loop symplectic regularized algorithm for constrained time-varying optimal control problems. Due to the limitations of symplectic methods in constrained time-varying systems, the optimal control problem is transformed and discretized into a discretized symplectic Runge–Kutta form by using variational integrator. Moreover, we derive first-order necessary conditions for the discrete optimal control problem and obtain a set of Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations. To solve the EL equations, we provide a forward–backward sweep iteration algorithm and analyze its error estimation along with regularization terms. Based on this iteration algorithm, a closed-loop symplectic regularized algorithm is proposed consisting of symplectic update and regularized iteration. To be specific, a sequence of quadratic programmings are leveraged in the forward stage of symplectic update to provide good initial values for the regularized iteration. Furthermore, an interior-point barrier function is applied to handle the constraints in the regularized iteration. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided, and simulations are conducted to verify its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the numerical performance of the parallel-in-time contour integral method for one-dimensional differential equations of convection–diffusion type. The considered method is based on the representation of a Dunford-Cauchy integral along a contour which encompasses the spectrum of an unbounded infinitesimal operator A corresponding to the equation. The discrete operator is constructed as a Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) discretization of diffusion and advective, resp. convective, terms. Its accuracy and performance as a part of the contour integration method is compared with those by finite difference approaches. A contour is chosen to be of elliptic shape with varying number of cubature points. Numerical performance of the contour integral method is compared with sequential-in-time realizations of the θ -scheme where discrete operators have similar discretizations by finite differences. The studied algorithm is 2 N time N cub parallelizable, where N time is the number of time points at which the numerical solution is computed and N cub is the number of cubature points on the contour. Its efficiency, however, strongly depends on the performance of the linear solver used for the resolvent part at each cubature point on the contour. In this work, we thoroughly examine the selection of a linear solver and analyze its performance with respect to various problem parameters. The proposed method is flexible in the choice of discretization techniques in space and can be readily extended to multiple dimensions.},

  abstract = {The synchronization research in time-varying networks serves as the foundation for further discussion of information transmission and node consensus. Moreover, changing topology and connection mode in a dynamic network, the time scale of opinion evolution, and an uncertain dynamic chaotic environment such as random noise and time delay are all important factors affecting individual opinion synchronization. Motivated by this observation, a multi-layer time-varying network model is built on the basis of complex multi-layer network, which can better capture the dynamic changes and evolutionary processes of real-world networks. At the same time, time delay of real system and multi-chaotic system are added in order to more realistically simulate the nonlinearity and complexity of social dynamic network systems. On the premise that the change rate of network topology is greater than the synchronization rate of nodes, network controllers and updating rules derived in this paper can effectively realize adaptive synchronization of multi-layer time-varying networks under a single chaotic system and a multi-chaotic system, respectively. These findings shed new light on the evolution of opinions on time-varying complex networks and help decision-makers predict the prevalence of hot topics and public opinions.},

This study investigates how design fiction pedagogy (DFP) may enhance K-12 AI education by fostering understanding of AI and encouraging critical thinking about its social impact. Grounded in constructivist and constructionist theories, DFP integrates speculative design and narrative learning to provide an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. The DFP model, which consists of seven pedagogical steps—researching a problem, designing a prototype, creating a future context, building a narrative, sharing with stakeholders, reflecting on ethical considerations, and evaluating and redesigning—was implemented through two separate week-long AI education camps in Ontario, Canada. Using a qualitative case study approach, we examined how DFP supports upper elementary students in grasping AI concepts and AI’s social impact. The findings indicate that, by integrating technical principles, ethical considerations, and futuristic thinking about human-AI interactions, DFP helps students develop a deeper understanding of AI while fostering creativity, critical thinking, and futuristic thinking—skills essential for the responsible development and use of AI. Consequently, DFP emerges as a promising approach for an AI education that integrates technical knowledge with ethical considerations.},

However, the factors shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward GenAI in creative collaboration have received limited attention, particularly in cross-cultural contexts. To address these gaps, this study has developed and validated an integrated theoretical framework via a hybrid multistage approach. First, focus group interviews (N = 15) informed the extension of the TAM-TPB model by incorporating perceived risk, openness to experience, and AI literacy. Then, cross-cultural survey data from China (N = 529) and the USA (N = 544) were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), multi-group analysis (MGA), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Results showed that subjective norm influenced user attitudes in both countries. In China, perceived usefulness and risk were key predictors, whereas in the USA, ease of use and openness to experience were more influential. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were found to be critical determinants of behavioral intentions across both groups. By integrating perspectives from creativity research, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for the adoption of GenAI in creative domains, informing educators, industry practitioners, and technology developers.},

Empirical results suggest that, in certain scenarios, the test outperforms existing specification tests by achieving a higher power and thereby offering greater sensitivity to deviations from the assumed parametric distribution family. Notably, the proposed test does not involve any hyperparameters and can easily be applied to individual datasets using the gofreg-package in R.},

This kind of preconditioner is defined as a two-level hybrid form, which falls into the class of “unsymmetrically weighted” Schwarz method based on the overlapping domain decomposition with impedance boundary subproblems. The coarse space in this preconditioner is constructed by specific eigenfunctions solving a series of generalized eigenvalue problems in the local discrete Maxwell-harmonic spaces according to a user-defined tolerance

                     . We establish a stability result for the considered discrete variational problem.

                        ρ

  abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in many real-world applications is selecting a limited number of representative points (RPs) that retain as much valuable information as possible from large datasets or continuous functions. Space-filling RPs (SFRPs) are commonly used to ensure comprehensive coverage of the input domain. However, in practical settings, it is equally important to achieve a well-distributed representation in both the input and response (output) spaces. This paper explores the advantages of input-output space-filling RPs (IOSFRPs), which are designed to ensure coverage across both domains. IOSFRPs are employed in three primary contexts: (i) Clustering, where they serve as cluster centers that promote well-distributed clusters across the input–response space; (ii) Modeling, where they act as experimental designs that capture variability in both domains, thereby improving the accuracy of surrogate models; and (iii) Estimation, where they function as efficient samples or discrete approximations of continuous distributions to enhance statistical inference. Extensive simulations and comparative evaluations demonstrate that IOSFRPs outperform widely used existing methods across all three applications. These findings highlight the flexibility, robustness, and efficiency of the IOSFRPs. Importantly, the weighting parameter allows for tuning the balance between input and output space-filling properties, enabling the IOSFRPs to adapt to a wide range of data-driven applications.},

Using a mixed-methods approach combining co-regulation coding and epistemic network analysis (ENA), this study compared the co-regulation processes and focus patterns of groups using ChatGPT with the Six Thinking Hats strategy versus those using Six Thinking Hats alone.

The findings showed significantly enhanced students' conceptual understanding (pretest = 5.34±2.29, posttest = 11.38±5.02, and t = -11.89), decreased misconceptions (from average pretest = 51.8% to posttest = 18.91%), and improved instructional practices of teachers.

We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By considering the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we study systems in which a lower-order term can act as a source of internal energy within the system. We apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by

                      and 5. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth to ensure numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We derive the analytic spectrum and find that it is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the analytic) is not obtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate the spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the numerical spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.},

This paper investigates the second-order tail asymptotics of discounted aggregate claims in continuous-time renewal risk models with constant interest force. By constructing a weighted Kesten-type inequality of second-order subexponential distributions, the second-order tail asymptotics for two types of continuous-time renewal risk models without and with by-claims are separately built. Compared with first-order tail asymptotics, our results are superior and more precise, as demonstrated by two numerical examples.},

To address this challenge, we propose two innovative neural networks: HNN and MwsbpHNN.
                  HNN is designed to converge to a least squares solution of the time-varying tensor polynomial systems, demonstrating its efficacy in handling dynamic data. MwsbpHNN takes this a step further by achieving fixed-time convergence, a significant advancement over existing methods, while simultaneously exhibiting noise tolerance, ensuring robust performance even in noisy environments. We derive rigorous upper bounds on the convergence time for MwsbpHNN, providing a theoretical foundation for its rapid and reliable operation.

Specifically, we compared the performance of expert (more than three years) and novice (less than four months) design students when reading different layout configurations of a product design plan. A total of 80 participants, 40 experts and 40 novices, were recruited from a Chinese university. Using a 2 (expertise: expert vs. novice) × 2 (layout: text-image proximity vs. text-image separation) experimental design, participants' recall, insight scores, visual attention distribution and visual attention transition were analyzed. Eye-tracking data revealed that experts allocated significantly more visual attention to images and exhibited more complex fixation transitions between images and texts, suggesting higher levels of critical engagement. In contrast, novices displayed a more linear reading pattern, particularly in layouts that separated images from texts. Correspondingly, experts outperformed novices in both recall and insight scores. Additionally, layout configurations had a more complex impact on visual attention and performance. In the second layout, fixation time on images showed a positive correlation with insight, and experts exhibited fixation transitions between images. The results provide valuable insights for design educators, emphasizing the need for tailored instructional strategies to foster critical thinking skills in students at different educational levels.},

  abstract = {Food browning during cooking often results from Maillard reaction, though other processes, such as caramelisation and enzymatic browning, also contribute depending on the type of food and cooking conditions. This paper presents a browning model based on Maillard reaction kinetics that integrates into comprehensive CFD baking models, predicting melanoidin concentration and food browning during baking. Initial validation uses data from established studies on the Maillard reaction and melanoidin formation in simplified model systems (sugar–amino acid mixtures heated under controlled conditions). Further experimental validation involves baking muffins in a domestic oven, comparing observed surface browning and melanoidin absorption with the model’s simulated browning index and melanoidins over time. A method for calculating the browning index from experiments and CFD simulations is presented. Validation shows differences in melanoidin concentration and browning index between measurements and simulations below 8% and 7%, respectively, across all baking times. This research provides insight into the mechanisms of browning reactions in baked goods, enabling the integration of Maillard reaction kinetics into CFD models. These findings offer practical tools for predicting browning, allowing the food industry to optimise baking processes, improve product consistency, and enhance safety and quality.},

  abstract = {Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) work in mathematics education are widely recognized for engaging students in cognitively demanding activities that foster Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), like critical thinking and reasoning. However, connections between design features, CPS processes, and learning outcomes remain complex and not fully understood. To address this, we applied a conjecture-based framework to systematically review 45 empirical studies published between 2010 and 2022, focusing on how specific task designs and CPS processes contribute to HOTS. We used a machine learning tool to prioritize relevant studies and streamline the selection process, ending after a threshold number of consecutive irrelevant articles. Guided by the conjecture-based framework, our analysis highlighted how cognitive processes in CPS function as essential mechanisms of learning and measurable outcomes. Specifically, design features, such as technology-supported exploratory tasks and open-ended problems, encourage reflective discourse and deeper cognitive engagement. We also found that structured group procedures, including clear roles and guided interaction protocols, improve collaboration. Nonetheless, challenges like miscommunication and uneven participation can limit CPS from fully realizing its potential to cultivate HOTS. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of aligning task design with CPS processes and using strategies to address collaboration barriers, particularly those related to communication. Without clear protocols and consistent dialogue, even well-designed CPS tasks can fail to cultivate HOTS. In conclusion, this review offers practical insights for educators and researchers implementing CPS effectively in mathematics education, highlighting that fostering open, structured communication is vital for optimizing both collaborative processes and the development of advanced cognitive skills.},

  abstract = {Creative problem-solving has been highly acknowledged as an important skill for students in the 21st century. While risk-taking tendency has been identified as an important factor for creative problem-solving performance, empirical findings regarding their relationships remain inconsistent – partly due to variations in conceptualizing and measuring creativity, as well as a general lack of consideration for contextual moderators. Drawing on Trait Activation Theory (TAT), the present study takes a tentative and exploratory approach to examining how perceived teacher support for creativity moderates the relationships between risk-taking tendency and four subskills of creative problem-solving (problem identification, information processing, idea generation, idea evaluation) among Chinese fourth graders. Using a computer-based interactive assessment to objectively measure the subskills, data from 1544 students suggested that risk-taking tendency positively predicted overall creative problem-solving performance. Furthermore, perceived teacher support appeared to play a moderating role, though this was observed primarily in the dimensions of idea generation and idea evaluation. The findings offer preliminary insights into how contextual factors may shape trait expression in creative processes, with implications for educators and parents to better support student creativity development.},

The poroelastic media is governed by the quasi-static Biot model, and the fluid flow in the fracture is governed by the reduced dimensional Darcy model. The two models are fully coupled by four interface conditions. A spatial discretization is constructed by combining different methods, the polyhedral weighted discontinuous Galerkin method for the quasi-static Biot model, and the continuous Galerkin finite element method for the reduced dimensional fracture model. We prove the existence and uniqueness, stability, a priori error estimates for the solution of semidiscrete and fully discrete formulation with the backward Euler scheme. Through numerical experiments, we verify the convergence order of the numerical method, design a comparative case to validate the model, test the robustness of the numerical method in solving the Biot–Darcy model with different permeability coefficients, fracture morphologies, and curved fracture, simulate hydraulic fracturing. The results demonstrate that the model we have investigated is valid, and our numerical method is robust enough to accurately simulate the coupling of geomechanics and fluid flow in fracture poroelastic media.},

  abstract = {Equipping English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) learners with critical thinking (CT) skills offers significant benefits for both their academic advancement and future careers. Due to its pivotal role in learners' lives, the pursuit of more effective interventions for developing CT skills among EFL learners remains ongoing. This study aims to examine how CT skills are fostered among EFL learners in higher education, as evidenced in published research. To achieve this, a secondary research method using the PRISMA systematic review framework was employed. The review systematically analyzed 47 published research articles selected from an initial search of 11,143 titles across eight online databases. The findings of the review are as follows. First, fostering CT skills in higher education has become a major concern among EFL educators and researchers in Asia. Second, the review highlights that both immersion and infusion approaches can effectively promote CT development, particularly when used in combination. Key strategies such as self-learning, discussion, and mentoring are central to these approaches, with a strong emphasis on collaborative learning and reflective practices. The duration of interventions plays a critical role: longer and more sustained programs tend to produce stronger outcomes. Additionally, the learning environment—whether traditional, web-based, or blended—impacts the effectiveness of CT interventions. Among these, blended learning consistently yields favorable results, suggesting that integrating in-class and online instruction is highly recommended. Finally, methodological factors generally enhance the outcomes of CT instruction. In contrast, personal factors (i.e., learner-related variables) can both support and hinder the development of CT skills, depending on context. Therefore, these factors may act as either enablers or inhibitors of CT skill acquisition under different conditions. This review proposes several educational implications to improve the cultivation of CT skills among EFL learners in higher education, focusing on instructional strategies, assessment methods, and learning resources.},

  abstract = {In recent times, the artificial intelligence (AI) based deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted much attention from researchers. The aforesaid tools provide best solutions in many real world applications. On the other hand, combining the aforementioned tools with the traditional and fractional calculus tools, significant results can be created for comprehensive analysis of many problems of real world phenomenon and engineering disciplines. Systems of differential equations play important roles in modeling various real world problems involving ordinary or fractional order derivatives. Keeping the mentioned importance in minds, this paper investigates a coupled system of fractional integro-differential equations for qualitative and computational analysis. Utilizing the well known conformable fractional derivative, sufficient results are developed to analyze the solution of the system for existence and uniqueness. The fixed point concepts are utilized to advances to the desired results. Stability results are deduced by using the concept of Ulam–Hyers. At the last section the numerical aspect are investigated of the problem by using RK-4 (Runge–Kutta of order four) method under the mentioned fractional derivative. Also, the mentioned DNNs techniques have used to analysis the considered problems from AI perspectives. To demonstrate our adopted results, some important real world examples are presented at the end. The Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm is used for classifications of various results including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), regression coefficient by taking a specified numbers of neuron and epoches. Various graphical illustrations for training, testing, validation and all data are presented.},

Additionally, a Lyapunov iterative method is explored as an alternative to circumvent complex mathematical derivations. The proposed methods significantly reduce computational complexity by enabling low-dimensional computations for each follower, contrasting with the high-dimensional computations required by previous approaches. To prevent divergence of the norm of the solution, even with a small number of followers, we introduce a new condition for the coefficient matrices of the original mean-field stochastic system and develop an incentive strategy to ensure a finite norm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and reliability of our algorithm by solving a large-scale set of SNMEs and confirming the linear convergence of the simplified Newton’s method.},

Indeed, enablers of creativity represent a dominant field in this regard. Based on “Confluence approaches”, the study chose 14,041 fourth graders from 309 primary schools from a city in the Central Region of China, all of which completed online questionnaires that looked into the individual enablers and social enablers of creativity in science. Results of the descriptive analysis of individual enablers showed that there was a decrease observed in students’ attitude toward science, interest in science, engagement in science learning, and career orientation toward science. While the LASSO and nomogram results indicated six common variables of social enablers including teachers’ concerns about students’ interests, individualized teaching, collaborative group teaching, the infrastructure of science, after-school service in science subjects, and parent engagement in daily life. These variables consistently emerged as pivotal when predicting the correlation between social and individual enablers of creativity in science. Teaching methods (individualized teaching, collaborative group teaching) were identified as the most influential social enablers on individual enablers of creativity in science. These findings provide valuable insight into what teachers, schools, and families should concentrate on to effectively support the expression and enhancement of student creativity in science.},

In this paper, the type of process that Werner is referring to is addressed. Two test cases are presented: that of metaphor comprehension, and that of metaphor production which, itself, is a prime example of creative thinking. The focus of the discussion of metaphor production is on the stages of incubation and illumination/insight. The use of a microgenetic procedure, via which metaphor production (creative thinking) is investigated in real time, focusing on ongoing experience while producing a metaphor, is promoted here.},

However, its influence on the retaliatory malevolent creativity of bystanders, another key group in social exclusion, remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to investigate how social exclusion, particularly when coupled with attacks from excluders or the excluded, shapes bystanders’ retaliatory malevolent creativity. Study 1 and Study 2 recruited 69 and 74 participants, respectively. In both studies, participants were randomly assigned into the social exclusion group or control group. The social exclusion group underwent two blocks of social exclusion manipulation, while the control group experienced two blocks of sham exclusion manipulation. Following each manipulation, participants completed a retaliatory malevolent creative ideation task (MCT) targeting the excluded in Study 1 and excluder in Study 2. Study 1 showed that, only in the second block, the exclusion group exhibited higher MCT performance (fluency, originality, and malevolence) targeting the excluded than the control group. In study 2, the excluded group demonstrated significantly higher MCT performance targeting excluder exclusively in the first block than the control group. This exclusion effect on bystander’s retaliatory malevolent creativity was not mediated by the bystander’s sympathy or aggression. These findings indicate that simply witnessing social exclusion may increase bystanders’ retaliatory malevolent creativity toward both excluder and the excluded. Notably, the timing of this effect varies depending on the target of the MCT task, and its underlying mechanisms may involve factors other than aggression or empathy such as moral disengagement.},

  abstract = {This study explores the nonlinear hemodynamics of ternary hybrid nanoparticles (THNPs) in a diverging, ciliated microtube, accounting for interfacial nanolayer effects, electromagnetic forces, and cilia-driven propulsion. A fractional second-grade fluid model captures memory-dependent viscoelastic behavior. The governing nonlinear equations are analytically solved via the Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM), yielding rapidly converging series solutions. Results show that the fractional parameter enhances axial velocity, while relaxation time impedes flow near the tube center. Lorentz forces boost flow rates, whereas Hall and ion-slip currents exert a dampening effect. Meanwhile, nanolayer interactions intensify wall shear stress but hinder thermal efficiency by reducing heat transfer. A comprehensive dataset derived from the HPM solution was used to train, test, and validate an artificial neural network using the Backpropagation Levenberg–Marquardt scheme (ANN-BPLMS), achieving high predictive accuracy (99.99% testing, 99.996% cross-validation). These insights have significant implications for magnetically guided drug delivery, artificial cilia systems, and nanoscale biomedical transport. By integrating fractional dynamics, electrokinetics, and interfacial physics, this work advances the modeling of complex physiological microflows.},

The framework dynamically integrates specialized agents, enabling the generation of summaries that excel in coherence, factual accuracy, and brevity. Evaluated on a dataset of 10 educational scenarios encompassing human-written narratives and AI-generated summaries, the MoA framework demonstrated a 15 % improvement in narrative coherence and a 12 % gain in factual accuracy compared to 20 state-of-the-art summarization models.
                  The framework’s educational application was tested through comparative analysis of human- and AI-generated summaries in both 50-word and 15-word formats. Results highlight that while AI-generated summaries excel in factual consistency, human summaries retain greater creativity and narrative depth. By iteratively refining outputs, the MoA framework approaches human-level performance in long-form summarization tasks, bridging the gap between human and AI capabilities.
                  This study contributes to text summarization research by introducing an adaptive multi-agent framework, conducting an in-depth analysis of humanAI differences in summarization, and demonstrating the potential of AIdriven tools to enhance creative writing and learning in educational settings.},

  abstract = {With the development of the applied discipline of commutative quaternions, the commutative quaternion equality constrained least squares (CQLSE) problem is gaining more and more attention as an effective tool. However, the knowledge gap in numerous CQLSE problems is now unresolved. This paper, by means of the complex representation matrix of a commutative quaternion matrix, first studies the QR decomposition and generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of commutative quaternion matrices, and gives the corresponding theorems and algorithms. In addition, the algorithms for solving the CQLSE problem based on QR decomposition and GSVD of commutative quaternion matrices are given in this paper. Finally, numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach, based on mesh refinement or parametric enrichment with polynomial degree adaption, for numerical solution of convection dominated equations with random input data. A parametric system emerged from an application of stochastic Galerkin approach is discretized by using symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method with upwinding for the convection term in the spatial domain. We derive a residual-based error estimator contributed by the error due to the SIPG discretization, the (generalized) polynomial chaos discretization in the stochastic space, and data oscillations. Then, the reliability of the proposed error estimator, an upper bound for the energy error up to a multiplicative constant, is shown. Moreover, to balance the errors stemmed from spatial and stochastic spaces, the truncation error emerged from Karhunen–Loève expansion is considered in the numerical simulations. Last, several benchmark examples including a random diffusivity parameter, a random convectivity parameter, random diffusivity/convectivity parameters, and a random (jump) discontinuous diffusivity parameter, are tested to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator.},

  abstract = {Considering environmental factors and global warming, the use and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems have become widespread. However, the integration of these PV systems into smart grids raises concerns regarding cybersecurity. Since PV systems rely on communication networks, remote monitoring, and grid-connected inverters, they exhibit a cyber–physical structure and are therefore vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyber threats targeting PV infrastructure can lead to system failures, energy theft, grid instability, and financial losses. While many studies focus on cyber-attack detection for PV system cybersecurity, this paper aims to design a cybersecure PV system by employing a novel chaos-based encryption method. Due to their unpredictable and highly sensitive nature, chaotic algorithms are utilized to ensure secure communication within PV systems. The encryption algorithm is derived from the incommensurate fractional analysis of the “strings around the Bardeen-AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence dark energy”, a cosmological system. Simulation results performed in MATLAB/Simulink confirm the effectiveness of the proposed encryption framework. The underlying pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) successfully passed all 15 standard NIST SP800-22 statistical tests, validating its strong statistical randomness and unpredictability. Furthermore, the encrypted signals consistently exhibit high information entropy (e.g., 
                        
                           
                              V

                      encrypted entropy = 5.3213 compared to actual entropy = 4.0931), indicating strong randomization and obscurity of original patterns.

  abstract = {Causal inference is a crucial framework in a variety of fields, such as economics, healthcare, and social science. In this context, data-driven machine learning models have become more popular for estimating the effects of treatments. One fundamental technique for causal inference is structural equation modeling (SEM), which makes it possible to estimate the relationships between variables. However, conventional SEM methods need help with the complexities of structural causal models (SCM) in real-world data, including latent confounders, nonlinear relationships, and challenges in accurately specifying model structures. These limitations could cause the interpretation or biased causal effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new proposed method combining the piecewise structural equation modeling (PSEM) with the backdoor criterion, named PSEMBC. The main innovation of PSEMBC is the estimation of causal effects with the use of a linear SCM model, which captures complex relationships and interactions in the data. We demonstrate the value of PSEMBC for precisely and reliably identifying the average treatment effect (ATE) in simulated and real-world datasets utilizing a comparative study with current causal inference approaches.},

We present an analysis of open schooling initiatives launched within the frame of the STE(A)M Learning Ecologies – SLEs Project. SLEs offer opportunities to promote creativity of both learners and stakeholders engaged through innovative pedagogical design and the delivery of original learning artefacts (learning products). We gathered and analyzed several forms of data reflecting learner and stakeholder engagement associated with these initiatives. They included two templates completed with stakeholder input (participatory pedagogical design template; participatory scenario development template), learning products delivered by students in each SLE, interviews with stakeholders and responses to open-ended questionnaire items. Our data analysis revealed four types of SLEs: (1) Learner-experience oriented, (2) Master-product oriented, (3) End-user oriented, and (4) Citizen-science oriented.
                  We present similarities and differences of the various types of SLE with regard to stakeholder synthesis (diversity), learning objectives, female participation, career opportunities, their potential for transformative change, challenges encountered, and sustainability aspects. Based on the typology of SLEs and their characteristics, we identified a series of recommendations for future research and policy to optimize investment in and impact of open schooling projects. These include a focus on small wins to scale up SLEs, distributed leadership to empower teachers and increase availability of learning resources and learner support, and using learning products to decentralize formative assessment in SLEs and promote constructive stakeholder dialogue.},

The default intensity and risk-free interest rate are assumed to be random and satisfy the CIR model. An analytical formula for the option price is derived using Fourier transform techniques. Based on this pricing formula, some models for the price of the underlying asset of option and for the default intensity of the option seller are calibrated and the model parameters are estimated. The implied volatilities corresponding to the theoretical prices of the option derived from the models are calculated and compared with the implied volatilities calculated from the option market prices.},

The study's hypotheses were analyzed and interpreted using the Process Macro program (for SPSS) developed by Hayes. The moderator variable effect of representational fluency was tested with Model 1, the moderator effect of the sub-dimensions of representational fluency was tested with Model 2, and the moderating effect of gender on the moderator variable was tested with Model 3. The study results show that representational fluency has a moderating role in the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. In addition, it was determined that this effect was not significant at different levels of representational fluency. However, only high representational fluency positively regulated the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. It was concluded that the "connection" dimension came to the fore in the moderating effect of representational fluency. Gender was a moderator variable affecting the moderating effect of representational fluency on the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. Theoretical explanations and implications related to the research results were shared.},

Next, we introduce the sub-mixed fractional GBM model as a better tool for stock price prediction. We then propose two investment strategies to reduce unsystematic risk, based on the investor’s wealth. The first strategy uses a mixed hedging approach, allowing investors to hedge their full position with the contract funds, leading to the European option price. The second strategy lets investors hedge only part of their risk, depending on their risk tolerance.},

  abstract = {Random number generators are extensively used in science. Generating pseudo-random numbers is the base for many data analysis techniques in computational statistics. This is the case, for instance, of most of the Bayesian methods, which are enabled by means of samplers such as the well-known Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis–Hastings. These classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers are designed to generate a sequence of numbers that, under certain conditions, converge to a sequence that behaves as if sampled from a user-defined target distribution. In general, the number of iterations required to reach such convergence is not deterministic. There are several statistical tests for identifying that convergence has not yet been achieved, but not for actually signaling convergence. The present work introduces an exact non-parametric sequential test for signaling the convergence of random number generators in general. The solution is derived in the light of the type I error probability spending approach.},

This method exhibits a spectral-like accuracy, with the free functions involved in the FCE form represented by polynomial bases or by non-polynomial bases of quasi-random sinusoidal functions. The FCE method offers a special advantage over traditional element-based methods for boundary value problems involving relative boundary conditions. A number of linear and nonlinear numerical examples in one and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the performance of the FCE method developed herein.},

Using a longitudinal design with formative and summative assessments, the study employed single and chain mediation models to analyze HOTSs development during a 9-session biological science course on photosynthesis, respiration and the food chain. The results revealed that S-HOTS indirectly promote C–HOTS through sequential mediation pathways, with stronger effects from chain mediators compared to direct effects. Notably, model construction and systematic thinking skills emerged as pivotal mediators, bridging early-developing HOTSs and later-developing HOTSs. These findings highlighted the importance of stepwise instructional strategies aligned with hierarchical skill evolution, offering empirical insights for designing curricula that foster the development of HOTSs in science education.},

In this paper, we introduce a dual–primal version of the newly developed PC-PDHG algorithm and extend its applicability to general bilinear saddle point problems, resulting in the generalized new prediction–correction dual–primal hybrid gradient (GNPC-DPHG) algorithm. In many instances, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations compared to the original algorithm, while only adding a small amount of computational cost per iteration, thereby enhancing the convergence rate. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous proof of the global convergence of the proposed GNPC-DPHG algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence compared to the original algorithm.},

The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the scattering problems considered as boundary value problems and present the result of the well-posedness of each boundary value problem by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop a Nyström method for numerically solving the boundary value problems considered, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nyström method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the convergence results of the Nyström method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nyström method.},

  abstract = {Histopolation, or interpolation on segments, is a mathematical technique used to approximate a function f over a given interval I = [ a , b ] by exploiting integral information over a set of subintervals of I . Unlike classical polynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations, histopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to classical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known Runge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced nodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous functions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict requirement of passing through all the given data points. This inherent flexibility can reduce the likelihood of oscillatory behavior using, for example, rational approximation operators. In this work, we introduce a C ∞ rational quasi-histopolation operator, for bounded (integrable) functions, which reconstruct a function by defeating both the Runge and Gibbs phenomena. A key element of our approach is to blend local histopolation polynomials on a few nodes using multinode Shepard functions as blending functions. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our method.},

In fact, for showing the quality of the numerical anti-reflective BCs, we compare various types of numerical BCs, including the anti-symmetric ones considered in the case of fractional differential problems for modeling reasons. More in detail, given important similarities between anti-symmetric and anti-reflective BCs, we compare them from the perspective of computational efficiency, by considering nontruncated and truncated versions, and also other standard numerical BCs such as periodic BCs or reflective/Neumann BCs. A short theoretical analysis and several numerical tests, tables, and visualizations are provided and critically discussed. The conclusion is that the truncated numerical anti-reflective BCs perform better, both in terms of low computational cost and accuracy.},

                  This study examined learning processes in the context of a Capstone program for undergraduate seniors enrolled in a health sciences-focused university. During their Capstone, students design a personalized final-year curriculum, engage in structured reflection, and publicly present their learning. Applying the curricular space model (Blasco, 2016) which incorporates the Japanese notion of ma, an intentional gap that facilitates learning, we explored the impact of the interplay between three curricular spaces (cognitive, autonomy, and reflection) on innovative and creative thinking in Capstone final presentations.
               
                  Method
                  Using reflexive thematic analysis and content analysis, we analyzed 74 presentation videos (15 % of Capstone presentations from 2017–2022), including 42 distinguished presentations and 32 randomly selected ones.
               
                  Results
                  Student presentations revealed six themes that shed light on the impact of curricular space on learning: (1) Humorous presentation of challenges, (2) Empathetic storytelling, (3) Pre- and post-capstone, (4) Truth statement, (5) Detailed critical incident, and (6) Acknowledgement as a mode of reflection. Content analysis revealed that three codes (“Unordinary,” “Vulnerability,” and “Sensory”) were highly connected to most other codes, highlighting these as centrally important learning phenomena, and further identified especially strong links between “Vulnerability” and “Authenticity.” No significant differences were identified between the distinguished and non-distinguished Capstone presentations.
               
                  Discussion
                  Our analysis revealed that personal growth and identity development were key learning outcomes in the Capstone presentations, which emerged through prioritizing reflective and imaginative spaces and expressed through creative, authentic self-representation.},

Grounded in the AIR model of epistemic thinking, the program focused on supporting teachers in promoting students’ evaluation Aims, evaluation Ideals (criteria), and Reliable evaluation processes (strategies) across the regular curriculum. Teachers collaboratively learned, designed, and taught evaluation activities that were intended to foster these elements. We report on the program’s initial implementation with seven junior high school teachers and their students (N = 118), who were assigned to intervention and control groups. Using a mixed-method design, we administered assessments of information source evaluation to teachers and students before and after the intervention. Qualitative data sources included teacher interviews, teacher reflections, classroom observations, and PD meeting transcripts. Following the PD, teachers’ critical evaluation competencies became more elaborate and explicit. All of the teachers integrated information source evaluation in their instruction and adapted or designed evaluation activities that were tailored to their disciplines. Teachers faced challenges related to the complexities of integrating evaluation instruction in disciplinary topics, metacognitive instruction, and curriculum structure. Following the PD, students increasingly used source evaluation criteria, but there were no changes in their evaluation strategies. These results demonstrate the potential of the PD model and identify challenges that may inform future PD initiatives.},

  abstract = {Creative thinking often requires overcoming habitual responses and forming remote associations, which may be supported or hindered by cognitive control. This study investigated how two components of inhibitory control—conflict detection and conflict inhibition—contribute to remote associative thinking under different types of experience constraints. Participants completed a Chinese Compound Remote Associates Task (CCAT) under three conditions (Non-Constrained, Perceptual-Constrained, and Semantic-Constrained), along with Flanker and Stroop tasks to measure distractor and prepotent response inhibition. Event-related potentials components (N200 and N450) and response time differences were used to assess conflict detection and inhibition, respectively. Both correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of these cognitive control processes on creative performance. The results showed that conflict inhibition consistently facilitated creative performance, while the effect of conflict detection varied across experience conditions: greater sensitivity to semantic conflict shortened response latency, whereas greater sensitivity to perceptual conflict reduced accuracy. These findings suggest that the role of inhibitory control in creativity is context-dependent and highlight the differentiated contributions of detection and inhibition in experience-constrained creative problem-solving.},

  abstract = {The landscape of signal processing has witnessed significant advancements over the years, driven by the need for efficient and accurate techniques to analyze and manipulate complex data. While traditional Fourier-based methods have been instrumental, they often struggle to capture the intricate nuances of signals that exhibit non-linearity, non-stationarity, or dual characteristics. To address these limitations, a novel approach namely the Discrete Biquaternion Linear Canonical Transform (DBiQLCT) is introduced in this paper. Because of the inherent non-commutativity of biquaternion algebra multiplication, the Discrete Biquaternion Linear Canonical Transform (DBiQLCT) has three unique forms: left-sided DBiQLCT, right-sided DBiQLCT, and two-sided DBiQLCT. We first introduce a notion of DBiQLCT and subsequently investigate the connections between these transformations. Following that, we investigate the two-sided discrete biquaternion linear canonical transform (TDBiQLCT), revealing important fundamental features such as linearity, time shift, conjugate, and modulation. We also establish the Plancherel and convolution theorems associated with the two-sided DBiQLCT. Furthermore, applications of the proposed transform are discussed at the end.},

Starting from the observed data obtained from such systems, we propose a novel framework that facilitates the investigation of parameter identification for multi-state systems governed by spatiotemporal varying parametric partial differential equations. Our framework consists of two integral components: a constrained self-adaptive physics-informed neural networks, encompassing a sub-network, and a finite mixture model with Gaussian components, as our methodology for parameter identification and change-point detection. Through our scheme, we can accurately estimate the unknown varying parameters of the complex multi-state system. Furthermore, we have showcased the efficacy of our framework on two numerical cases: the 1D Burgers’ equation with time-varying parameters and the 2D wave equation with a space-varying parameter.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a new fully-mixed finite element method for the coupled model arising from the Navier–Stokes equations, with variable viscosity, in an incompressible fluid, and the Darcy equations in an adjacent porous medium, so that suitable transmission conditions are considered on the corresponding interface. The approach is based on the introduction of the further unknowns in the fluid given by the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor, where the latter includes the respective diffusive and convective terms. The above allows the elimination from the system of the fluid pressure, which can be calculated later on via a postprocessing formula. In addition, the traces of the fluid velocity and the Darcy pressure become the Lagrange multipliers enforcing weakly the interface conditions. In this way, the resulting variational formulation is given by a nonlinear perturbation of a threefold saddle point operator equation, where the saddle-point in the middle of them is, in turn, perturbed. A fixed-point strategy along with the generalized Babuška-Brezzi theory, a related abstract result for perturbed saddle-point problems, the Banach-Nečas-Babuška theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem, are employed to prove the well-posedness of the continuous and Galerkin schemes. In particular, Raviart–Thomas and piecewise polynomial subspaces of the lowest degree for the domain unknowns, as well as continuous piecewise linear polynomials for the Lagrange multipliers on the interface, constitute a feasible choice of the finite element subspaces. Optimal error estimates and associated rates of convergence are then established. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the method in 2D and confirming the theoretical findings, are reported.},

Our findings showed that students were able to develop sophisticated “distributed creativity” and "augmented metacognition," enabling them to negotiate complex relationships between AI assistance and intellectual ownership. Rather than passive consumption, students demonstrated emerging AI literacy, whereby they were able to critically evaluate AI output, recognize its limitations while also maintain authorial control. These insights illuminate evidence-based strategies for fostering AI literacy while preserving academic integrity, enabling educators to responsibly harness GenAI's transformative potential.},

  abstract = {This survey presents a focused and conceptually distinct framework for understanding recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to emulate “slow thinking”, a deliberate, analytical mode of cognition analogous to System 2 in dual-process theory from cognitive psychology. While prior review works have surveyed reasoning LLMs through fragmented lenses, such as isolated technical paradigms (e.g., reinforcement learning or test-time scaling) or broad post-training taxonomies, this work uniquely integrates reinforcement learning and test-time scaling as synergistic mechanisms within a unified “slow thinking” paradigm. By synthesizing insights from over 200 studies, we identify three interdependent pillars that collectively enable advanced reasoning: (1) Test-time scaling, which dynamically allocates computational resources based on task complexity via search, adaptive computation, and verification; (2) Reinforcement learning, which refines reasoning trajectories through reward modeling, policy optimization, and self-improvement; and (3) Slow-thinking frameworks, which structure reasoning into stepwise, hierarchical, or hybrid processes such as long Chain-of-Thought and multi-agent deliberation. Unlike existing surveys, our framework is goal-oriented, centering on the cognitive objective of “slow thinking” as both a unifying principle and a design imperative. This perspective enables a systematic analysis of how diverse techniques converge toward human-like deep reasoning. The survey charts a trajectory toward next-generation LLMs that balance cognitive fidelity with computational efficiency, while also outlining key challenges and future directions. Advancing such reasoning capabilities is essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains including scientific discovery, autonomous agents, and complex decision support systems.},

The research was conducted through a randomised crossover experiment, with students alternating between AI-assisted and unaided ideation tasks. A mixed-methods approach combined quantitative analyses of the 728 ideas generated with a qualitative evaluation of students’ interactions with AI. Results show that the use of AI did not reduce fluency, flexibility, or originality, nor did it lead to thematic homogenisation. However, semantic divergence was significantly lower in the AI-assisted condition, suggesting convergence in the way ideas were formulated. Additionally, AI-assisted ideas more frequently resembled existing products and exhibited reduced textual elaboration. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA revealed that students who began with AI support produced more original and diverse ideas across both tasks, pointing to a lasting effect of early AI use. Qualitative analysis of student-AI interactions revealed important patterns, including predominantly passive and directive use, with limited exploratory or collaborative engagement. These findings provide new insights into human-AI co-creation and highlight the importance of promoting intentional, critical, and pedagogically guided use of generative AI tools in education.},

  abstract = {Modern design education requires innovative approaches to inspire and enhance creativity. Prior research suggests that cognitive stimulation levels significantly influence creative performance, with an optimal level known as the “sweet spot” effect. However, studies specifically addressing inexperienced designers remain limited. While mood boards are commonly used as visual stimuli in design processes, few studies, particularly in educational contexts, have explored the optimal level of stimulation. This gap may stem from challenges such as novice users’ limited expertise and the absence of refined instructional strategies. This controlled experiment aimed to explore whether an optimal level of stimulation exists in mood board design activities. Participants were classified into low-, moderate-, and high-constraint groups based on the degree of image involvement. The study employed the sweet spot framework, treating creativity level as the dependent variable and constraint level as the independent variable. Creativity in design sketches was evaluated across four dimensions: novelty, variety, quality, and quantity. Mood board effectiveness was subjectively assessed using three criteria: innovation, consistency, and visual attractiveness. The results indicated that the moderate-constraint group proved most effective in stimulating creativity across these four metrics. They also required less creation time than the high-constraint group. Moreover, moderately constrained mood boards demonstrated the largest number of significant positive correlations with sketch creativity. Furthermore, the study identified the characteristics of mood boards with low and high constraint levels. Based on these findings, this study proposes practical instructional strategies to foster creative education using mood boards.},

  abstract = {Association analysis of multivariate omics outcomes is challenging due to the high dimensionality and inter-correlation among outcome variables. In practice, the classic multi-univariate analysis approaches are commonly employed, utilizing linear regression models for each individual outcome followed by adjustments for multiplicity through control of the false discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise error rate (FWER). While straightforward, these multi-univariate methods overlook dependencies between outcome variables. This oversight leads to less accurate statistical inferences, characterized by lower power and an increased false discovery rate, ultimately resulting in reduced replicability across studies. Recently, advanced frequentist and Bayesian methods have been developed to account for these dependencies. However, these methods often pose significant computational challenges for researchers in the field. To bridge this gap, a computationally efficient autoregressive multivariate regression model is proposed that explicitly accounts for the dependence structure among outcome variables. Through extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the approach provides more accurate multivariate inferences than traditional methods and remains robust even under model misspecification. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to investigate whether the associations between serum lipidomics outcomes and Alzheimer’s disease differentiate in

  abstract = {In this study, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) combined with high-throughput computational screening to explore the magnetic and structural properties of full Heusler alloys with the general formula X₂YZ, aiming to identify promising candidates for rare-earth-free permanent magnet applications. A total of 360 distinct compounds were generated using 3d transition metals for X and Y, and main group elements for Z. After the initial filtration based on thermodynamic preference for tetragonal symmetry, 41 compounds were retained for further investigation. Among these, three compounds, Co2CrGe, Co2CrSi, and Co2FeGa, exhibited saturation magnetization values greater than 0.5 T. Dynamical stability revealed that Co2CrGe and Co2FeGa are dynamically stable, while Co2CrSi was excluded from further analysis. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MCA) calculations yielded values of 2.4 MJ/m3 for Co2CrGe and 3.1 MJ/m3 for Co2FeGa, corresponding to high anisotropy fields (

This study extends the cumulative past inaccuracy measure to a bivariate framework, addressing prediction errors in bivariate random processes while examining its properties in the absence of a known probability density function. Additionally, we introduce a conditionally weighted extension, the conditional weighted cumulative past inaccuracy measure, and explore its theoretical properties within conditionally specified models. When the probability density function is unknown, we adopt a nonparametric approach using kernel estimation techniques to approximate the measure effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed kernel estimator to ensure its reliability. To demonstrate the practical utility of the estimator, we provide a numerical illustration, showcasing its application in reliability and survival analysis.},

In this study, a pretest-posttest experimental design was employed, which was implemented over three months. The participants were split into control and experiment groups. The experimental group performed SAC tasks via structured debates on controversial issues, while the control group performed traditional speaking practices. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire regarding speaking anxiety, which was administered during the pre- and post-experiment phases. The results revealed that the SAC participants had significantly lower speaking anxiety and greater speaking confidence than the control group. The findings support the notion that SAC creates a safe and cooperative atmosphere that reduces anxiety, promotes engagement, and develops speaking ability. Furthermore, this study adds to the emerging research on innovative methods in language teaching practice and the notion that SAC not only enhances linguistic ability but also emotional autonomy and agency. The results have practical implications for teachers who are searching for an effective way to reduce communication apprehension of their foreign language learners in pursuit of more confident and competent speakers.},

However, this is a topic that has yet to receive much attention in the post-Soviet context and more specifically Kazakhstan. Currently, there is little international evidence of research on upper-secondary school teachers’ beliefs about creativity. Thus, the aim of the study was to explore how these teachers conceptualize a creative learning environment, including their beliefs about what constitutes such an environment, and how creativity can be developed in the classroom. The research was designed as a qualitative, multiple-case study comprising four different types of Kazakhstani secondary schools. Data collection included 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews. A modified conceptual framework for teachers’ beliefs about creativity (Bereczki & Kárpáti, 2018) was employed in this study. The findings revealed that teachers’ beliefs about developing a creative environment align with many empirical findings worldwide. However, a noteworthy finding of this study was that the creative environment construct of this study’s initial conceptual framework was expanded with an additional subconstruct: students’ needs. Unique to this study was that participants believe a creative environment cannot be fully effective if students’ needs (basic and psychological) are not met and if the physical environment is unsatisfactory.},

However, empirical studies on CT skill cultivation in GenAI-assisted learning are limited, especially in prevalent multimodal contexts. Integrating the CT skill framework and visual grammar, this qualitative case study developed a teaching module to foster undergraduates’ CT skills in GenAI-assisted digital multimodal composing (DMC), focusing on non-proficient AI users. It further explored four groups’ learning experiences in the classroom through students’ GenAI-assisted PowerPoint products, reflective writings, interviews, and design process observation. The findings revealed students’ more thoughtful scrutiny, comprehensive evaluation, and selective adoption of multimodal AIGC to achieve communicative purposes, with group variations and limitations in each dimension. This progress was facilitated by collaborative, revision-based DMC classwork with specifically defined, multi-dimensional requirements, systematic framework teaching, and real-time scaffolding. In conclusion, collaborative GenAI-assisted DMC practice with systematic instructional support can significantly foster students’ CT skill cultivation. These findings illuminate future pedagogical innovations to encourage deep learning and higher-order cognitive skills among a broader range of students in GenAI-assisted multimodal contexts.},

It spanned 14 weeks, with one 100-min session per week, in which ten activities were introduced. Results: The intervention program has achieved a significant development of creativity in all intervention groups, being especially relevant in one of them. The importance of sociodemographic variables, gender and age, was studied. Gender differences in creativity were not detected, neither in relation to age or academic performance of the students which suggest the need for further research in this direction.

However, the existing single-indicator evaluation system struggles to accurately distinguish between different levels of ability, highlighting the urgent need for a scientific and multidimensional evaluation system. In this study, the AHP-TOPSIS method was adopted. Combined with the grades of programming-related courses and competition results, a multi-dimensional evaluation system for programming design ability was constructed, and a comprehensive score was given to 307 students. The results show that the weight of mathematical analysis ability is the highest (0.26), highlighting its core position in programming education. Furthermore, the comprehensive scores of students follow a normal distribution. 68 % of the students' scores are concentrated between 70 and 79 points, which can effectively distinguish students of different ability levels. Further analysis indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between course grades and competition grades (Pearson's r = 0.78), emphasizing the importance of a solid course foundation for the development of programming ability. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the comprehensive score between genders (p = 0.22, Cohen's d = -0.15), indicating that programming education should focus on individual differences rather than gender. The evaluation system proposed in this paper not only provides scientific assessment tools for educational institutions, but also offers a basis for optimizing teaching strategies, improving teaching quality and the quality of talent cultivation, which is of great significance to the reform and innovation of computer education.},

In the current study, we thus examined the impact of gender and SES on creative thinking across 62 countries, using data from the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Creative thinking, alongside mathematics and reading, was analyzed using a two-stage meta-analytic approach, integrating effect sizes from country-specific samples with a total sample size of N = 493,660. Our results revealed consistent gender disparities, with females outperforming males in creative thinking and reading, a trend robust across countries but with considerable variability. Gender disparities were less pronounced in the mathematical domain. Moreover, SES was found to be a strong predictor of creative thinking, mathematics, and reading, with higher SES associated with better performance across all domains. There was no substantial interaction effect between gender and SES for creative thinking and reading, suggesting that SES advantages are consistent across genders. Our analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity between countries, emphasizing the need for context-specific educational policies. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of gender and SES on fundamental educational outcomes and hence stress the necessity of tailored interventions to address these disparities around the globe.},

The participants were asked to construct problems from the narrative text “The Cure for Unhappiness” as a pre- and post-test. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants to determine their thoughts on problem-posing. The Wilcoxon Ranked Signs test was conducted to determine the statistically significant increase in the mathematics content strand, type, and total number of problems that the teachers constructed in the post-test compared to the pre-test. The semi-structured interviews with the teachers were analyzed with descriptive analysis. The training on narrative-text-based problem-posing given to the teachers was found to increase their non-routine problem-posing skills, although there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of problems posed by the teachers and the number of routine problems they posed. The teachers, who stated that they were inadequate in problem-posing before the training, stated that the problem-posing training using narrative texts increased their problem-posing awareness.},

Unlike previous results that describe the Euclidean and Hermitian duals of MP codes only under specific assumptions on the defining matrix, our characterization applies to MP codes with defining matrices that are not necessarily square nor of full row rank. Moreover, we consider the more general framework of Galois duals, with Euclidean and Hermitian duals treated as special cases. To demonstrate the theoretical results, several numerical examples of MP codes with best-known parameters are provided.},

Two complementary methods are introduced: the exponential time differencing multistep Padé (ETD-MS-Padé) scheme and the implicit multistep Padé (ETD-IMS-Padé) scheme, which together form a predictor–corrector approach. By combining ETD-based multistep temporal discretization with finite difference spatial discretization, the proposed methods achieve temporal accuracy of order

  abstract = {Sediment suspension and motion due to vessel traffic in navigation channels is a challenging problem in the design and management of waterways, ports and navigation channels. This study utilised computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to investigate the impact of vessel motion on bed morphology and sediment suspension. The work was carried out for a navigation channel with sloped banks, subject to motion-induced currents and waves generated by a rectangular barge with a blunt bow, towed at constant speed. A fine sand channel bottom was modelled. The simulations, consisting of six different scenarios with two bank slope angles, two tow speeds and two vessel widths, have been carried out by FLOW-3D Hydro software. It was found out that the most significant parameter affecting sediment motion is the tow speed of the vessel, which is coupled with the vessels squat. The study further shows that ship width also plays a critical role in predicting the risk of sediment accumulation in harbour and navigation channel projects, as an increase of only 15 % in vessel width results in a large increase of 72 % in the total amount of suspended sediment. An increase in bank slopes, on the other hand, is found to have a smaller effect (15 %) on the total suspended sediment concentration.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we propose newly-derived exponential quadrature rules for stiff linear differential equations with time-dependent fractional sources in the form h ( t r ) , with 0 < r < 1 and h a sufficiently smooth function. To construct the methods, the source term is interpolated at ν collocation points by a suitable non-polynomial function, yielding to time marching schemes that we call Exponential Quadrature Rules for Fractional sources (EQRF ν ). We write the integrators in terms of special instances of the Mittag–Leffler functions that we call fractional φ functions. We perform the error analysis of the schemes in the abstract framework of strongly continuous semigroups. Compared to classical exponential quadrature rules, which in our case of interest converge with order 1 + r at most, we prove that the new methods may reach order 1 + ν r for proper choices of the collocation points. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the theoretical findings and highlight the effectiveness of the approach.},

                  Minbar polygons and the non-rectilinear generalization of them may seem to be very restricted polygon classes but they form an adjacent pair where the multiple anchored watchman routes problem has a polynomial time solution in one class but is NP-hard in the slightly more generalized class. It is this property that motivates our study of these restricted polygon classes.},

Immersed finite element basis functions are constructed based on the triangular surface finite element. The advantage of the proposed method is that it allows interface across triangular elements, thereby avoiding the generation of complex fitted meshes on surfaces. Error estimates are derived for both the semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes of the proposed method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Analysis of covariance is a crucial method for improving precision of statistical tests for factor effects in randomized experiments. However, existing solutions suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are not suitable for ordinal data (as endpoints or explanatory variables); (ii) they require semiparametric model assumptions; (iii) they are inapplicable to small data scenarios due to often poor type-I error control; or (iv) they provide only approximate testing procedures and (asymptotically) exact test are missing. A resampling approach to the NANCOVA framework is investigated. NANCOVA is a fully nonparametric model based on relative effects that allows for an arbitrary number of covariates and groups, where both outcome variable (endpoint) and covariates can be metric or ordinal. Novel NANCOVA tests and a nonparametric competitor test without covariate adjustment were evaluated in extensive simulations. Unlike approximate tests in the NANCOVA framework, the proposed resampling version showed good performance in small sample scenarios and maintained the nominal type-I error well. Resampling NANCOVA also provided consistently high power: up to 26 % higher than the test without covariate adjustment in a small sample scenario with 4 groups and two covariates. Moreover, it is shown that resampling NANCOVA provides an asymptotically exact testing procedure, which makes it the first one with good finite sample performance in the present NANCOVA framework. In summary, resampling NANCOVA can be considered a viable tool for analysis of covariance overcoming issues (i) - (iv).},

A relationship betweem the Caputo-type and Riemann-type forms of the derivative is established and its corresponding Sawi transform is rigorously derived. This formulation unifies several known fractal-fractional derivative under a single framework, including Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio, Atangana–Baleanu and generalized Hattaf derivatives, all with non-singular kernels.
                  The Laplace transform of the proposed fractal-fractional derivative is also derived. Furthermore, the associated integral operators are studied using both the Sawi transform and Laplace transform techniques. As an application, the modified Gompertz growht model is reformulated using the Caputo–Fabrizio fractal-fractional derivative and solutions are obtained analytically using Sawi transform and Laplace transform as well as numerically.
                  To validate the analytical results, a numerical scheme based on a two-step Lagrange’s interpolation method is developed. An error analysis is carried out for various parameter values, using the numerical solution as the reference. A comparative analysis of the Sawi transform, Laplace transform and numerical method is conducted to assess their consistency, accuracy and efficiency in solving fractal-fractional gompertz model.},

  abstract = {The rapid integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education presents both opportunities and challenges in fostering critical questioning – a skill essential for critical thinking and AI literacy. In the context of GenAI, critical questioning refers to the ability to question, probe, and critically assess information generated by GenAI that will equip students with the discernment necessary in a digital world. However, there is limited research on how students develop and apply critical questioning when interacting with GenAI. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the pedagogical and contextual conditions that support high school students in critical questioning with GenAI. Through an action research study situated in a Grade 10 English classroom, the study examines the key conditions that facilitated students’ critical questioning with GenAI. Ethnographic methods were used to generate data from classroom observations, interviews, and student chatlogs that captured how students engaged with GenAI in situ within the classroom environment. A prior critical questioning framework was modified and used to identify instances of critical questioning with GenAI in the data, which were coded along the dimensions of context, delivery, and competency. Findings highlight how the instructional design of AI-mediated interactions, role of the teacher, students’ knowledge and disposition, and the delivery of GenAI platform were crucial in shaping the quality and depth of students’ questioning. These findings indicate that the success of critical engagement with GenAI does not rest on its technological capabilities alone, but on the specific pedagogical and classroom conditions that enable students to use it purposefully and reflectively. By extending our understanding of critical questioning in AI-mediated learning environments, this study provides insights into the conditions that foster AI literacy, which can lead to students actively and critically engaging with AI-generated content rather than passively consuming it.},

  abstract = {Crude oil is a highly strategic global resource, and price fluctuations significantly impact nearly all economic sectors. Therefore, accurate forecasting of its prices is essential for better financial stability and decision-making. This study aims to develop a robust model using monthly data from April 2004 to January 2024 to predict the price of crude oil. We propose a novel approach that blends ARIMAX and LSTM models using a weighted combination to leverage the strengths of econometric and machine learning methods. Unlike hybrid models, which are solely designed based on a decomposition-optimization structure, in our model, an explicit ensemble with weights via grid searching is used to enhance the model’s flexibility and performance. As ARIMAX is more efficient in dealing with linear relationships and exogenous variables, LSTM performs much better and effectively captures nonlinear patterns and long-range dependence. Weight hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation help reduce the risk of overfitting or underfitting in the model. Our empirical results indicate that the LSTM model provides a powerful forecasting baseline. The weighted ensemble model offers a marginal improvement on the chronological test set, and the Diebold-Mariano test confirms this advantage is statistically significant. Cross-validation reveals the standalone LSTM to be highly robust, highlighting the importance of component model selection. This study contributes to a more sophisticated framework for risk assessment in energy policy by revealing the crucial trade-off between a model's period-specific accuracy and its general robustness.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a nonlocal size-modified Poisson–Boltzmann (NSMPB) model and an efficient finite element iterative solver for proteins with three-dimensional molecular structures in ionic solutions containing multiple ion species. This model is the first Poisson–Boltzmann variant to simultaneously account for both nonlocal dielectric correlations and ionic size effects. The solver is constructed from a novel solution decomposition to overcome the numerical difficulties caused by the strong singularity, nonlinearity, and nonlocality of the model. It features an efficient modified Newton iterative method, an effective damping parameter selection scheme, and two good initial iteration strategies. To facilitate and streamline protein simulations, the solver is implemented as a software package that integrates a mesh generation tool, a protein data bank file retrieval program, and the PDB2PQR package. Numerical experiments involving an ionic solution with four species, three proteins with up to 11,439 atoms, and irregular interface-fitted tetrahedral meshes with up to 1,188,840 vertices demonstrate the fast convergence of the modified Newton iterative method, the efficiency of the solver, and the high performance of the package. This package provides a valuable tool for protein simulations.},

To further improve convergence, we incorporate momentum acceleration and preconditioning techniques. Numerical experiments on anisotropic diffusion equations demonstrate that the proposed solvers achieve faster convergence and lower computational complexity compared to both the Chebyshev iterative method with optimal weights and the Chebyshev semi-iteration method. To mitigate the strong dependence of the aforementioned single-level neural solvers on partial differential equation parameters and grid resolution, we integrate them into two recently developed multi-level neural solver frameworks. Accordingly, we develop two specialized solvers: Richardson(
                        m

  abstract = {This article examines the mechanisms by which creativity training enhances creative abilities and confidence. An extensive creativity training program (5 months of weekly training for almost seven hundred participants aged 10-17, assigned to the intervention and control group) was used to examine two alternative hypotheses. The first predicted that the increase in creative confidence due to training is mediated by the rise in creative abilities: the abilities-shape-confidence-effect. An alternative hypothesis posited that the increase in creative abilities due to training is mediated by the rise in creative confidence: the to-believe-is-to-rise effect. Although both these effects occurred, the change in participants’ creative abilities fully mediated their growth in creative confidence. This pattern suggests metacognitive mechanisms through which creativity training works. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of those results and provide recommendations for creativity training.},

  abstract = {The newly introduced higher education curriculum focuses on skill-oriented instruction, encouraging students to engage in design-driven tasks. Despite the potential of the curriculum, its implementation faces challenges, particularly in integrating cost-effective pedagogical approaches to foster cognitive dispositions such as metacognition, creativity, and design thinking. This study investigates the effectiveness of peer and individual support mechanisms, alongside emerging AI technologies, in addressing these challenges. Specifically, it examines how these supports enhance students’ cognitive dispositions within the context of design education. The study adopts a quasi-experimental research design involving 142 undergraduate students enrolled in design-related courses. Participants are divided into groups receiving peer support, individual support, or a combination of these, with or without AI assistance. Data collection includes reflective journals, creative design tasks, and design artefacts, which are analysed using epistemic network analysis and MANOVA. Results show that peer support significantly enhances collaborative metacognitive strategies, creativity, and design thinking compared to individual support. The integration of AI provides additional support, with more potent effects in peer support groups. However, AI does not improve students' design thinking in either peer or individual support mechanisms. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional support mechanisms with AI to enhance cognitive dispositions in design education and offer a scalable solution for addressing curriculum implementation challenges while equipping students with critical 21st-century skills.},

  abstract = {Scholars have put a lot of emphasis on time-varying linear matrix equations (LMEs) problems because of its importance in science and engineering. The problem of determining the time-varying LME’s minimum-norm least-squares solution (MLLE) is therefore tackled in this work. This is achieved by the use of NHZNN, a recently developed neutrosophic logic/fuzzy adaptive high-order zeroing neural network technique. The NHZNN is an advancement on the conventional zeroing neural network (ZNN) technique, which has shown great promise in solving time-varying tasks. To address the MLLE task for arbitrary-dimensional time-varying matrices, three novel ZNN models are presented. The models perform exceptionally well, as demonstrated by two simulation studies and two real-world applications to acoustic source tracking.},

This paper establishes new properties of the Anti-Gauss Laguerre polynomials, and analyzes some “truncated” interpolation processes essentially based on their zeros. Estimates of the corresponding Lebesgue constants are proved, and error bounds in spaces of locally continuous functions, equipped with uniform weighted norms are given. Finally, some numerical tests are presented about the behavior of the Lebesgue functions and Lebesgue constants, and numerical experiments dealing with the approximation of functions having different smoothness are proposed. Comparisons with the results achieved by truncated Lagrange interpolation processes based on Laguerre zeros are shown.},

The proposed method is of the Nyström type and leverages a cubature rule based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation, with the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) technique used to select the optimal RBF shape parameter. The convergence of the method is proven in the space of continuous functions. Finally, numerical tests demonstrate the performance of the method for various RBF choices and provide direct comparisons with other RBF-based techniques for FIEs available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Recovery and forecast of network traffic data from incomplete observed data is an important issue in internet engineering and management. In this paper, by fully considering the temporal stability and periodicity features in internet traffic data, a novel optimization model for internet data recovery and forecast is proposed, which is based upon the newly introduced higher-order tensor decomposition form called tubal tensor train (TTT) decomposition. Moreover, by introducing auxiliary variables and penalty techniques, a relaxation of the proposed model is obtained. Then, an easy-to-operate and effective algorithm for solving the relaxation model is proposed. We prove that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the established relaxation model. A series of numerical experiments about the recovery of structurally missing traffic data and the traffic data prediction on the widely used real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach have favorable performance than some state-of-the-art tensor/matrix based approaches.},

  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is a key education goal internationally, and enables people to navigate the growing amount of information and make informed decisions on increasingly complex issues. The term CT is frequently used in educational policy documents and curricula, and teachers play a key role in delivering effective CT instruction. Studies indicate that although teachers recognize the importance of CT, many lack an understanding of what CT really means, and feel unprepared to teach CT. Further research is needed to obtain a deeper understanding of what CT in primary school implies. As teachers tend to teach in accordance with their perception of CT, it is important to gain an insight into how teachers understand CT. This exploratory qualitative study investigates how a group of Norwegian primary school teachers (n = 56) perceive the concept of CT, both in general and in their teaching. Using reflexive thematic analysis of reflection notes (n = 56) and semi-structured group interviews (n = 15), we found that skills are emphasized more than dispositions. Teachers primarily have a skills-disposition view of CT, with limited attention to its social dimensions. Dispositions seem to be excluded from their views of CT in relation to teaching, which is considered problematic, as dispositions can be seen as the driving force for CT. As an educational implication of our study, we can conclude that there is a need for professional development for teachers to be aware of the necessity of teaching dispositions as well as skills, and for them to include the social aspects of CT.},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning is important for assisting students in knowledge understanding and knowledge co-construction. Many studies use concept maps, a visualized tool, to aid in this process. It is crucial to look into the ways that groups of three or more people construct knowledge and to combine implicit physiological data with explicit data. In this study, we combined content analysis, ordered network analysis (ONA), and hyperscanning technology based on electroencephalograms (EEG) to analyze the data of 28 triads of high- and low-achievement groups that participated in collaborative concept mapping tasks. The frequency statistics showed that the low-achievement groups have significantly higher monitoring and adapting behavior frequencies at the individual level in the regulation dimension than the high-achievement groups. The ONA results further illustrated the sequence of knowledge transfer based on the frequency analysis. The cognitive patterns of high-achievement groups showed a cycle that began at the group level of cognition, moved to the peer level of cognition, then to the group level of regulation, and ultimately returned to the group level of cognition. The low-achievement groups' cognitive patterns also exhibited directionality, moving from the group level of regulation to the individual level of cognition and to the group level of cognition. From the implicit perspective, the theta band and temporal-parietal regions showed greater inter-brain synchrony in the high-achievement groups. Low-achievement groups, on the other hand, had comparatively lower synchrony. Their consensus was only superficial and concentrated on ensuring that everyone participated through regulation and thought integration to finish the task. Our study's findings can help teachers and instructional designers develop tailored interventions based on differences in learners' cognitive patterns during collaborative concept mapping tasks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel discrete-time fractional-order Hopfield neural network (DTHNN) designed for generating and controlling chaotic attractors with a high complexity. The proposed DTHNN is constructed based on the Caputo-delta discrete fractional operator. Furthermore, the stability of the DTHNN’s equilibrium points is analyzed using the stability theory of discrete-time fractional-order systems. The incorporation of fractional order introduces nonlinear dynamics, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to exhibit complex chaotic behavior. The suggested model is explored using various classical numerical tools, including bifurcation diagrams, maximum Lyapunov exponent spectrum, and phase plots. The findings reveal that the new discrete neural network model has a wide range of dynamical behaviors. It can exhibit numerous observed dynamical behaviors, such as periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. The complexity of the fractional system is measured using the

Additionally, the multistability of the Hopfield neural network is investigated through the coexistence of attractors using different initial conditions. Furthermore, a robust nonlinear control laws for both stabilization and synchronization to control chaotic dynamics in the proposed system are performed. It is observed that the state variables can be stabilized to the origin under the constructed control law with fractional order. In our practical application, the proposed synchronization scheme is applied to ensure secure communication.},

The research, exploratory in nature, involved 6th-grade students in a computer science class engaging with real-world problems through Scratch. Screen recordings and interviews were used to examine the students’ ways of demonstrating abstraction. The findings showed that real-world problem contexts, combined with the features of Scratch as a block-based programming platform, supported the emergence of abstraction behaviors in problem solving process. Among the indicators of abstraction, "eliminating unnecessary blocks" and "finding clear and practical solutions" were the observed most frequently. The "applying previous solutions" has developed slightly less. These indicators of abstraction were demonstrated within the affordances of Scratch, particularly through its support for suggesting the necessity of blocks, reflecting on the complexity of solutions, presenting efficient alternative blocks, and structuring the solution for better interpretability. The results indicate that working with problems based on real-life contexts in block-based programming platforms may offer students rich opportunities to demonstrate abstraction in diverse ways through meaningful problem-solving. We hope this study will support more effective programming instruction on block-based platforms through the use of real-world problems.},

  abstract = {The problem of breakpoint detection is considered within a regression modeling framework. A novel method, the max-EM algorithm, is introduced, combining a constrained Hidden Markov Model with the Classification-EM algorithm. This algorithm has linear complexity and provides accurate detection of breakpoints and estimation of parameters. A theoretical result is derived, showing that the likelihood of the data, as a function of the regression parameters and the breakpoints location, increases at each step of the algorithm. Two initialization methods for the breakpoints location are also presented to address local maxima issues. Finally, a statistical test in the one breakpoint situation is developed. Simulation experiments based on linear, logistic, Poisson and Accelerated Failure Time regression models show that the final method that includes the initialization procedure and the max-EM algorithm has a strong performance both in terms of parameters estimation and breakpoints detection. The statistical test is also evaluated and exhibits a correct rejection rate under the null hypothesis and a strong power under various alternatives. Two real dataset are analyzed, the UCI bike sharing and the health disease data, where the interest of the method to detect heterogeneity in the distribution of the data is illustrated.},

However, if the function has jump discontinuities, we observe that the Gibbs phenomenon appears when approximating near discontinuities. In this paper, we present nonlinear modifications of such a spline, based on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) techniques to avoid this phenomenon near discontinuities and, at the same time, maintain the fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions. We also provide some numerical and graphical tests confirming the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Detection of glaucoma progression is crucial to managing patients, permitting individualized care plans and treatment. It is a challenging task requiring the assessment of structural changes to the optic nerve head and functional changes based on visual field testing. Artificial intelligence, especially deep learning techniques, has shown promising results in many applications, including glaucoma diagnosis. This paper proposes a two-stage computational learning pipeline for detecting glaucoma progression using only fundus photographs. In the first stage, a deep learning model takes a time series of fundus photographs as input and outputs a vector of predictions where each element represents the overall rate of change in visual field (VF) sensitivity values for a sector (region) of the optic nerve head (ONH). We implemented two deep learning models—ResNet50 and InceptionResNetV2—for this stage. In the second stage, a binary classifier (weighted logistic regression) takes the predicted vector as input to detect progression. We also propose a novel method for constructing annotated datasets from temporal sequences of clinical fundus photographs and corresponding VF data suitable for machine learning. Each dataset element comprises a temporal sequence of photographs together with a vector-valued label. The label is derived by computing the pointwise linear regression of VF sensitivity values at each VF test location, mapping these locations to eight ONH sectors, and assigning the overall rate of change in each sector to one of the elements of the vector. We used a retrospective clinical dataset with 82 patients collected at multiple timepoints over five years in our experiments. The InceptionResNetV2-based implementation yielded the best performance, achieving detection accuracies of 97.28 ± 1.10 % for unseen test data (i.e., each dataset element is unseen but originates from the same set of patients appearing in the training dataset), and 87.50 ± 0.70 % for test data from unseen patients (training and testing patients are entirely different). The testing throughput was 11.60 ms per patient. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for detecting glaucoma progression from fundus photographs.},

  abstract = {Potential theory provides rigorous solutions to geodetic boundary value problems involving Laplace’s equation, often expressed through global integral transformations. However, the practical application of these solutions is hindered by the incomplete availability of high-resolution gravity data. This limitation necessitates the separate evaluation of far-zone contributions—commonly referred to as truncation errors. These errors are typically characterized using truncation coefficients, whose computation via recurrence formulas becomes numerically unstable at high altitudes and degrees when using double precision. This study presents a robust and comprehensive method for accurately computing truncation coefficients for the Poisson, Hotine, and Stokes integrals across all degrees and altitudes. The proposed approach integrates three specialized strategies: (1) an asymptotic expansion for high-degree terms to ensure both accuracy and efficiency; (2) a two-regime altitude model for low-degree terms, with binomial expansions applied at low altitudes and stabilized recurrence series used at high altitudes; and (3) double-precision numerical experiments that validate the method, showing relative errors below 10−5 for the Poisson integral and below 10−8 for the Hotine and Stokes integrals. These results demonstrate that the method is both accurate and reliable for geodetic applications at all altitudes—from airborne surveys to satellite missions—and across the full range of spherical harmonic degrees.},

Guided by the Job Demands-Resources model, the present study pioneered the investigation of the predictive power of academics’ research agendas for their emotions in teaching, considering the mediating role of academic self-efficacy (i.e., teaching efficacy and research efficacy). Participants were 332 academics from nine research-oriented comprehensive universities in mainland China. The participants responded to the Multi-Dimensional Research Agendas Inventory-12, the Research-Teaching Efficacy Inventory-6, and the Emotions in Teaching Inventory-Revised-6. Academics who were more deeply engaged in creative research agendas tended to report more positive emotions in teaching, whereas those more engaged in conventional research agendas tended to report more negative teaching emotions. These statistical predictive findings were obtained, with academics’ age, academic rank, gender, and academic discipline controlled for. Moreover, teaching efficacy provided a pathway from creative research agendas to both positive and negative teaching emotions. These findings unveiled intricate interconnections between academics’ research and teaching. The study has made theoretical contributions and it has practical implications for both academics and university senior managers in their respective efforts to promote positive teaching emotions through fostering creativity in research agendas and boosting teaching efficacy. Furthermore, the limitations of the study can provide guidance for future research directions.},

The proposed model is based on the numerical solution of a system of Navier-Stokes equations, the discretization of which is carried out by the finite volume method on an arbitrary unstructured grid, and the iterative solution is carried by the SIMPLE algorithm. During RANS calculations, an SST turbulence model is used to determine the flow parameters. In addition, developed before by authors an original method is applied to connect unmatched-grid fragments. The method accounts for the features of solving the hydrodynamic equations modeling a viscous incompressible fluid flow at the adjacent boundaries of the grid’s unmatched fragments. At the second stage of the calculation, to create artificial turbulence, the method of generating velocity fluctuations at the input boundaries of the LES region is used, adapted to account for the inconsistency of the grids between the RANS and LES regions. The developed hybrid model was applied to simulate the thermally-compressible viscous fluid flow experimentally investigated in a Vattenfall T-junction. The numerical experiments show the effectiveness and sufficient accuracy of predicting the average flow characteristics of the proposed method.},

Numerical experiments are presented to verify the sharpness of our theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the UWLDG schemes in solving EFK problems with small parameters.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to developing hybrid flux reconstruction (HFR) schemes through weighted correction functions. The methodology synthesizes correction functions via linear combinations of existing formulations, leading to enhanced numerical properties. The proposed framework is demonstrated by constructing hybrid schemes based on correction functions from the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), spectral difference (SD), and staggered-grid (SG) schemes, representing three well-established classes of FR schemes. Theoretical investigation through von Neumann analysis reveals the influence of weighting parameters on the dissipation and dispersion characteristics. Numerical experiments with the linear advection equation, linearized Euler equations and nonlinear Euler equations demonstrate that optimally weighted correction functions can achieve superior accuracy and stability compared to their constituent base schemes. Specifically, the optimal weighting coefficient in the HFR1 scheme enables it to achieve even higher accuracy than the DG scheme, whereas the optimal weighting coefficient in the HFR2 scheme yields a CFL limit exceeding that of the SG scheme. From a practical perspective, this work provides a straightforward approach for generating a wide range of FR schemes with predictable numerical characteristics.},

  abstract = {Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy enhances dose delivery by dynamically adjusting beam intensities to target tumorous tissues while preserving healthy organs. One of the most effective planning approaches uses the Generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose metric, which ensures high-quality treatment plans but requires tuning several hyperparameters for each anatomical structure. Traditionally, this process is performed manually by clinical experts, making it time-consuming and dependent on human expertise. To address these challenges, a previous method combined multi-objective evolutionary search with gradient-based optimization to automate the tuning process. However, this hybrid strategy incurs high computational cost, as each candidate solution must undergo a complete gradient-based optimization step, repeated thousands of times throughout the process. This study introduces two complementary strategies to improve the efficiency of this framework. First, we analyze alternative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms that converge more rapidly, thereby reducing the number of required function evaluations, and we compare three gradient-based optimization methods to identify the one that accelerates convergence without compromising plan quality. Second, we implement a parallel computing framework that distributes the function evaluations across heterogeneous multicore computing clusters using a static batch scheduling strategy adapted to each node’s computational capacity. Combined, these algorithmic and computational enhancements yield an acceleration factor of 4049 compared to the original implementation. As a result, high-quality radiotherapy treatment plans can be automatically generated in approximately one hour, making this approach viable for integration into time-constrained clinical workflows.},

These open-ended projects fostered an environment where the pre-service teachers could take risks, embrace failure, and reflect on their development, building essential skills such as problem-solving, creative confidence, and resilience.

Furthermore, the study examines how three distinct forms of imagination (initiating, conceiving, and transforming) moderate these relationships. Using a two-wave, time-lagged design, data were collected from 519 trained volunteers participating in science education programs. Results indicate that both stretching and embracing curiosity significantly predict subsequent PsyCap, but these effects are uniquely moderated by different facets of imagination. More importantly, imagination exhibits a dual influence: depending on its type, it can either amplify or constrain the positive impact of curiosity on PsyCap development. These findings advance our understanding of the cognitive pathways underpinning PsyCap and highlight practical implications for designing interventions in educational and professional learning environments.},

The developed DT test was initially evaluated with participants from an enrichment program during the first study. For validation, intelligence was measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices 2, as well as scientific inquiry skills in biology, inductive thinking skills in biology, situational interest, and subjective task values across different subjects. In the second study, the developed DT test was applied to a randomized sample from different schools. In both studies, the DT test demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability. The investigation into the factor structure showed that each task represented a different factor, and the test has limited ability to measure individual DT constructs. Positive correlations were identified between fluency and scientific inquiry skills, as well as between fluency and scientific inductive thinking. The results indicate that the developed test is capable of measuring facets of subject-specific DT and provides an initial option for researchers and educators to assess DT in biology. Future research should explore the effects of different task types, instructions, and time limits. Replications for other STEM subjects, age groups, and comparisons to classic DT tests should be conducted.},

These factors influence the viability and survival of juvenile predators, leading to potential deviations in population predictions. To account for the inherent memory and hereditary properties in ecological interactions, we employ fractional-order derivatives, thereby extending the classical prey–predator framework. The proposed model accounts for maturation delays, stage-specific interactions, and differential survival rates, offering a more comprehensive understanding of population stabilization across multiple life stages. Our analysis highlights how structural complexity in the habitat critically affects juvenile hunting efficiency and the associated maladroit costs, such as increased mortality due to unsuccessful hunting attempts during key developmental periods. Both analytical and numerical techniques are employed to investigate the stability and bifurcation behavior of the system under varying ecological parameters. The results underscore the importance of habitat features and predator limitations in shaping population dynamics and ecological resilience. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of biodiversity conservation and the strategic management of ecosystems under natural and anthropogenic pressures.},

This approach captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, leading to more accurate descriptors and more efficient computational processes. However, even fundamental tasks like compression and data enhancement present meaningful challenges in the manifold setting. This paper introduces a multiscale transform that aims to represent manifold-valued sequences at different scales, enabling novel data processing tools for various applications. Similar to traditional methods, our construction is based on a refinement operator that acts as an upsampling operator and a corresponding downsampling operator. Inspired by Wiener’s lemma, we term the latter as the reverse of the former. It turns out that some upsampling operators, for example, least-squares-based refinement, do not have a practical reverse. Therefore, we introduce the notion of pseudo-reversing and explore its analytical properties and asymptotic behavior. We derive analytical properties of the induced multiscale transform and conclude the paper with numerical illustrations showcasing different aspects of the pseudo-reversing and two data processing applications involving manifolds.},

Two equilibrium states are identified: a boundary equilibrium and a positive (interior) equilibrium, whose existence depends on the relative cost structures of the firms. For the non-delayed case, we derive conditions for the local stability of both equilibria and demonstrate that a flip (period-doubling) bifurcation occurs as the adjustment speed increases. When time delays are introduced, the stability properties of the boundary equilibrium remain unaffected, while the dynamics of the interior equilibrium become sensitive to the overall delay. In particular, when the leader and follower updates are effectively synchronized, reflecting a collective timing of reactions, the stability region of the positive equilibrium expands, and a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation is observed; in contrast, asynchronous updates yield dynamics similar to those of the non-delayed model. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the various routes to chaotic behavior. These results emphasize the role of reaction timing and delay interactions in shaping market dynamics in oligopolistic settings.},

  abstract = {The dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys is closely related to both the internal strengthening phases and external impact loads. However, the prediction of fracture toughness is challenging due to complex factors such as multi-scale effects, non-linearity, and strong correlations. To address these challenges, a novel prediction method for the dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys has been proposed, which integrates multi-scale numerical simulations (physical models) with machine learning techniques. This method considers both external factors (impact velocity) and internal factors (the size and distribution of strengthening phases).The study analyzes the correlation between impact velocity, the size and distribution of strengthening phases, and dynamic fracture toughness. It also proposes an optimization strategy for the hidden layer depth and the number of neurons in the neural network, resulting in an optimal network structure (8 layers with 25 neurons per layer) for predicting dynamic fracture toughness. Based on this optimized network structure, the study identifies the optimal sample size (N = 90) for ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy in the fracture toughness model. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted on the fitting and prediction performance of various machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees (DT). Among these, the ANN model demonstrates the best performance, with an average absolute error of 6.73 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.98. Additional validation confirms the model's excellent capability for both interpolation and extrapolation.This research successfully achieves accurate predictions of the dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys, incorporating physical information transfer.

Results show that both learners and mentors were satisfied with the topics and course materials and found the course to be useful, interesting, and feasible. Human support from mentors and organizers is more valuable to adolescents than machine support, such as automated feedback. Overall, the TCC course is a good example of an introductory programming MOOC for adolescents, where successful students can continue their studies at the university. The results of our study provide valuable insights for developing programming MOOCs with various engagement strategies for increasing course completion rates for young people, which can benefit other MOOC developers and instructors planning computer science courses for youths.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the construction of rational motions of a minimal quaternionic degree that generate a prescribed plane trajectory (a “rational torse”). Using the algebraic framework of dual quaternions, we formulate the problem as a system of polynomial equations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such motions, establish a method to compute solutions and characterize solutions of minimal degree. Our findings reveal that a rational torse is realizable as a trajectory of a rational motion if and only if its Gauss map is rational. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the minimal degree of a motion polynomial is geometrically related to a drop of degree of the Gauss and algebraically determined by the structure of the torse’s associated plane polynomial and the real greatest common divisor of its vector part. The developed theoretical framework has potential applications in robotics, computer-aided design, and computational kinematic, offering a systematic approach to constructing rational motions of small algebraic complexity.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new splitting approach for the numerical solution of a nonlinear Kawarada equation with mixed derivative terms. Such equations model physical phenomena where the solution remains bounded while its time derivative may become unbounded, reflecting strong quenching behavior. The proposed method decomposes the Kawarada equation into interconnected components, which are then approximated using diagonally stretched finite difference formulas. To effectively handle the quenching singularity and dynamics, a semi-adaptive procedure is incorporated. The resulting implicit splitting strategy is shown to be numerically stable and convergent without requiring the freezing or linearization of the nonlinear source term, as is common in conventional analysis. The new method enables accurate computation of key quenching characteristics, such as quenching time, location, and critical values, which are validated against known solutions.
                  Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and to assess the convergence order of the implemented diagonally stretched splitting scheme.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for reasoning problems. They are among the leading techniques for context inference, particularly in scenarios with strong sequential dependencies, where earlier inputs dynamically influence subsequent responses. However, existing reasoning paradigms such as X-of-thoughts (XoT) typically rely on unidirectional, left-to-right inference with limited inference paths. This renders them ineffective in handling inherent skip logic and multi-path reasoning, especially for contexts such as a multi-turn social survey. To address this, we propose Random Forest of Thoughts (RFoT), a novel prompting framework grounded in the principles of reasoning path fusion for skip logic. It uses Iterative Chain-of-Thought (ICoT) prompting to generate a diverse set of reasoning thoughts. These thoughts are then assessed using a cooperative contribution evaluator to estimate their contribution. By randomly sampling and fusing the top-
                        k
                      reasoning thoughts, RFoT simulates uncertain skip logic and constructs a rich forest of plausible thoughts. This enables it to achieve robust multi-path reasoning, where each question sequence formed by the skip logic is treated as an independent reasoning path. RFoT is validated on two classic social problems featuring strong skip logic, using three open-source LLMs and five datasets that have been categorized as structured social surveys and public social media data. Experimental results demonstrate that RFoT significantly enhances inference performance on problems that require complex, non-linear reasoning across both survey and social media data. The transparency and trustworthiness of the results stem from the interpretable fusion of diverse reasoning paths and the principled integration of cooperative evaluation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Determining multiscale properties of the media is a challenging task because the observables often are of a macroscopic nature, e.g., production data in porous heterogeneous flows. This paper proposes a new approach for determining effective properties for multicontinuum models that arise in multiscale problems. Multicontinuum models use multiple macroscopic parameters in each coarse grid block for accurate prediction. Each macroscopic variable is associated with a local constraint problem for the averages. By changing the number of continua, one can achieve better accuracy while having continuous coarse-scale quantities (with physical meaning), such as solutions and effective properties. As a result, the inversion is performed on a coarse grid using smoothing constraints. In the proposed approach, the problem of computing is transformed into a problem of parameter identification and determining the macroscopic model representing the underlying multiscale problem. An optimization approach called an artificial bee colony algorithm is used for parameter identification. As an example, a dual continuum model is considered. A regular algorithm with fixed weight coefficients of smoothing constraints and a balanced algorithm in which the weight coefficients are updated to keep the objective function members balanced are proposed. To verify the proposed multicontinuum inversion approach, model problems with different heterogeneous properties and source terms are considered. Both optimization algorithms can efficiently identify the effective properties of the multicontinuum model. The balanced algorithm achieves faster convergence, while the regular algorithm provides smoother effective properties.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent probes are widely employed in metal ion detection because of their high responsiveness and ability to distinguish between different ions. These probes provide continuous, non-invasive monitoring of ions, making them valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Herein, we synthesized a fluorescent probe 1 having a naphthalimide-benzothiazole skeleton for the selective detection of Fe3+ ions. The optical characteristics of the probe exhibit ratiometric behavior in absorption spectroscopy, whereas a “turn-off” fluorescence response is observed upon interaction with Fe3+ ions. These perturbations could be attributed to the formation of a metal-probe complex, thereby altering the electronic configuration. Further, the LOD for Fe3+ was determined to be 1.05 μM. The probe was found to exhibit reversibility and recyclability in the presence of a chelating agent, EDTA. The electronic structure analysis of the probe and its Fe3+ complex was conducted using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. It exhibits a decrease in HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon metal coordination, suggesting enhanced stability and reactivity. The probe also exhibits favorable nonlinear optical properties, with a significant hyperpolarizability value, highlighting its potential for optical applications. Additionally, the topological analysis revealed the spatial localization of the electrons in the probe and its complex. To gain biological insights, in silico studies of probe 1 were carried out with DNA and serum proteins such as HSA and BSA, underscoring its dual functionality as both a probe and a potential therapeutic agent. Molecular docking studies further substantiated the favorable interactions between probe 1 and its biological targets (HSA and BSA), thereby confirming its biological relevance and supporting its potential for efficient target-specific delivery in the human body when used as a therapeutic agent.},

The participants (N = 85) completed cognitive ability tasks (Japanese version of the Semantic Similarities Test, Raven Progressive Matrices Short, and Ideation fluency task) and a metaphorical interpretation task, in which they listed multiple features of the presented metaphors. Each participant’s interpretation of the metaphors was modeled using the predication model, and the parameters (k and m) were determined to maximize the evaluation metrics (Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank). We found that the similarity reasoning ability affected the spreading activation of the vehicle concept and the degree of constraints on the topic. Compared to previous studies that found that the outcome of metaphor comprehension relates to similarity reasoning ability, our results showed that similarity reasoning ability is also related to the processes of metaphor comprehension.},

Given the growing complexity of today’s societal challenges, tackling them both requires inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to research and teaching. This study shows how an innovative teaching approach, which integrated street-art into an inter- and transdisciplinary course, facilitated new opportunities for learning to address complex societal issues in a higher education setting. The application of street-art as a ‘boundary object’ catalysed knowledge integration and interdisciplinary collaboration by facilitating communication, bridging disciplinary and cultural divides, and forging a shared language among students. We found that engagement with, and the production of, street-art fostered inter- and transdisciplinary learning in the following ways: 1) street-art supported the development of new competencies for students, such as humility and a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives, 2) street-art served as a means for learning to collaborate effectively in a team, and 3) street-art enabled the bridging of cultural differences, challenging students’ prior views on art and its purposes. Additionally, we found that the use of a non-traditional medium, the course design, and the collaboration with an art-based community partner were crucial in facilitating these learning processes. We conclude that street-art is a valuable tool for promoting inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to teaching, in which diverse perspectives can come together, and independent, critical, and creative thinking are fostered.},

At the heart of shrinkage estimators lies the concept of the bias-variance trade-off. Shrinkage estimators intentionally introduce a small bias by pulling estimates towards a central value, significantly reducing variance and thereby lowering the mean squared error. Many industries, such as banking, healthcare, and environmental research, where precise parameter estimation is necessary for modelling and decision-making, benefit from shrinkage estimation in gamma density utilizing prior information. This manuscript presents a class of interval shrinkage estimators to estimate the scale parameter of gamma density when prior information or guessed values about the parameter in the form of lower and upper bounds are available, and studies their properties. In particular, three classes of shrinkage estimators of the scale parameter based on arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean of interval estimators are also derived.Theoretical comparison given to show the performance over unbiased and MMSE estimator. An empirical study is carried out in order to judge the merits of the suggested interval shrinkage estimation over others.},

  abstract = {In the 21st century, the ability to think critically has become an essential skill that can be effectively fostered by dialogic teaching methods. However, teachers frequently struggle to engage students in instructional settings that require interaction and dialogue within classroom discourse. Using a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods research design, this study explored how a planned whole-class teaching discourse strategy affected the critical thinking disposition of 102 eighth-grade students from two Hong Kong schools. A validated critical thinking disposition questionnaire was used for pre- and post-test data collection to assess the effect of the teaching discourse intervention. Paired t-test results revealed significant pre- and post-test differences in the overall score and Truth-seeking, Systematicity, and Maturity of Judgment subset scores in the experimental group. However, no pre- and post-test changes were found in the control group. Further analysis of 32 classroom discourse video recordings conducted using a talk move framework identified three contributing factors that seemed to boost students’ critical thinking disposition in the experimental group: a range of talk moves, the turn-taking pattern between teachers and students, and timely, descriptive, and specific praise from teachers. This study contributes to the existing literature on the effectiveness of deliberately employing classroom talk wherein the talk move strategy encourages both students and teachers to engage in critical thinking, thereby fostering cognitive engagement in a nurturing learning environment.},

Moreover, this investigation explores the potential roles that trait resilience and psychological richness may play in the interplay between trauma and creativity. The data collection process involved administering questionnaires to assess participants’ trauma history, psychological richness, trait resilience, and creative activities and achievements. Additionally, the Alternative Uses Test was utilized to evaluate creative thinking. This study gathered data from a sample of 649 college students (228 males and 421 females). Findings from the path analysis model reveal that: (1) exposure to trauma can positively predict the four facets of creativity — fluency (β = 0.146), originality (β = 0.193), engagement in creative activities (β = 0.170), and creative accomplishments (β = 0.200); (2) trait resilience is positively related to both fluency (β = 0.198) and originality (β = 0.185), and it serves as a moderator in the relationship between trauma exposure and creative accomplishments and activities; and (3) psychological richness acts as a mediator in the effects of trauma exposure on originality (β = 0.012), creative accomplishments (β = 0.014), and the frequency of creative activities (β = 0.025). By extending the scope of existing research on trauma and creativity, this study offers valuable insights into the development of effective psychological interventions for individuals coping with trauma's aftermath.},

  abstract = {Background:
                  Despite extensive research on creative thinking, the role of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in enhancing this skill, particularly among students with varying knowledge levels, has been understudied, particularly in terms of causal relationships.
               
                  Objective:
                  The study aims to explore the causal effects of academic achievement and ICT use on the development of creative thinking, focusing on how ICT impacts students with different academic performances.
               
                  Methods:
                  Employing causal inference, the study analyzes the impact of ICT on creativity across various academic levels to identify differences in creative thinking trajectories among student groups.
               
                  Results:
                  A positive link was found between academic achievement and creative thinking. The effects of ICT on creativity differ by student group: School ICT use (USESCH) may hinder creativity in top students but boost it in lower-performing ones.Homework-related ICT (HOMESCH) benefits high achievers but can be detrimental to younger students. Leisure-time ICT use (ENTUSE) negatively affects creativity in both groups. High achievers’ ICT interest (INTICT) stimulates creativity, while younger students may be negatively affected. Students’ perceived ICT application ability (COMPICT) enhances creativity in high achievers, not in younger students. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) tool analysis confirmed these findings.
               
                  Conclusions:
                  Academic performance correlates with creative thinking abilities, and ICT impacts creativity differently across academic levels, highlighting the importance of ICT integration in education for fostering creativity. The findings suggest that educational policies should take into account the varying impacts of ICT on creativity across different student academic levels, thereby underscoring the significance of integrating ICT in a tailored manner within the educational framework.},

Results demonstrated the superiority of multi-CDM over six single CDMs: it achieved a decent model-data fit, the highest test-level classification accuracy (72.1%) and subskill-level reliability (87%-95.8%), showing robust diagnostic performance. Subsequent diagnosis revealed pronounced disparities: high-proficiency learners excelled in literal comprehension and local inferences, yet struggled with temporal inference. Low-proficiency learners exhibited systemic deficiencies, particularly in global inferences and literal comprehension, underscoring cognitive overload challenges. Instructional implications were provided to different groups. Finally, limitations and future directions were discussed.},

  abstract = {While most literature on critical thinking emphasizes its cognitive dimension, this study explores criticality as a metacognitive experience in cultivating critical citizenship. Drawing on Paul Ricœur’s (1965/1970) hermeneutics of suspicion, it examines how criticality influences citizenship by encouraging individuals to evolve their interpretations of official discourses. Using Chinese citizenship education as a case study, narrative interviews with 12 purposively selected graduates from elite Chinese universities investigate changes in their interpretive stances over time. Thematic analysis identifies a four-stage, semi-iterative model of worldview transformation: participants initially accepted curricular content uncritically but subsequently encountered moments of suspicion that triggered metacognitive reflection and prompted reconstruction of their worldviews. Academic training contributed variably to this process. Confronted with everyday suspicions in social interactions and tensions between state narratives and personal interpretations, participants transformed themselves into critical beings through hermeneutic circle to reconcile these discourse gaps. Thus, the study advances understanding of how criticality can be unexpectedly activated, reflexively exercised, and intellectually directed to foster critical, reflexive, and deliberative citizenship. It also highlights the need for further research on the unintended civic effects of cultivating critical thinking, particularly its role in demystifying ideology, promoting epistemic autonomy, and constructing alternative worldviews.},

Efficiently computing these solutions is crucial for a profound understanding of these problems and enhancing various applications. Therefore, the development of a numerical method capable of finding multiple solutions efficiently is imperative. Additionally, the provision of an efficient iteration process is vital for promptly obtaining multiple solutions. In the current paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for identifying multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic systems, where the trust region Levenberg–Marquardt method, combined with the deflation technique, is designed to compute multiple solutions for the first time. Based on several numerical experiments, our algorithm demonstrates efficacy in efficiently identifying multiple solutions, even when the nonlinear term appearing in these equations involves solely the first derivative. Moreover, we validate the efficiency of our algorithm and unveil previously undiscovered solutions in the existing literature},

Participants addressed three core themes: (a) challenges in competency development, (b) barriers to sustainable growth, and (c) institutional/non-institutional strategies for promoting SCD. Using grounded theory, the analysis reveals that institutional and non-institutional factors collectively constrain students’ SCD, including curricular gaps, pedagogical limitations, and underdeveloped autonomous learning practices. The findings further highlight disparities in faculty expertise, inadequate alignment between coursework and practical teaching demands, and limited support for lifelong learning competencies. To address these issues, this study proposes a series of evidence-based countermeasures: reforming teaching methodologies in accordance with self-determination theory (SDT), enhancing faculty training through the integration of the TPACK framework, redesigning curricula to incorporate sustainable development perspectives, establishing collaborative learning environments to promote resource equity and improve teaching conditions, and cultivating students’ self-directed learning skills grounded in SDT principles. These recommendations are designed to ensure that PEE programs remain aligned with the evolving requirements of primary English education and facilitate the long-term professional development of graduates.},

  abstract = {Creativity is an essential skill in contemporary education systems, particularly in early childhood, where it is stimulated by exploratory activities and the expression of thought through the creation of ideas or the production of new objects. However, its assessment remains a major challenge, particularly for future teachers, who have to reconcile the emergence of creativity with the requirements of training plans. This dual injunction reveals a hesitancy on the part of professionals regarding the definition of creativity and the ways in which its manifestations in students can be assessed. This study explores how future teachers of early childhood integrate evaluation criteria measuring the development of creativity into their evaluation documents. It aims to understand which dimensions of the creative process and theoretical models, such as the 3Ps and the OECD Creative Assessment Grid, are mobilised in an evaluative context. Two hypotheses guided this work: (1) trainee teachers give priority to technical and observable dimensions, often to the detriment of the creative process, and (2) transversal aspects, such as originality and collaboration, are underrepresented. To test these hypotheses, 153 evaluation documents produced by student teachers at the HEP Vaud were analysed using a specific grid. The study combined an analysis of proportions, correlations and a hierarchical classification of evaluation criteria. The results reveal that emphasis is placed on technical and methodological criteria, such as respect for constraints and diversity of materials, while less tangible dimensions, such as originality and collaboration, are marginally taken into account. These trends reflect the systemic challenges involved in assessing creativity that is non-linear and exploratory in nature in early childhood. These initial elements are in line with previous research which emphasises the predominance of observable and measurable aspects of the evaluation of creativity, to the detriment of the creative process, which is more complex to identify. The study also highlights a preference for assessing individual performance to the detriment of more collaborative dynamics. This observation highlights the need to reassess the way in which creativity is understood and taught in teacher training programmes. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of equipping future teachers with tools to assess both tangible outcomes and intangible processes, paving the way for a balanced and effective approach to promoting creativity in young learners in a rapidly changing educational landscape.},

Previous cross-sectional studies yielded mixed findings on the relationship between social media use (SMU) and self-perceived creativity. It remains unclear how multiple aspects of SMU are associated with self-perceived creativity over time. This study aims to investigate the links between self-perceived creativity and various facets of SMU, including duration, form, and purpose. We conducted a 14-day diary study (N = 208) and a six-month interval survey (N = 204). Residual dynamic structural equation modeling results revealed that active SMU, social-oriented, and cognitive-oriented SMU positively predicted self-perceived creativity on the same day. Conversely, the duration of SMU, passive SMU, and hedonic-oriented SMU had no significant effects. Furthermore, longitudinal regression analyses showed that only social-oriented and cognitive-oriented SMU positively predicted self-perceived creativity six months later. Notably, no significant predictive effects were found from self-perceived creativity to SMU. These findings suggest that the impact of SMU on self-perceived creativity depends on the specific ways people engage with social media.},

By exploiting the GSTC-characterized metasurface properties, we develop a residual-type posteriori error estimator, and rigorously prove its boundedness. Using an absorbing metasurface as a benchmark case, we demonstrate the convergence of the AFEM based on this error estimator. Numerical experiments on diverse functional metasurfaces verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves both the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulations, providing a reliable theoretical framework and numerical tools for the design and analysis of functional metasurfaces.},

The differential equation contains a zero order term. Compared to the case of no zero order term, the character of the exponential splines are more complicated and the associated pointwise error analysis relies more on the finite element formulation.

Moreover, we verify the pricing accuracy of the approximated solutions for perpetual American strangle options under SVCEV by comparing our solutions with the prices derived from Monte Carlo simulations.

  abstract = {A fractional partition of unity finite element method is proposed for the solution of the transient anomalous diffusion equation. The Caputo integro-differential operator is employed to represent the fractional time-derivative in these problems. To approximate the Caputo fractional derivative, we propose a new numerical differentiation formula using quadratic splines. For the spatial discretization, we implement an enriched finite element method on unstructured meshes. In the present study, a category of exponential functions incorporating fractional orders is introduced as enrichment functions to refine the finite element approximation. These functions are designed to capture the fractional characteristics of the solution more effectively. By integrating these enrichment functions through the partition of unity framework, the method utilizes prior knowledge of the fractional problem, leading to a substantial enhancement in approximation accuracy while preserving the fundamental advantages of the traditional finite element method. Consequently, the proposed approach delivers precise numerical solutions even with coarse meshes and requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom compared to conventional finite element techniques. Moreover, the mesh resolution remains unaffected by variations in the fractional order, allowing for a consistent mesh structure regardless of changes in fractional parameters. Through extensive numerical simulations, we consistently verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique in achieving high levels of accuracy. This approach not only ensures reliable and precise results but also broadens the applicability of the finite element method, making it more capable of handling time-fractional transient diffusion problems that have traditionally been challenging for standard methods.},

We also propose a method for a special eigenvalue interface problem in engineering, the two-group neutron diffusion problem. We incorporates the idea of decoupling energy loss functions and changes the eigenvalue equations into fixed-source equations. As the neural network is optimized, the fixed-source term evolves with the iterative steps. Finally, ample numerical experiments are presented to validate our methods.},

                  Utilizing a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design, the study examined 156 eighth-grade students from two schools in Hong Kong over an eight-week period. Within each school, a control group was instructed using traditional pedagogical techniques, whereas two distinct experimental groups were exposed to the argumentation model, with one integrating the talk approach to encourage a dialogic classroom environment. Data collection involved validated pre- and post-test results from critical thinking tests, as well as whole-class teaching discourses.
                  The findings revealed a significant difference between the two experimental groups in the paired t-test results of the critical thinking test. Further analysis of the classroom discourses showed the argumentation model with talk approach to be more effective in promoting active learning and the development of metacognitive skills than the argumentation model alone. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the effectiveness of argumentative inquiry and productive classroom talk, particularly that addressing the development of critical thinking skills in secondary school-age students.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational thinking (CT) has gained growing attention in education, especially as societies become more reliant on digital technologies. Despite the growing emphasis on integrating CT into K − 12 curricula, there is still a shortage of validated tools for assessing CT practices among younger students. This study addresses this gap by developing and validating a game-based assessment tool called Critters Puzzle (CP), specifically designed to evaluate abstraction skills, a key dimension of CT practices, in lower primary school students (Grades 1–3). Based on a principled approach known as evidence-centered game design (ECGD), a set of game tasks independent of programming platforms was developed. The tool’s content validity was confirmed through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by field tests. Psychometric analyses were performed with both Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and the results demonstrate adequate reliability and validity indicators. Further analysis of students’ game performance revealed that female students exhibited stronger abstraction skills. Then, the process data was used to identify students’ problem-solving strategies, and the analysis revealed distinct strategies among students, with observable gender disparities. This study introduces a carefully developed and validated assessment tool tailored for early-grade students within the context of Chinese primary school, focusing on the evaluation of abstraction skills in CT practices. The research process has the potential to support future assessment development in CT education and may serve as a reference for similar educational settings. The findings of process data highlight the importance of designing assessment tools that accommodate different problem-solving strategies and provide valuable insights for enhancing lower primary CT education.},

Although reading self-efficacy and creative self-efficacy were not directly associated with problem-solving performance, they showed significant indirect associations: reading self-efficacy was associated with better problem-solving accuracy via enhanced text-based comprehension, and creative self-efficacy with more novel solutions through increased divergent thinking. These findings provide insights into cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational factors that may support the development of problem-solving skills, with implications for educational practices.},

To further investigate this spatial effect and elucidate the underlying mechanism, the current study used a controlled manipulation of space size. We aimed at replicating the influence of space size on divergent and convergent thinking, while also examining defocused attention as a potential underlying mechanism through the Auditory Stroop Task. In Experiment 1, participants performed the Alternate Uses Task, Remote Association Task, and Auditory Stroop Task in both large and small physical spaces. Results indicated no significant differences in task performance across spatial conditions, with Bayesian analyses strongly supporting the null hypothesis. Experiment 2 employed a virtual reality environment, presenting participants with large and small virtual rooms where they completed the same three cognitive tasks using a virtual reality headset. Findings demonstrated higher novelty scores in divergent thinking in the smaller (vs. larger) virtual space, but no significant differences in other tasks. Bayesian analyses again favored the null hypothesis. Overall, the findings of the two experiments suggest that space size, whether manipulated in the physical or virtual environment, does not influence divergent thinking, convergent thinking, or defocused attention. The implications of these findings on embodied metaphor and defocused attention accounts are discussed.},

Using RMSE, MAPE, R², training and prediction durations, and computational variance, three models—Random Forest, SVR, and XGBoost—are examined. Although Random Forest exhibits increased temporal complexity and unpredictability in prediction timeframes, it achieves the highest predictive accuracy with a R² score of 0.999998 in AdDarb and comparable results across other cities. For quick and consistent forecasting, XGBoost is perfect as it provides competitive accuracy, low prediction time variation, and computational economy. Although less accurate, SVR performs best in low training and prediction timeframes, which qualifies it for environments with limited resources. This work offers a complete framework for choosing machine learning models fit to the dynamic and high-stakes criteria of COVID-19 prediction by including temporal variance and computational trends. XGBoost's balanced performance makes it advised to provide top priority for real-time forecasting situations; Random Forest might be saved for tasks stressing great predictive accuracy. SVR may also be effectively used in environments with low processing capacity. The main novelty of this study lies in integrating model scalability, prediction consistency, and time-complexity metrics into a unified framework for real-time public health forecasting in Saudi Arabia.},

  abstract = {A novel method is introduced for denoising partially observed signals over networks using graph total variation (TV) regularization, a technique adapted from signal processing to handle binary data. This approach extends existing results derived for Gaussian data to the discrete, binary case — a method hereafter referred to as “one-bit TV denoising.” The framework considers a network represented as a set of nodes with binary observations, where edges encode pairwise relationships between nodes. A key theoretical contribution is the establishment of consistency guarantees of graph TV denoising for the recovery of underlying node-level probabilities. The method is well suited for settings with missing data, enabling robust inference from incomplete observations. Extensive numerical experiments and real-world applications further highlight its effectiveness, underscoring its potential in various practical scenarios that require denoising and prediction on networks with binary-valued data. Finally, applications to two real-world epidemic scenarios demonstrate that one-bit total variation denoising significantly enhances the accuracy of network-based nowcasting and forecasting.},

We find conditions under which one product persists while the other fades away. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of an associated optimal control problem. We first prove the existence of an optimal control pair and then determine the system conditions necessary for this optimal control pair. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by fitting it to historical data on the daily active users of Facebook and Instagram. By calibrating the model with derived parameter values, we make predictions regarding the future user counts for both platforms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a deteriorating inventory model is developed with price dependent demand and time dependent holding cost in fuzzy environment. It is assumed that, deterioration does not start for a time period which is normal scenario in construction materials like cement. Shortages are allowed to happen and assumed to be partially backlogged. Investment in preservation technology is made to combat the effect of deterioration. Due to limited transportation capacity of the model, a transportation company is hired for delivering the materials. To neutralize the fluctuation in various types of costs in present economic conditions, crisp and fuzzy models are created. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal strategies of the inventory model such as minimizing the total cost and optimal order quantity. The model is validated through numerical experimentation along with the sensitivity analysis. Real life applications in terms of managerial insights are given for the proposed model.},

While previous studies have highlighted its benefits for students, there remains a gap in understanding how teachers can effectively implement it to promote students’ maker mindsets. To address this gap, we collaborated with four elementary STEM teachers engaged in a Lesson Study (LS) cycle. Our aim was to delve deeper into DTMP and analyze teachers' pedagogical practices in utilizing it. We conducted an analysis of a real classroom session, employing a hierarchical and nested coding scheme to assess the teachers' use of artifacts and questioning techniques. Our analysis uncovered three significant ways in which DT contributes to reframing ME provided by teachers engaged in the LS cycle: 1) utilizing DT process models to structure learning activities; 2) using DT toolkits to scaffold, visualize, and assess learning; 3) employing DT strategies to support questioning practices. Building on these findings, we developed practical recommendations to support teachers effectively implementing DTMP to develop students’ maker mindsets, bridging the theory-practice gap and enhancing student learning experiences.},

  abstract = {The analysis of binary outcomes and features, such as the effect of vaccination on health, often rely on 2  ×  2 contingency tables. However, confounding factors such as age or gender call for stratified analysis, by creating sub-tables, which is common in bioscience, epidemiological, and social research, as well as in meta-analyses. Traditional methods for testing associations across strata, such as the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, struggle with small sample sizes and heterogeneity of effects between strata. Exact tests can address these issues, but are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, the Gamma Approximation of Stratified Truncated Exact (GASTE) test is proposed. It approximates the exact statistic of the combination of p-values with discrete support, leveraging the gamma distribution to approximate the distribution of the test statistic under stratification, providing fast and accurate p-value calculations, even when effects vary between strata. The GASTE method maintains high statistical power and low type I error rates, outperforming traditional methods by offering more sensitive and reliable detection. It is computationally efficient and broadens the applicability of exact tests in research fields with stratified binary data. The GASTE method is demonstrated through two applications: an ecological study of Alpine plant associations and a 1973 case study on admissions at the University of California, Berkeley. The GASTE method offers substantial improvements over traditional approaches. The GASTE method is available as an open-source package at https://github.com/AlexandreWen/gaste.

  abstract = {Acid sphingomyelinases (aSMases) are enzymes involved in the repair of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. However, neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases) have also been shown to possess other roles in bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms, especially as virulence factors. These enzymes exhibit structural conservation but are characterized by elusive homology and the lack of sequence signatures or motifs. In a previous study, we reported the structural features of the complete set of sphingomyelinases (SMases) in Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis, showing structural homology and functional differences in two aSMases from E. histolytica (EhSMase). However, the approach was limited due to the AlphaFold3 source code not being publicly available at the time. In this report, the structural transitions in the aSMases from T. vaginalis (TvSMase) were measured using open-source AlphaFold3 and collective motions of proteins via Normal Mode Analysis in internal coordinates. They compared them with the models from aSMase4 (EHI_100080) and aSMase6 (EHI_125660) from E. histolytica, containing different combinations of ligands. Using full-length sphingomyelin and the Mg2+ and Co2+ ions, where Co2+ was shown to inhibit the enzymes of both organisms, we demonstrate that the enzymes exhibit limited flexibility and deformability, except for the T. vaginalis TVAG_271580 enzyme, which displays high structural deformability. This contrasts with the inhibitory mechanism elicited by Co2+ as shown previously. TVSMase3 (TVAG_222460) could not be modelled with the sphingomyelin in the active site pocket, suggesting a regulatory role rather than a functional active enzyme. Additional physicochemical parameters calculated for T. vaginalis enzymes suggest unstable structures and high internal mobility (estimated using the Internal Coordinate method), which may be associated with the functional role of these enzymes. The results presented here open an avenue for searching for novel inhibitors of aSMases that target their physical properties, which could potentially complement treatment to control the parasite burden. These inhibitors could be valuable for further studying the role of these enzymes in parasite pathobiology and, potentially, as therapeutic targets.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, creating substantial challenges for international healthcare. Medicinal and aromatic plants offer diverse pharmaceutical properties owing to their richness in chemical constituents. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of essential oil from Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), which demonstrated inhibitory potential, indicating its possible role in AD management. Preliminary phytochemical screening, followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, led to the identification of seventeen compounds, collectively accounting for 97.70 % of the total area, with patchouli alcohol (26.21 %) emerging as the predominant constituent. In-vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity tests revealed that sesquiterpene-rich patchouli essential oil had a lower (IC50 24.15 µg/mL) than the standard galantamine (IC50 25.66 µg/mL), highlighting the higher inhibition potential of patchouli essential oil on acetylcholinesterase. In-silico studies revealed that patchouli alcohol exhibited the highest binding affinity with a docking score of −8.5 kcal/mol, while 1H-Cycloprop[e]azulene, 1a,2,3,4,6,7,7a,7b-octahydro-1,1,4,7-tetramethyl showed the lowest docking score of −6.8 kcal/mol, highlighting the differential binding interactions of the compounds with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. All key compounds demonstrated acceptable ADME properties, including compliance with Lipinski's rule of five, favorable topological polar surface area (TPSA), high gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and suitable bioavailability scores. Molecular dynamics simulations (600 ns) confirmed stable AChE-ligand interactions (six complexes), with RMSD values of ∼2.5–3.5 Å, SASA around 2050–2200 Å², and Rg between 21.8 and 23.4 Å, indicating compact and stable protein-ligand complexes, indicating its potential as an AD therapeutic agent.},

This study employed bioinformatics approaches to identify crucial targets and immune-infiltrating patterns in RIF. By screening the microarray datasets GSE22459 and GSE76882, we identified 163 and 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, with 80 core genes in common between RIF and healthy specimens. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified five hub genes—G protein-coupled receptor 18 (GPR18), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), and Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9). These were clustered into a functional group related to chemokine signaling, lymphocyte activation modulation, and leukocyte activation modulation. Immune cell infiltration analysis further revealed that the enrichment levels of 13 immune cell subtypes were significantly different in RIF samples, with Th1 cell enrichment being notably downregulated. To validate these computational findings, a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis model was established in mice. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining revealed that in UUO-induced mouse kidneys, the protein levels of GPR18, CCL5, CCR5, CCL19, and CXCL9 were remarkably elevated compared with the normal control. These results confirm the potential of these 5 hub genes as therapeutic targets in RIF. This study helps reveal the underlying mechanisms of RIF.},

In solvent medium, as synthesized TMP molecule preferably oriented in its keto form (ketonic TMP) or in enol form (enolic TMP) such a way that the keto form is predominant in polar medium and enol form in non-polar medium. Irrespective of high polarity, interestingly in aqueous solvent medium the leading single peak ketonic form converted slowly in real time into its enolic form through the water mediated intermolecular proton transfer procedure. In emission, ketonic TMP shows high fluorescence in its existing solvents for extended π conjugations whereas normal enolic TMP is non-fluorescent in protic solvents and very weekly fluorescent in aprotic solvents due to forbidden transitions. In water only, after a certain time of keto to enol conversion i.e. at low ketonic concentration, a bathochromic shift of low intense ketonic emission is identified as enolic emission after excited state proton transfer. As well, in aprotic solvents, weekly fluorescent enolic TMP twisted in such a way that a new fluorescence active twisted structural isomer is developed as the forbidden excited state enolic transition is wiped out in its twisted isomer. In addition to single ketonic emissive state, two different emissive states for enolic TMP in aprotic solvents are also clearly distinguished in lifetime analysis. A detailed density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have clearly demonstrated the energy levels of the tautomers in aqueous medium, and polarity dependent inter-convertible intramolecular proton transfer between keto-enol state in non-aqueous medium through potential energy curves or surfaces. Dihedral angle plot also show the existence of two stable enolic states in S0 and S1 potential curves as normal and twisted enolic TMP in aprotic solvents. Therefore, in this article, the synthesized TMP molecule with widely used fundamental moiety and having potential activity of various applications is exposed from all its fundamental properties and isomeric structures for future references.},

Sunitinib (SNB) is a potent targeted cancer drug that is reported to induce severe organ damage including renal failure. Cirsiliol (CSL) is a natural flavone that exhibits marvelous pharmacological properties. In this investigation, we explored the potential cardioprotective nature of CSL to counter SNB induced cardiac impairments. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 36) were categorized into control, SNB (25 mgkg−1), SNB (25 mgkg−1) + CSL (10 mgkg−1), and CSL (10 mgkg−1) alone experimented group. SNB exposure led to a notable reduction in the expression of Endothelin Receptor Type B (EDNRB), Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) while exacerbating the expression of P21, P53, Endothelin-1 (EDN-1), Endothelin Receptor Type A (EDNRA). The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were promoted while the enzymatic activities of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GSR), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) contents were reduced following the SNB exposure. Moreover, SNB intoxication led to a marked elevation in the concentrations of C-reactive protein, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), Pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide (ProBNP), troponin-T, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), troponin-I and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Cardiac tissues showed sever immune-inflammatory responses after SNB intoxication as confirmed by augmented levels and expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and total fraction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Furthermore, the SNB administration upregulated the concentrations of cysteine-aspartic proteases-9 (Caspase-9), cysteine-aspartic proteases-3 (Capase-3), and Bcl-2–associated X protein (Bax) while declining the concentration of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). SNB intoxication caused histological disarrays including myofibrillar degeneration, capillary dilation, wavy fibers, necrosis of focal regions, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, inflammation and interstitial edema. Nonetheless, CSL therapy notably reversed these pathological changes via upregulating SIRT1/FOXO3a and endothelin pathways while reducing cardiac inflammation, apoptosis and cardiac function markers.

This study adopted the DDIM primarily for its high inference speed and ability to consistently generate high-quality samples in a limited number of steps, making it suitable for tasks that require high-quality medical images. With the increasing prevalence of electronic products, the number of patients with retinopathy or optic neuropathy is increasing annually, and patients are experiencing these diseases at increasingly younger ages. Moreover, eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration are becoming increasingly common in modern society. The developed CNN model exhibited a 3 % higher accuracy when it was trained using the data generated by the DDIM than when it was trained without these data. This CNN model can screen eye disease symptoms early to enable patients to receive timely treatment, thereby mitigating the risk and consequences of eye diseases. The results of this study indicate that the training data generated using the DDIM can enhance the accuracy of early eye disease detection.},

  abstract = {The impact of the steric bulk of the heteroaryl moiety on the hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene (HTIB)-mediated rearrangement of pyrazolyl chalcones under non-nucleophilic conditions is studied herein. The results demonstrate that the pyrazolyl group of chalcones readily undergoes a 1,2-heteroaryl migration upon treatment with HTIB in dichloromethane solvent. The product of the migration leads to the formation of a series of α-heteroaryl-β,β-ditosyloxy ketones. The structure of these ketones is fully characterized by spectral data (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR), single-crystal XRD and HRMS analysis. The molecular structure is further analysed in-depth in terms of the characteristics of frontier molecular orbitals, global descriptive parameters, molecular electrostatic potentials, Mulliken population analysis, Hirshfeld surface analysis and 3D-energy framework studies. Moreover, the synthetic utility of these α-heteroaryl-β,β-ditosyloxy ketones is also explored in the regioselective synthesis of five and six-membered heterocyclic compounds as a specimen reaction.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men worldwide and is driven in large part by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Upon sufficient androgenic concentration, the AR undergoes conformational changes and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of genes essential for tumor growth and progression. In this study, we performed a structure-based virtual screening of 34 phytochemicals from Euphorbia resinifera against the crystal structure of the AR ligand-binding domain (PDB ID: 1E3G). This screening identified two leading compounds, Resiniferatoxin and Euphol, both demonstrated favorable binding poses and docking scores of −10 kcal/mol and −8.6 kcal/mol, respectively, surpassing Flutamide, the standard antiandrogen (−7.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation showed that these two molecules formed stable complexes with AR, suggesting their potential utility as natural AR inhibitors in prostate cancer therapy. However, additional experimental studies are essential to validate their efficacy, elucidate their mechanisms of action, and assess their safety profiles, potentially paving the way for innovative plant-based treatments targeting AR-driven prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of molecular properties plays a crucial role in drug analysis and discovery. Especially for neurotherapeutic drugs developed for the treatment of neurological disorders, one of today's most critical challenges, this process becomes even more crucial. The prediction of the blood-brain barrier penetration (BBBP) ability of the molecules contained in the development process of a drug is the primary condition for knowing the effect of drugs on the central nervous system. In this study, we developed an innovative deep-learning architecture for predicting BBBP using well-characterised molecular properties. The new method, called XP-GCN (Extreme Parallel Graph Convolutional Network), combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to predict molecular properties. It achieves multidimensional feature fusion for BBBP prediction without relying on back-propagation algorithms. XP-GCN offers a comprehensive approach by combining graphical representations and molecular fingerprints while evaluating molecules through multidimensional analysis of SMILES strings, enhanced with data augmentation techniques. The model analyses various attributes of molecules through parallel GCN layers. Trained on a notably extensive molecular dataset compared to many literature studies, it has achieved high performance and computational efficiency by fusing information obtained from molecular fingerprints. Due to ELM's forward random weight and bias assignment features, the classification task without backpropagation-based training showed a classification performance of over 95 % in less than one millisecond, even in models with a low number of hidden neurons. XP-GCN, which shows a peak ROC-AUC performance of 0.9846 across different hyperparameters, offers a novel approach to molecular feature prediction with its computational efficiency, high accuracy, and classification capability. Furthermore, the robustness of the XP-GCN model has been demonstrated by Friedman and Nemenyi's post-hoc statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a significant public health issue that has a global impact. Significant mortality rates have already been observed due to this disease, and more mortalities are expected in the future. In recent times, there has been a growing interest among otolaryngologists and oncologists in the development of appropriate treatment regimens for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The primary objective of these treatment modalities is to extend the lifespan of patients following recurrence and enhance their overall survival and quality of life. For instance, metaheuristic algorithms (MH), a form of soft computing technology, are commonly utilized in healthcare data due to their effectiveness. Furthermore, metaheuristics rely on the evolutionary search principle. They direct the search process to effectively explore the search space in order to find near-optimal solutions for solving global optimization problems. Tabu search (TS) is a method used in optimization problems and falls under metaheuristic techniques. An essential element of TS is its utilization of adaptive memory, which enhances search efficiency by avoiding local optimality and promoting flexibility. Another example is data mining, which is a subset of artificial intelligence that utilizes data to extract meaningful information from previously unknown patterns. It has been increasingly used in healthcare to aid clinical diagnostics and disease prediction. The proposed technique treated data mining problems as combinatorial optimization problems and used metaheuristics to address data mining challenges, such as classification for unknown data and finding association rules for significant patterns. The Tabu Search Classifier Method (TSCM) outlined in this paper primarily utilizes the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm, enhanced with the incorporation of Dynamic Neighborhood Structure (DNHS), which contributes to better discovery of the search space. The TSCM algorithm identifies three rules based on the patients’ data and generates three precise artificial predictive models to determine and categorize individuals who are at risk of recurrent NPC. With each stage of the treatment, additional features become accessible. The first model relies on a primary data set that includes descriptive data. The second model incorporates more features than the first model but does not include the response feature. The third model utilizes all existing features and includes the response feature, which is observed three months after the treatment phase concludes, the third model is considered a post-treatment monitoring. This paper introduces an Artificial Advisory Healthcare System (AAHS) that utilizes these models to accurately predict the occurrence of recurrence during each stage of treatment and after the treatment as a post-treatment monitoring. This prediction enables the adjustment of the treatment plan and the implementation of additional measures in accordance with the system’s outputs. Given the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence in medical research, the proposed system aims to predict the likelihood of NPC recurrence in certain patients. Therefore, this will enable oncologists to take additional medical precautions to prevent recurrence and enhance their understanding of cancer. The experimental results indicate that the three proposed predictive models outperform the existing prognoses for NPC recurrence.},

The spatial distance between organic solvents and Phenol in the three-dimensional solubility space was calculated, and diethyl ether (DE) was used as a benchmark for preliminary screening. Further multi-dimensional optimization was performed by integrating ecotoxicity, physical properties (boiling point and viscosity), and environmental impacts (mutagenicity and bioaccumulation), ultimately identifying tetrahydrofuran (THF) and several ester solvents (MF, MA, EA) as potential back-extractants. Experimental verification showed that THF exhibited the best back-extraction performance, and the order of extraction efficiency (THF > MF > EA > MA > DE) was highly consistent with the calculation results of spatial distance and interaction energy. Mechanistic studies revealed that back-extraction efficiency mainly depends on hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic effects between the solvent and Phenol. After 3 cycles of experiments, THF still maintained high regeneration rate of DESs and high extraction rate of phenol, confirming the effectiveness and reliability of this screening method.},

All analogues were characterized using multispectroscopic techniques. Most of the newly synthesized derivatives demonstrated excellent to moderate antioxidant activities, especially 4b with IC50 value of 6.51 μM, 2.04 μM and 4.90 μM, followed by 4f displaying IC50 of 8.65 μM, 3.06 μM and 3.74 μM, against DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, respectively. The structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) study pointed out the effectiveness of substituted ring of the indolin-2-one moiety in enhancing the activity. Density functional theory (DFT) at the theoretical level of B3LYP/6–31(G) revealed that 4b was achieved the highest HOMO energy (–0.215 eV) and the lowest IP (0.215 eV), suggesting the strongest electron-donating ability, making it favorable for antioxidant action. In addition, 4f was emerged as a strong antioxidant candidate. Furthermore, molecular docking of the most potent ligand (4b) inside the active pocket of human cytochrome P450 (PDB:1OG5) and human carbonyl reductase-1(PDB:4Z3D) receptor enzymes suggest strong interactions. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation on 4b at 100 ns revealed stronger and more stable binding affinity toward target enzyme. Drug-likeness study suggested that the designed molecules hold suitable pharmacokinetic profiles. These findings envisage that these analogs appear as promising antioxidant drugs.},

Staphyloxanthin (STX), a prominent virulence factor of S. aureus, plays a dual role: it shields the bacterium from oxidative stress generated by the host immune response and preserves the cell membrane integrity. Dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM), a prenyl transferase, is essential for catalyzing the first step of STX biosynthesis. In this study, we evaluated 144,000 compounds, including anticancer agents, inhibitors and approved drugs, and 3D bioactive molecules to inhibit the CrtM using computational approaches. Virtual screening was performed on the prepared compound library, followed by relative binding free energy calculations based on MM/GBSA for hit compounds and 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for top 3 hit candidates. BPH-652, a known CrtM inhibitor, was used as the reference. Our results revealed that Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 exhibit docking scores of −13.113 kcal/mol and −13.015 kcal/mol, respectively compared to BPH-652(-10.74 kcal/mol) against the CrtM. The stability was further confirmed with relative binding free energies of −57.70 kcal/mol for BPH-652, and −104.74 and −113.20 kcal/mol for Cmpd1 and Cmpd2, respectively. MD simulations demonstrated stable behavior of Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 inside active site of CrtM with minimal fluctuations, the binding energy calculated from MD trajectories also support strong affinity of these compounds.

  abstract = {Detecting neurological diseases is an important task in modern medicine, for which it is crucial to accurately model the temporal distributions of disease genesis. In prior methodologies, temporal patterns are used in feature effects and limiting assumptions such as proportionate risks. We introduce a new methodology for neural disease diagnosis, known as LSA-DGNet (Lightweight Self-Attention based on Deep Gated Network). LSA-DGNet utilizes a deep gated neural network module to model nonlinear and time-lagged effects of variables on disease outcomes. We combined multi-scale time-aware self-attention modules with scaled dot-product self-attention modules so that the parallel structures could provide an integrated self-attention mechanism to improve data perception. LSA-DGNet addresses both issues and, hence, sets a new benchmark for real-time, accurate detection of neurological diseases. Unlike existing approaches, LSA-DGNet integrates a lightweight multi-scale time-aware self-attention mechanism with deep gated neural networks, enabling improved modeling of temporal dependencies in noisy EEG data. This design allows for accurate and efficient detection of multiple neurological diseases, validated on five real-world datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. With up to 250 frames a second, it indicant large progress in computational efficiency—game-changer potential—and clinical applications. The entire framework opens up new opportunities for early diagnosis and more tailored treatment strategies and simply revolutionizes how neurological diseases are detected and treated.},

  abstract = {Dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease caused by four distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. The nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) plays a critical role in viral replication and modulation of host immune responses through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptor myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2). Despite its importance, the molecular interactions between NS1 and the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex remain incompletely characterized. In this study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate NS1 interactions from DENV1 and DENV2 with TLR4/MD2. DENV1-NS1 preferentially engages MD2 through extensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, while DENV2-NS1 exhibits stronger interactions with TLR4, forming distinct salt bridges and polar contacts. The wing and β-ladder domains from DENV1-NS1 receptor complex were identified as key interaction hotspots, with the Asn207 glycosylation site positioned at the NS1–MD2 interface, potentially mimicking LPS binding. MM-GBSA binding energy calculations validate these findings, showing MD2 as the main stabilizing partner for DENV1-NS1 and TLR4 for DENV2-NS1. Despite ∼72 % sequence identity, serotype-specific differences in binding geometry and domain engagement were observed, suggesting divergent mechanisms of receptor modulation. These computational results highlight the NS1–TLR4/MD2 interface as a critical site for immune interaction and support the rationale for serotype-specific therapeutic strategies targeting NS1-mediated receptor engagement, while experimental validation is necessary to confirm functional outcomes.},

In particular, the CNFD method is carefully devised on the staggered spatial and temporal grid points to preserve the total charge of the system. We provide several numerical experiments that validate the second-order convergence of the FDTD methods, the conservation of total charge and energy, and the dependencies of the solutions on the model parameters.

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, kernel-based approximation methods had achieved astonishing success in solving different problems in the field of science and engineering. However, when employing the direct or standard method of performing computations using infinitely smooth kernels, a conflict arises between the accuracy that can be theoretically attained and the numerical stability. In other words, when the shape parameter tends to zero, the operational matrix for the standard bases with infinitely smooth kernels become severely ill-conditioned. This conflict can be managed applying hybrid kernels. The hybrid kernels extend the approximation space and provide high flexibility to strike the best possible balance between accuracy and stability. In the current study, an innovative approach using hybrid radial kernels (HRKs) is provided to solve weakly singular Fredholm integral equations (WSFIEs) of the second kind in a meshless scheme. The approach employs hybrid kernels built on dispersed nodes as a basis within the discrete collocation technique. This method transforms the problem being studied into a linear system of algebraic equations. Also, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to calculate the optimal parameters for the hybrid kernels, which is based on minimizing the maximum absolute error (MAE). We also study the error estimate of the suggested scheme. Lastly, we assess the accuracy and validity of the hybrid technique by carrying out various numerical experiments. The numerical findings show that the estimates obtained from hybrid kernels are significantly more accurate in solving WSFIEs compared to pure kernels. Additionally, it was revealed that the hybrid bases remain stable across various values of the shape parameters.},

Our proposed approach relies on the technique Kapl and Vitrih (2021), which requires for the C s -smooth isogeometric spline space a degree at least p = 2 s + 1 on the entire multi-patch domain. Similar to Kapl and Vitrih (2021), the C s -smooth mixed degree and regularity spline space is generated as the span of basis functions that correspond to the individual patches, edges and vertices of the domain. The reduction of degrees of freedom for the functions in the interior of the patches is achieved by introducing an appropriate mixed degree and regularity underlying spline space over [ 0 , 1 ] 2 to define the functions on the single patches. We further extend our construction with a few examples to the class of bilinear-like G s multi-patch parameterizations (Kapl and Vitrih (2018); Kapl and Vitrih (2021)), which enables the design of multi-patch domains having curved boundaries and interfaces. Finally, the great potential of the C s -smooth mixed degree and regularity isogeometric spline space for performing isogeometric analysis is demonstrated by several numerical examples of solving two particular high order partial differential equations, namely the biharmonic and triharmonic equation, via the isogeometric Galerkin method.},

In this context, in silico methodologies facilitate the early-stage prediction of ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) and toxicity (ADME-Tox) parameters, reducing experimental costs and accelerating the screening of viable drug candidates. Computational approaches such as QSAR, SAR, and QSPR enable the assessment of biological activity and pharmacokinetic behavior. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the ADME(T) profiles of 58 organic compounds using computational tools, establish predictive models for toxicity, and assess inhibitory potential against the TLK2 kinase domain (PDB: 5O0Y)—a protein implicated in breast cancer and intellectual disability. Methodology Chemical structures were optimized using the MMFF94 force field. ADME-Tox descriptors—including Log P, Log S, Caco-2 permeability, CYP450 interactions, hERG inhibition, LD50, and DILI—were calculated using SwissADME and PreADMET. Data analysis included Pearson correlation, PCA, hierarchical clustering, and construction of a cosine similarity network. A Random Forest regression model was implemented to predict LD₅₀ values, and molecular docking simulations were conducted using PyRx and Discovery Studio. Results Correlation and PCA analyses revealed key trends, including a strong relationship between Log P and Log D, and groupings based on structural similarity. The Random Forest model demonstrated strong predictive performance for LD50 (r2 = 0.8410; RMSE = 0.1112), with five-fold cross-validation confirming robustness. Molecular docking identified several compounds with favorable binding affinities to TLK2, notably compound CC-43, which showed the strongest interaction (–8.2 kcal/mol) and a moderate theoretical toxicity profile (LD50 = 3.186). Conclusions The integration of ADME(T) profiling, machine learning, and molecular docking provides a comprehensive and reproducible computational strategy for drug discovery. The approach enabled the identification of compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and selective inhibitory potential, supporting compound CC-43 as a promising candidate for further exploration in breast cancer therapeutics.},

The satisfactorily correlations observed between the reaction rates and the oxidation potentials of the anilines provide compelling evidence for a single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. Nucleophilicity parameters (N, sN) were determined in methanol following Mayr's empirical eq. A particularly compelling finding of our study is the good correlation observed between the nucleophilicity parameters (N) of anilines 2a-2e measured in methanol and those reported by Mayr in acetonitrile, demonstrating the role of solvent polarity in nucleophilic reactivity. Utilizing this correlation and the established relationship between N and the Hammett constant (σp), we predicted N values for five additional 4-X-anilines 2f-2j (X = NO₂, CN, CF₃, F, and N(CH₃)₂). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) transition-state (TS) analyses provided activation free energies (ΔG≠) for each para-substituent (X = OH, OCH3, CH3, H, Cl), all confirmed by a single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate. The computed ΔG≠ values inversely correlate with N: electron-donating groups decrease, and electron-withdrawing groups increase the activation barrier. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explore relationships between N and various reactivity descriptors, including the global nucleophilicity index (ω−1), dipole moment (μ), polarizability (α), and hyperpolarizability (β) for the ten para-X-substituted anilines 2a-2j. The data reveal a clear structure–property framework for tuning the NLO response of substituted anilines. Molecules substituted with strong EWGs are superior candidates for NLO applications due to their high dipole moments, elevated polarizabilities, and exceptionally large hyperpolarizabilities.},

  abstract = {The high heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) severely hampers clinical outcomes. Current classifications based on gene expression profiles may not adequately capture patients' overall biological mechanisms and phenotypic changes. Therefore, this study constructed HCC subtypes by integrating multi-omics data based on gene set pathways. We identified transcriptionally dysregulated genes, generated pathway scoring matrices for four gene sets using GSVA, and incorporated mutation data (with network smoothing) to define subtypes. We successfully constructed three subtypes (PS1, PS2, and PS3) that exhibited distinct patterns in immune infiltration, biological pathway characteristics, and genomic instability. Among these, PS3 showed the worst prognosis and was more enriched in pathways related to cell proliferation. The higher silhouette coefficient confirmed the validity of the classification. Moreover, our analysis identified six subtype-specific drugs, such as KU_55933 and Cyclophosphamide, that were more sensitive to PS1. Screening the differential pathways, we identified nine core pathways and performed mutation profiling on the extension of telomeres pathway, successfully identifying three telomere-related biomarkers: POLD1, RFC1, and TERF1. Meanwhile, we constructed a nomogram with important clinical features and validated the subtype of independent prognostic significance. Finally, by integrating 15 machine learning algorithms, we established a reproducible classification model (NN_MLP_10: AUC = 0.930) based on 10 genes. In conclusion, this study successfully constructed and evaluated a pathway-based molecular subtype and classification model for HCC, thoroughly investigated the biological and multi-omics differences between subtypes. Additionally, the identification of three telomere-associated biomarkers offers guidance and a theoretical basis for personalized treatment and clinical use of drugs for HCC patients.},

  abstract = {Robot programming is an age-appropriate means to cultivate children's computational thinking (CT) and executive function (EF). Project-based learning (PBL) is commonly applied to teach robot programming. PBL involves complex, large-scale projects consisting of multiple sub-projects. Each sub-project introduces new knowledge but offers few opportunities to connect it with previously learned knowledge, thus misaligning with children's cognitive development. In comparison, incremental PBL (IPBL) is a tailored design of PBL that begins with basic knowledge, with each new sub-project building on all learned knowledge from previous sub-projects and progressively adding new knowledge to achieve complete project learning. Hence, this research integrated IPBL into robot programming to develop an incremental project-based robot programming (I-PBRP) approach, and evaluated its effect on young children's CT, EF, and learning behavioral patterns. Ninety-five children aged 5–6 engaged in 12-week interventions. They were randomly assigned to the I-PBRP group and the conventional project-based robot programming (C-PBRP) group. Results manifested that the I-PBRP group achieved better performance than the C-PBRP group in CT and in the three components of EF (inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) over time. The progressive behavioral analysis manifested that the I-PBRP approach promoted superior performance in robot programming activities and more positive learning behaviors for children. This research has implications for robot programming teaching approaches for young children's CT and EF development.},

  abstract = {This study introduces a new strategy for pesticide's (dinotefuran) detection by employing amino acid–based eutectic mixtures (EMs) with graphene oxide (GO). Unlike conventional modifiers, the EMs were systematically designed and screened through DFT calculations to get the best EM in a particular ratio (lysine–choline chloride, C12, that is in 2:1 ratio), offering tunable polarity, strong hydrogen bonding, and eco-friendly functionalization. The EMs were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic techniques and thermogravimetric analysis. A high-dipole-moment EM (C12) was selected for non-covalent functionalization of GO. DFT results highlighted significant optimization energy and dipole moment in the GO-EM composite. Electrochemical studies showed the compostie, GO-EM has enhanced sensing ability towards dinotefuran , demonstrating reduced dipole moment and optimization energy. The low LOD (5.6 µM) highlights the high sensitivity of the GO-EM electrode for dinotefuran detection. The results from the tafel plot, and cyclic voltammograms collectively demonstrate that the ability of GO-in the electrochemical sensing of dinotefuran.},

  abstract = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major global health challenge, especially in Asia, due to its high incidence, mortality and poor prognosis. As there are no reliable early - diagnosis biomarkers, ESCC is often detected at an advanced stage, when radiotherapy becomes the main treatment. However, the emergence of radioresistance significantly compromises treatment efficacy, leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Although some research has been done on the mechanisms of ESCC radiation resistance, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap and identify more molecular targets for overcoming radiation resistance, we established a radioresistant ESCC cell model and conducted systematic 4D label-free proteomic profiling. Quantitative analysis revealed 364 differentially expressed proteins, predominantly enriched in nucleotide excision repair, glutathione metabolism, and insulin resistance pathways. Functional validation identified TXNDC12 as a critical regulator of radioresistance, and its overexpression is significantly associated with enhanced glutathione synthesis and intracellular ROS scavenging. This study provides the first proteomic evidence linking redox homeostasis modulation through TXNDC12-GSH axis activation to ESCC radioresistance, offering novel therapeutic targets for overcoming radiation resistance and improving clinical outcomes in advanced ESCC management.},

First, we improved the YOLOv8 model by integrating the Online Convolutional Reparameterization (OREPA) module, achieving a 93.09 % sensitivity for detecting abnormal cells. Second, we employed the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) to classify normal cells (lymphocytes, mesothelial cells, histiocytes, neutrophils) with 98.74 % accuracy. By jointly deploying these models, our approach reduces missed diagnoses and provides granular insights into cell composition, offering a robust tool for rapid and objective cytopathological diagnosis.

Most industrial environments still operate with expensive, rigid and less flexibly monitoring systems. These systems are often difficult to scale and cannot adapt to rapidly changing operational needs. In this work, we propose a new solution that enables real-time data collection and processing using edge computing, reducing latency and guaranteeing quick decisions.

However, many currently available predictive models are often just used as black boxes, lacking meaningful biological interpretations. In this study, we made use of open-source drug response data from cancer cell lines, in conjunction with KEGG pathway information, to develop sparse neural networks, K-net, enabling the prediction of drug response in EGFR signaling pathways and the identification of key biomarkers. To explore the rationality of identified biomarkers, we analyzed distribution patterns between drug-resistant and sensitive cell lines and performed simulated perturbation analysis on drug response. We compared K-net with commonly used interpretable algorithms in biomarker identification, such as lasso logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Our results suggested that K-net outperformed other algorithms in identifying key biomarkers linked to osimertinib response, such as KRAS and TP53 mutations, as well as AKT3 overexpression, accurately revealing their associations with osimertinib resistance. Moreover, K-net revealed subtype-specific top biomarkers for osimertinib resistance, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showing a predisposition to KRAS mutations and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibiting AKT3 overexpression. Our study revealed that K-net was able to precisely identify critical biomarkers linked to drug responses, highlighting the potential to facilitate optimization of cancer treatment strategies.},

Publicly available GEO datasets, viz., GSE226146 (PCOS), GSE18520 (OC), and GSE125664 (MDD), were analyzed, which in total resulted in 21,366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 11,174 upregulated and 10,198 downregulated genes. Common genes PTTG1 and PID1 were identified using Venny 2.0. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING, and 10 hub genes (ANAPC5, ANAPC2, PTTG1, FZR1, ANAPC4, CDC20, CDC27, ANAPC10, UBE2C, and BUB1) were identified using CytoHubba based on MCC scoring. Functional enrichment analysis showed significant involvement of these genes in oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, mitotic regulation, and metaphase-anaphase transition (p < 0.05). PTTG1, identified as both a common and hub gene, was downregulated in PCOS and upregulated in OC and MDD. Drug-gene interaction analysis using DSigDB via Enrichr identified Alvespimycin (for PCOS) and Gefitinib (for OC) as drugs targeting PTTG1. Molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2.6 showed that Alvespimycin and Ephedrone bind PTTG1 with a binding affinity of − 4.59 kcal/mol and − 5.81 kcal/mol, respectively, while Gefitinib showed − 4.92 kcal/mol, slightly less than Troglitazone (-5.3 kcal/mol) for OC. This study highlights PTTG1 as a shared molecular link among PCOS, OC, and MDD, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and providing insights into the genetic and physiological overlap of these conditions.},

                  Material/Methods
                  The research included 663 ANA-positive patients. An automated machine learning approach, specifically Auto-Weka, was used to classify these patients based on 75 features, including age, sex, and various laboratory tests.
               
                  Results
                  The Bayes Network achieved the highest overall performance with 93.1 % accuracy, 77.7 % sensitivity, and 96.0 % specificity in the classification of all patients. The most successful models were Locally Weighted Learning for systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE), with an accuracy of 93.4 %; Logistic Model Trees for primary Sjogren's syndrome(pSS), with an accuracy of 91.4 %; AdaBoostM for rheumatoid arthritis(RA), with an accuracy of 95.2 %; and Sequential Minimal Optimization for systemic sclerosis(SSc), with an accuracy of 92.0 %.

Experimental results demonstrate that SCSAddG achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.868, a precision of 0.710, a recall of 0.606, an F1 score of 0.653, and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.825 in the general dataset S2648. Compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), SCSAddG exhibits slightly higher prediction accuracy and outperforms the Rosetta bioinformatics simulation software 12% in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, in the experimental transglutaminase dataset, SCSAddG exhibits significantly better prediction accuracy compared to CNN (0.744 vs. 0.667), achieving a precision of 1.000. The results of wet laboratory experiments are consistent with the model predictions. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the SCSAddG model outperformed the CNN across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating its superior predictive performance and robust reliability. These results indicate that SCSAddG can effectively evaluate the trends in protein thermostability and serve as a valuable tool to guide protein thermostability engineering.},

  abstract = {The use of emerging micropollutants (EMPs) such as pesticides has raised numerous concerns and problems in the lives of humans and other living organisms. The entry of these pollutants into the environment through agricultural pesticides and subsequent water pollution has prompted mankind to separate these micropollutants from water using extraction methods. For this purpose, the green solvent extraction method is effective in this field. By using green solvents, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), the intermolecular interactions between these solvents and micropollutants can be investigated, and a new green solvent for separation can be proposed. In pursuit of this goal, in this paper, the extraction of 4 newly discovered micropollutants from water such as acetamiprid (Acet), imidacloprid (Imid), nitenpyram (Nite) and thiamethoxam (Thia) using a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (HDES, made of components with low water solubility for easy and good separation of micropollutants) consisting of thymol (Thy) and caprylic acid (Cap; C8) with a molar ratio of 2:3 from the aqueous phase, either as a mixture of micropollutants or individually, was simulated and structural and dynamic analyses including RDF, SDF, CDF, H-bonding, non-bonding energies showed encouraging results. Also, the formation of hydrogen bonds between HBA and HBD was identified and confirmed using 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. To understand the selectivity of adsorption (solubility) and diffusion of pesticides in eutectic mixtures, the effect of intermolecular interactions on dynamic properties at 298 K was investigated. The results revealed strong interactions between pesticides and DES compounds (high extraction efficiency), and two pollutants, Imid and Acet, were separated by green solvent more than Nite and Thia. In this way, the relative stability coefficient was also investigated and confirmed (DES with high stability (S = 3.94) that can be used in the separation of different types of pollutants). Properties such as σ profiles, σ potential, activity coefficient, partition coefficient, and LLE in the COSMO-RS model were calculated. The efficiency of the selected solvent in the micropollutants extraction was confirmed. This work, with a new approach to the extraction of insecticides, firstly introduces a DES that has not been reported for the extraction of such insecticides so far. Secondly, with an integrated computational strategy combining MD and COSMO-RS, elucidating the extraction mechanism at the molecular level, it allows for valuable predictions that significantly reduce the experimental costs.},

Although neutronic calculations of block type HTGRs are quite straight forward, thermal–hydraulic calculations are challenging due to complex heat transfer mechanism in the core. In addition, if high fidelity is applied, the computational power and time requirement is quite high. The high fidelity, loose, and explicit coupling multi-physics approach with Monte Carlo and computational fluid dynamics codes was proposed in this study that minimizes the computational power need without losing accuracy.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are key mediators of angiogenesis, sustaining tumor growth and progression. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising gene-silencing strategy for targeted cancer therapy. In this study, we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against VEGF mRNA using computational approaches. VEGF gene sequences were retrieved from NCBI, and siRNAs were designed using siDirect v2.0 and i-Score Designer. Candidate siRNAs were screened based on GC content (30–52 %), secondary structure, and thermodynamic stability. Hybridization energy analysis revealed favourable binding to VEGF mRNA, ranging from –31.1 to –37.3 kcal/mol. Molecular docking with h-Argonaute-2 (h-Ago2) yielded docking scores between –330 and –351 kcal/mol, indicating efficient RISC loading. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated stable siRNA–Ago2 complexes, with RMSD values stabilizing around 2.1–2.6 Å and RMSF fluctuations primarily localized to the PAZ and MID domains. These findings confirm strong binding affinity, structural stability, and specificity of the designed siRNAs. Overall, our results suggest that RNAi-based silencing of VEGF holds significant potential as a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting angiogenesis in breast cancer.},

In vitro screening, nine candidates (2, 3, 9, 10, 11a, 11d, 11e, 12a, and 12b) assessed their XO inhibitory activity, ability to prevent protein denaturation, and capability to stabilize erythrocyte membranes. Notably, compound 12b emerged as the most promising agent, displaying superior XO inhibition (IC₅₀ = 2.8 μM), effective protein denaturation suppression (89.4% at 100 μg/mL), and significant reduction in hemolysis (92.1% efficacy), surpassing standard drugs like allopurinol and diclofenac. Molecular docking simulations indicated strong binding between the compounds and the XO active site, with 12b showing optimal interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts.

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play key roles in the development of various diseases and drug responses, and mining their potential association with drugs is of great significance in unraveling disease mechanisms and discovering new therapeutic targets. However, traditional hypergraph methods typically rely on a static composition strategy, which makes it challenging to dynamically adjust the structure according to the task, resulting in a limited ability to extract higher-order information. Accordingly, we present a learnable hypergraph reconstruction (LHRCDA) approach for predicting circRNA–drug sensitivity associations. Specifically, the hypergraph representation is initialized based on matrix decomposition, followed by a learnable hypergraph reconstruction mechanism to adaptively capture potential higher-order structural information. After reconstruction, a hierarchical hypergraph mapping approach encodes the hypergraph at multiple levels, thereby further enhancing the ability to model complex nonlinear interactions between hyperedges. To effectively integrate different view representations from heterogeneous graph and hypergraph views, we adopt a hierarchical perceptual fusion strategy that solves the problem of information redundancy or loss that exists in traditional single fusion methods. Ultimately, the fused node representations are nonlinearly mapped using an MLP to output the association probabilities between circRNAs and drugs. Experimental results show that the hypergraph approach based on higher-order structural modeling outperforms multiple existing state-of-the-art models in circRNA–drug sensitivity association prediction. In addition, case studies were conducted on the drugs vorinostat and cetuximab, further demonstrating the potential of our model as an efficient and reliable tool.},

Furthermore, the localization of these 188 proteins was investigated, resulting in their assignment to seven cellular compartments. Screening of the proteomes of other Theileria species, T. annulata, T. orientalis, and T. equi revealed that all 188 proteins were present in both transforming and non-transforming Theileria parasites.

However, existing methods often overlook variations in data quality across omics, leading to unreliable feature representations. To address this issue, we propose scUCAF, an uncertainty-aware network for multi-omics clustering. Specifically, to mitigate the impact of noise on cell feature extraction, we introduce a variational autoencoder with a negative binomial distribution. After extracting each omics feature, we propose a high-confidence cluster-guided contrastive learning method to ensure cross-omics feature consistency. Finally, an uncertainty-aware fusion and gating network dynamically integrates the omics features to mitigate biases from low-quality data and produce reliable cell representations for clustering. Clustering results on eight real single-cell multi-omics datasets demonstrate that scUCAF outperforms existing multi-omics clustering methods.

  abstract = {It is known that Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the highest number of deaths due to primary liver cancer and is one of the leading global oncology cases. Currently, in spite of many other efforts to improve the treatment, the prognosis is rather poor with HCC patients, indicating the necessity of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we undertook a multi-omics approach including exome sequencing, GO analysis, PPI network analysis, bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and Venn and survival analysis to search decisively for drivers of liver cancer. Our investigation focused on revealing particular somatic mutations in genes implicated in various fundamental processes of cellular biology. In view of this barrier, we were then able to single out FN1, JUN, H3C12, HSPA5, and FOS among all components at the molecular landscape of HCC, where the levels of expression in turn related to patient survival. The formal HSPA5 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 5) gene is a molecular chaperone participates in the unfolded protein response and transcriptional endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was highly elevated in HCC tissues. Bulk RNA-seq confirmed the overexpression of HSPA5, while single-cell RNA-seq showed the higher expression of this protein in some populations of tumor cells attesting to its importance during HCC progression at a cellular level. Meanwhile, spatial transcriptomics reinforced these results with more precise data, showing where inside the tumor microenvironment HSPA5 is highlighted. In addition, PPI analysis showed much interaction of the proteins identified, bringing emphasis on their functions in HCC. Increased HSPA5 expression levels are linked with low overall survival rates and so it raised the prospect of being a diagnostic tool. Thus, HSPA5 shows promise as a cancer biomarker as well as a target therapeutic agent for HCC and hence detailed studies on its role in liver cancer and application in precision medicine for better outcome of patients need to be carried out.},

This study introduces an integrated computer-aided drug design (CADD) framework that combines Monte Carlo–optimized QSAR modeling, molecular docking, and in silico pharmacokinetic assessment to identify dual c-Met/β-tubulin inhibitors with potential anti-TNBC activity. Robust conformation-independent QSAR models were developed using SMILES- and graph-based descriptors, achieving high internal consistency (R² > 0.84) and strong external predictivity (Q²ext > 0.77). Statistical validation and the CORAL-based “defect-of-correlation” approach confirmed reliability within the defined applicability domain. Fragment-level interpretation revealed molecular motifs associated with enhanced cytotoxicity, which were subsequently used in the CADD design of new multitarget analogs, enabling rational structure–activity relationship (SAR) refinement. Molecular docking against both c-Met and β-tubulin demonstrated complementary binding orientations and stable non-covalent interactions, supporting the proposed multitarget mechanism. In silico pharmacokinetic analysis indicated favorable drug-likeness, high gastrointestinal absorption, absence of major metabolic liabilities, and low predicted toxicity, suggesting a well-balanced safety–efficacy profile. Collectively, this study establishes a CADD-based multitarget modeling platform that integrates predictive, mechanistic, and pharmacokinetic insights, providing a rational foundation for the development of next-generation personalized therapeutics for TNBC.},

  abstract = {This study proposes an efficient approach for nonlinear optimal control problems governed by variable-order fractional integro-differential equation. The presented approach is based on transformation of the main problem to solving system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The offered computational method is established upon the Dickson polynomials and their properties. Through the way, a new operational matrix of Caputo variable-order fractional derivative is derived for the mentioned polynomials. More precisely, the state and control variables are expanded in components of the Dickson polynomials with undetermined coefficients. Then, these expansions are substituted in the cost functional and the fractional dynamical system. Consequently, the procedure of the constrained extremum problem supported by the collocation method is utilized to extract some nonlinear algebraic equations from the transformation of the desired optimal control problem by a set of unknown Lagrange multipliers. One of the key points of this method is to proving the convergence analysis and error bound of its solution. The precision of the proposed approach is examined through three various types of test examples. The obtained results indicate the superiority of the proposed method and confirm the standard criteria with theoretically accurate results.},

However, its physicochemical behavior is highly dependent on structural state, being a function of amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution, and processing conditions. The formation of polyelectrolyte complexes with polysaccharides, such as carrageenans, can significantly alter gelatin’s conformational stability and functional performance. In this work, we investigated the interactions between fish gelatin and sulfated polysaccharides carrageenans (κ-, ι-, and λ-types) at the molecular level using integrated computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to analyze the effect of carrageenan type, length, and charge on the structure and stability of polysaccharide-gelatin complexes, as well as on the dynamics and stability of gelatin molecule at acidic and neutral pH. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of the interaction of fish gelatin with all three types of carrageenans (k-, k- and λ-) at the molecular level and shows for the first time that carrageenans can form complexes with gelatin molecules of different stoichiometry (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 carrageenan: gelatin). The complementary zeta potential analysis confirmed the pH-dependent charge neutralization upon complexation, supporting the MD-predicted electrostatic-driven association. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated microstructural reorganization in composite gels as a result of strong carrageenan-gelatin interaction. These findings have highlighted the critical role of molecular structure and electrostatic complementarity in gelatin-carrageenan hydrogels and contribute to the rational design of gelatin-based gel systems with desired properties.},

This study investigated how adaptive metacognitive scaffolding (AMS) and planned metacognitive scaffolding (PMS) influenced elementary students’ CT in a GAI–supported programming environment. 74 students were assigned to AMS, PMS, or control conditions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined CT task performance, CT skill use, metacognitive regulation, and cognitive load through standardized assessments, programming artifacts, discourse logs, video-coded behaviors, classroom observation records, cognitive load ratings. Results showed that AMS significantly enhanced contextualized CT performance and promoted more complex, diverse skill use compared to PMS and control groups. AMS also fostered more recursive metacognitive behaviors and reduced mental efforts, while PMS supported higher meaningful engagement. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive scaffolding powered by GAI to support CT development in elementary programming education.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference relies on the posterior distribution, which is often estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. The sampler produces a dependent stream of variates from the limiting distribution of the Markov chain, the posterior distribution. When one wishes to display the estimated posterior density, a natural choice is the histogram. However, abundant literature has shown that the kernel density estimator is more accurate than the histogram in terms of mean integrated squared error for an i.i.d. sample. With this as motivation, a kernel density estimation method is proposed that is appropriate for the dependence in the Markov chain Monte Carlo output. To account for the dependence, the cross-validation criterion is modified to select the bandwidth in standard kernel density estimation approaches. A data-driven adjustment to the biased cross-validation method is suggested with introducing the integrated autocorrelation time of the kernel. The convergence of the modified bandwidth to the optimal bandwidth is shown by adapting theorems from the time series literature. Simulation studies show that the proposed method finds the bandwidth close to the optimal value, while standard methods lead to smaller bandwidths under Markov chain samples and hence to undersmoothed density estimates. A study with real data shows that the proposed method has a considerably smaller integrated mean squared error than standard methods. The R package KDEmcmc to implement the suggested algorithm is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

Simulations were validated against experimental reflectance data. They revealed that small-pore IOs strongly absorb in the UV-C and UV-B regions due to the slow photon effect, making them ideal for sterilization and water disinfection. Medium- and large-pore IOs benefit from additional slow photon effect at the 2nd order photonic band gap, enhancing absorption across both UV and visible regions. Medium-pore IOs are suited for indoor air treatment and water purification, while large-pore IOs with the highest photon flux enhancement enable solar-driven photocatalysis such as outdoor pollutant removal and hydrogen production. For all tested IO designs, the absorbed photon flux exceeds that of equivalent planar slabs, highlighting the advantage of photonic structuring for sustainable photocatalytic applications.},

Despite their engineering significance, traditional numerical schemes for these systems face strict CFL (≤1.0) constraints, limiting computational efficiency. This study addresses the computational challenges posed by geometric source terms in Euler equations governing compressible nozzle flows. The proposed approach decomposes the governing equations into convective and source components: while convection is resolved via an LTS Godunov scheme, geometric source terms—arising from nozzle area variations (quasi-1D) or cylindrical coordinate transformations (2D axisymmetric)—are discretized using a novel combination of explicit and exact schemes. Numerical validations include: (1) quasi-1D cases under supersonic start/non-start conditions (internal shocks near outlets) at CFL ≤8.0, demonstrating shock-capturing accuracy with 55 % RMS error reduction at CFL = 8.0; (2) 2D hypersonic nozzle flows (Mach 4.0 design), achieving stable simulations at CFL = 5.0 with <1 % exit Mach deviation and 66 % runtime reduction. Results confirm that the proposed LTS framework overcomes CFL ≤1.0 limitations while enhancing efficiency—computational costs and errors decrease monotonically with increasing CFL numbers. This method establishes a generalizable paradigm for stiff, multidimensional Euler systems, balancing robustness and accuracy without sacrificing explicit computation advantages.},

Next, we apply financial market concepts such as the self-financing portfolio and the no-arbitrage theorem to derive a partial differential equation (PDE) for evaluating the option price. The structure of the PDE is complex, so to solve it, we employ a spectral collocation method based on Pell-Lucas polynomials as basis functions. Since the coefficients of the governing PDE are variable, the collocation method offers several advantages over the Galerkin and Tau methods. To implement this approach, we compute the operational matrix of Pell-Lucas polynomials and approximate the first, second, and mixed partial derivatives of the model. By collocating the equation, we obtain a system of algebraic equations that can be solved using traditional numerical methods.},

The rise of drug-resistant TB has complicated treatment, while traditional diagnostic methods face limitations in speed, cost, and accuracy. This study explores machine learning (ML) models to predict drug resistance from genomic variants, offering a faster and more comprehensive solution.
                  We compiled a comprehensive dataset of variations and mutations associated with resistance phenotypes from databases such as TBDReaMDB, GMTV, WHO, and CARD. For each mutation, both sequence-based features (e.g., physicochemical property changes, Provean scores) and structure-based features (e.g., hydrophobicity, flexibility, accessible surface area) were derived. Ensemble ML models (Stacking, Bagging and Voting Classifiers) were evaluated for their ability to predict resistance to key anti-TB drugs: Fluoroquinolones, Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Pyrazinamide.
                  Results achieved indicated that the model behaved differently on six TB resistance genes (gyrA, gyrB, inhA, katG, rpoB, pncA), with accuracy varying from 66 % (gyrA Stacking) to 91.37% (pncA Voting) and ROC scores varying from 0.69 (gyrA Bagging) to 0.92 (pncA Stacking). The Bagging model performed best for gyrA, gyrB and rpoB with strong classification, while the Stacking classifier performed well for inhA.

  abstract = {Time-dependent partial differential equations are a significant class of equations that describe the evolution of various physical phenomena over time. One of the open problems in scientific computing is predicting the behavior of the solution outside the given temporal region. Most traditional numerical methods are applied to a given time–space region and can only accurately approximate the solution of the given region. To address this problem, many deep learning-based methods, basically data-driven and data-free approaches, have been developed to solve these problems. However, most data-driven methods require a large amount of data, which consumes significant computational resources and fails to utilize all the necessary information embedded underlying the partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, data-free approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) may not be that ideal in practice, as traditional PINNs, which primarily rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tend to overlook the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in real-world physical systems. We propose a method denoted by PhysicsSolver that merges the strengths of two approaches: data-free methods that can learn the intrinsic properties of physical systems without using data, and data-driven methods, which are effective at making predictions. Extensive numerical experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method. We provide the code at https://github.com/PhysicsSolver.},

This study aimed to identify druggable allosteric site in E2 and screen approved sulfonamide drugs as potential repurposing candidates. Computational analysis revealed a novel druggable cavity between domains A and B of E2, distinct from previously reported sites. Virtual screening of sulfonamide drug libraries using consensus scoring identified bosentan as the top candidate, demonstrating superior binding affinity, favorable bioavailability, low toxicity and established antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Molecular dynamics simulations validated bosentan's stability within the allosteric site, with real-time hydrogen bond analysis revealing sustained interactions with key residues Phe141, Ile136, Ser143 and Arg104, supported by hydrophobic contacts and sulfur-aromatic interactions. These findings suggest bosentan's potential as a CHIKV inhibitor through allosteric modulation of E2 function.

In this study, we introduce HMTsurv, a multimodal survival prediction framework that integrates digital histopathology, host transcriptomics, and tumor-associated microbiome features. Utilizing multi-omics datasets from four major malignancies—colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular, and breast cancers—our model exhibited superior prognostic accuracy (c-index: 0.68–0.72) when compared to single-modality benchmarks, as validated through rigorous cross-validation methods. Notably, our model achieved robust risk stratification (log-rank p < 0.001 across all cohorts) as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, effectively distinguishing patients into distinct survival trajectories. Systematic examination of multimodal signatures identified 14 pan-cancer survival biomarkers, including MAGE family genes, which were consistently upregulated in high-risk subgroups. Additionally, we elucidated distinct histopathological patterns, dysregulated microbial communities, and altered gene-microbiota co-expression networks that were predictive of adverse outcomes. This study not only establishes a generalizable multimodal architecture for cancer prognosis but also elucidates the intricate interactions among histological, molecular, and ecological determinants of survival, providing a clinically actionable framework for precision oncology.},

  abstract = {Purpose
                  This study investigates the causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) composition and myopia development through genetic instruments, aiming to identify specific microbial taxa with therapeutic potential and elucidate their underlying biological pathways.
               
                  Methods
                  We performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary statistics from GWAS of 473 GM taxa (n = 5959) and myopia (26,184 cases). Inverse variance weighted (IVW) and four complementary methods assessed causality (F-statistics>10), with sensitivity analyses to validate robustness. Biological annotation integrates protein-protein interaction networks and pathway enrichment to decode mechanisms.
               
                  Results
                  Our inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis identified 15 microbial features exhibiting causal associations with myopia (FDR < 0.05). Protective taxa included Family Dysgonomonadaceae (OR = 0.947, 95 % CI: 0.910–0.986) and species Megamonas funiformis (OR = 0.979, 0.964–0.995), while risk-associated taxa comprised Class Omnitrophota (OR = 1.144, 1.022–1.280) and species Bacillus velezensis (OR = 1.072, 1.017–1.129). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness through nonsignificant heterogeneity (Q > 0.05), absence of horizontal pleiotropy (Egger intercept P > 0.1), and no influential outliers (MR-PRESSO P > 0.3). Host genetic variants were significantly enriched in PI3K-Akt (P = 9.4 ×10⁻⁵) and Ras signaling pathways (P = 3.7 ×10⁻³). Three hub genes (PIK3R1, KITLG, and IL2RB) may mediate scleral pathogenesis through TGF-β/Smad-regulated extracellular matrix degradation and dopaminergic deficiency via downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Microbial metabolic interaction analyses revealed that Megamonas-derived short-chain fatty acids suppressed PI3K-Akt/HDAC signaling (β = −0.27 ± 0.08, P = 0.002). In contrast, the risk-associated taxon Prevotella massilia elevated oxidative stress markers via indole-3-acetate/AhR activation (β = 0.34 ± 0.12, P = 0.009).
               
                  Conclusion
                  This first MR-biological annotation study revealed a degree of congruence between microbiota-associated host genes and the PI3K-Akt/Ras-driven scleral-immune dysregulation in ocular signaling pathways. The findings of Megamonas-derived SCFAs as therapeutic targets provide a viable approach for addressing myopia through microbiome intervention.},

The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset was used to train and evaluate three popular machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Feature selection methods were applied to optimize model performance, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Mutual Information. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models. The results showed that the SVM classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 98 %, compared to 95.8 % for RF and 96.2 % for k-NN. The SVM model demonstrated a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.95 for malignant cases. Feature selection revealed that mean radius, texture, and area were the most influential features, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirmed their clinical relevance in breast cancer diagnosis. A tumor-immune dynamic model also indicated that treatment efficacy (γ = 0.0500/day) was a critical parameter for tumor control. Statistical significance tests (p < 0.05) confirmed that the SVM classifier outperformed the other models. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with clinical insights to develop an effective framework for breast cancer prediction, offering high diagnostic accuracy and biological interpretability.},

This decision has a profound effect on overall production efficiency, as it directly influences subsequent balancing and scheduling decisions. The integration of collaborative robots (cobots) into these environments further complicates this task. Despite its significance, the joint consideration of model-line assignment and robotic line balancing has received limited attention in the literature. This study addresses this gap by formulating the robotic mixed-model multiple assembly line balancing problem with simultaneous model-line assignment (MLA-RMMALB) and proposing a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model.

To handle the complexity of the problem, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed as a solution approach. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical example involving 21 tasks and benchmark problems from the literature. Solutions obtained under integrated model-line assignment are compared with random assignment scenarios, revealing significant performance gains in both objectives. NSGA-II proves capable of delivering optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently for small- and medium-sized instances, and high-quality results for larger problems. This study contributes to literature by addressing critical challenges in multi-line mixed-model production by jointly considering model-line assignment, cobot heterogeneity, and the parallel operation of cobots and human workers. It proposes NSGA-II as an effective solution method for this complex problem. Practically, the study provides a decision-support tool for manufacturers aiming to optimize both cost-efficiency and environmental performance in robotic assembly systems. The findings are especially relevant for industries adopting cobots in high-variety production environments where these factors must be simultaneously managed.},

However, the identification of key bioactive metabolites and the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The study aimed to identify the bioactive metabolites profile in vivo and elucidate the mechanisms underlying their anti-CRC effects. Initially, a UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS technique was integrated with a feature-based molecular networking approach to annotate 26 prototype metabolites in rat serum. Subsequently, a preliminary evaluation of the anti-CRC effect of the serum was conducted. Thereafter, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were employed to investigate the potential mechanisms and to screen for bioactive metabolites. Following this, the signal pathways of the primary bioactive metabolites were validated through cell experiments. Our findings suggested that the candidate targets of those prototypes’ metabolites were implicated in the PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, cell experiments demonstrated that LR-containing serum could inhibit the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of HCT-116 cells. Molecular docking and dynamics analyses indicated significant binding affinity and stability between the core targets and bioactive metabolites, such as luteolin and esculin. The bioactive metabolites of LR are potential material bases for anti-CRC via the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, offering new insights for the functional development and utilisation of LR.},

  abstract = {The TAM (Tyro3, AXL, and Mer) receptor tyrosine kinases play vital roles in immunity and various complex diseases, particularly cancer. In this family, AXL has stood out as a promising target for therapeutic development due to its significant role in cancer progression and resistance to therapies. AXL and its ligand GAS6 promote metastasis and therapeutic resistance in several human cancers. Dysregulated AXL signaling is implicated in a spectrum of diseases, notably metastatic cancer. Elevated AXL expression correlates with drug resistance and poor survival in multiple cancers such as lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, colon, and melanoma. In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of phytochemicals sourced from the IMPPAT 2.0 database of Indian medicinal plants to identify potential AXL inhibitors. Preliminary screening was performed based on the physicochemical properties of the phytochemicals, followed by their interaction studies in molecular docking with AXL. Of 17,908 phytochemicals initially screened, 11,676 drug-like compounds complied with Lipinski’s rule-of-five and were subjected to molecular docking and downstream analyses. Subsequent evaluation included ADMET analysis, PAINS examination, and PASS analysis to identify potent hits against AXL. From this screening, Neogitogenin and Solaspigenin emerged as promising candidates demonstrating favorable drug-like properties and significant binding potential with the AXL binding pocket. Neogitogenin and Solaspigenin showed binding affinities of −10.1 to −10.8 kcal/mol, favorable ADMET profiles, and with RMSD values ranging between 0.32 and 0.38 nm, indicating stable binding. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation over 200 ns revealed stable protein-ligand complexes with some minor conformational fluctuations. This study suggests that, after further experimentation, modulating AXL with natural compounds holds promise for combating human malignancies, potentially overcoming limitations of existing synthetic inhibitors such as R428.},

In this study, we employedmachine learning-based virtual screening along with structure-based drug design to identify potential SphK1 inhibitors with diverse chemical scaffolds. A total of 16 machine learning models were generated using molecular fingerprints, and the most effective models were employed to conductvirtual screening of the Maybridge library. The screened compounds were then subjected to molecular docking to determine a suitable docked pose against the SphK1 protein. Upon visualization of the best docked compounds, we found that six compounds exhibited strong interactions with the SphK1 protein compared to the control (SQS). To further support our findings, we conducted 100 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all six compounds to analyzeconformational changes and stability. Two compounds (SCR00139 and SCR00133) demonstratedpromising stability and fit well within the binding pocket of the SphK1 protein. Furthermore, MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA studies were carried out on these two compounds, providing favorable relative binding estimations. This study introduces an integrated pipeline of machine learning-based virtual screening for the identification of new scaffolds targeting cancer progression.

To optimize workflow efficiency and improve diagnosis accuracy, we develop an automated deep learning model, called EA-ResMLP, which integrates a residual multilayer perceptron with squeeze-and-excitation attention block and explainable artificial intelligence. The integration of residual connections and attention mechanisms contributes to improved diagnostic accuracy by enabling deeper feature learning and emphasizing the most informative features through adaptive recalibration. The experimental results demonstrated that proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.05%, indicating a 7.98% improvement over the conventional multilayer perceptron. Furthermore, the predictions of the EA-ResMLP model are analyzed using explainable artificial intelligence techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, which generate feature contribution charts to highlight the impact of each input feature on the prediction. By integrating model predictions with feature contribution charts, the proposed model provides an explainable framework for ovarian cancer detection.},

The model incorporates molecular descriptors and drug induced gene expression signatures to represent drugs, while untreated cancer cell lines are encoded through their gene expression profiles. A hybrid architecture based on bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) layers and attention mechanisms is employed to capture complex interactions between drug features and cell line characteristics. The fused representation is passed through mutual attention layers to model intricate dependencies, and the resulting output is used to jointly predict the synergy score and the individual responses of each drug.

Thus, there is a recognized need for cosmeceuticals that modulate inflammation pathways to prevent and treat aging. In this sense, four bioactive compounds were selected for their documented anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether the bioactive compounds astaxanthin, curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol are effective in treating the effects of skin aging, using in silico analyses. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) related to skin aging and the bioactive compounds astaxanthin, curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol were generated using the Cytoscape plug-in to analyze the functional enrichment of recovered proteins. From these main networks, clusters and bottleneck networks were generated. Initially, 5 main PPINs were generated. From the clusters recovered from the main networks, 3 were selected from the general network and 11 from the specific networks. Through functional enrichment of the clusters, the biological process of response to oxidative stress was identified. Blood and blood-forming tissue, vascular, and immune system abnormality phenotypes were also observed, along with an increase in inflammatory response. Additionally, Reactome pathways related to interleukin signaling and detoxification of reactive oxygen species were noted. Finally, the key genes for each network were identified from the bottleneck networks: IL-6 (general and astaxanthin), TAB1 (curcumin), TNF-α (quercetin), and TP53 (resveratrol). Based on this research, the analyzed bioactive compounds suggest potential efficacy to be included in cosmetic products, as they are capable of reducing excessive oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, consequently preventing cellular aging.},

                  Neurodevelopmental anomalies are features of drug-induced ASD and often accompany behavioural challenges. A promising approach to mitigating the side effects of antiepileptic treatments involves nutraceuticals and fortified foods. Experimental investigations are laborious, but molecular modelling, including docking and dynamics simulations, elucidates compatibility between drugs and food phytonutrients at the atomic level.

  abstract = {Modeling cellular perturbation responses is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. However, current computational approaches face significant challenges when learning from sparse, noisy, high-dimensional, and size-limited scRNA-seq data. These limitations hinder their ability to capture complex cellular heterogeneity and perturbation dynamics, leading to poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. Recent advances in single-cell foundation models (scFMs) offer a promising solution by providing biologically meaningful representations. Inspired by the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA) in generative diffusion models, we propose scREPA, a novel framework for single-cell perturbation prediction that aligns the internal representations of a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based model with high-quality external representations from pretrained scFMs. Specifically, scREPA aligns VAE latent embeddings from noisy gene expression profiles with biologically meaningful embeddings from scFMs. We also propose Cycle-Consistent Representation Alignment by aligning the re-encoded embeddings of VAE-generated gene expression profiles with both original scFM representations and initial VAE embeddings, enforcing dual consistency and further improving representation quality. During inference, scREPA applies optimal transport to align the distributions of unpaired control and perturbed data, enabling robust prediction of cellular responses by minimizing mismatch. Experiments on diverse datasets show that scREPA outperforms existing methods in predicting both top differentially expressed genes and whole-transcriptome responses while generalizing well to unseen conditions, cross-study settings, and maintaining strong performance under noisy or limited data.},

The identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic candidates is essential for improving patient outcomes. This study employed an integrative bioinformatics and molecular simulation approach to uncover key gene signatures and explore potential plant-based therapeutics for HCC. Gene expression profiles from the GEO dataset GSE121248 were analyzed using R-based statistical tools to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Key hub genes were selected through protein–protein interaction network analysis and functional enrichment. Three hub genesCOL1A1, NQO1, and FOS—were identified, and their expression was validated using the TCGA, GEPIA, and HPA databases. Notably, COL1A1 and NQO1 were upregulated in tumor tissues and associated with poor survival outcomes, while FOS was downregulated. To identify therapeutic candidates, bioactive compounds from Astragalus membranaceus were screened using ADMET profiling. Selected compounds were docked with the hub proteins, and molecular dynamics simulations, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations, and quantum chemical descriptors were employed to evaluate stability and reactivity. Among the candidates, isorhamnetin demonstrated strong and stable binding to all three hub targets, suggesting its potential as a multi-target inhibitor for HCC therapy. These findings provide new insights into HCC pathogenesis and propose isorhamnetin as a promising natural compound for further experimental validation.},

Among them, the aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) allows for the isolation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of specific structures and other substances. However, this easy-to-use method, in which an analyte is partitioned between two phases, still demands a better understanding of its mechanism to make its application more effective. Herein, we demonstrate how various biphasic systems can be formed according to the nature of the phase-forming components. Moreover, by employing polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPEG), previously unrecognized in this context, we reveal the versatility of nonionic polymers for ATPE, which can successfully act as phase-forming compounds, partitioning modulators, and dispersing agents. Interestingly, as proven by experiments and modelling, PEPEG exhibited chirality-sensitive preference toward SWCNTs, which can significantly facilitate the purification of SWCNTs using various approaches. Capitalizing on this finding, we report how the extraction environment may be tailored to promote the isolation of (8,3) SWCNTs and other chirality-enriched SWCNT fractions. The relationships noted, based on the examination of a model material (SWCNTs), provide substantial insight into the elusive mechanism of the ATPE purification approach, widely employed across a range of analytes, from cell organelles to nanostructures.},

  abstract = {This work considers the numerical computation of ground states of rotating Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) which can exhibit a multiscale lattice of quantized vortices. This problem involves the minimization of an energy functional on a Riemannian manifold. For this we apply the framework of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of Sobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous work that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients methods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy. In this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special attention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search direction and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As known from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum parameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor. Besides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the methods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a standard H 0 1 -metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the numerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed adaptive metric along with a Polak–Ribiére or Hestenes–Stiefel-type momentum parameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the other CG methods that were part of our numerical study.},

Current pharmacological interventions remain limited in efficacy, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Si-Miao-Yong-An Decoction (SMYAD), a classical formula in traditional Chinese medicine, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and vascular-protective effects, yet its underlying mechanisms in AAA treatment remain unclear. This study employed an integrative approach combining network pharmacology, machine learning, and molecular modeling to elucidate the pharmacological basis of SMYAD against AAA. A total of 106 bioactive compounds and 235 putative targets were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database. These were cross-referenced with disease-associated and differentially expressed genes from GEO datasets, identifying 15 targets potentially involved in AAA pathogenesis. Functional enrichment analyses revealed their involvement in the interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways. Integrated PPI network analysis and 3 machine learning algorithms jointly identified 6 hub genes (IL6, PTGS2, IL1B, FOS, MAOA, and COL1A1) as central to AAA pathology. Gene expression profiling and ROC curve analysis further supported the diagnostic relevance of these targets. Five key compounds—quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and stigmasterol—exhibited strong binding affinities with the identified hub targets. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions between the selected compounds and their targets. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the multi-target actions of SMYAD in AAA and offers theoretical support for its potential clinical application.},

By transforming the non-differentiable least-squares (LS) problem inherent in fitting TBR models into an optimization framework, our algorithm combines the optimization of a weighted classification error function for the threshold model with obtaining LS estimators for regression models. To improve the efficiency and flexibility of TBR model estimation, we integrate the weighted support vector machine (WSVM) as a surrogate method for solving the weighted classification problem. The TBR-WSVM algorithm offers several key advantages over recently developed methods: it eliminates pre-specification requirements for threshold parameters, accommodates flexible estimation of nonlinear threshold boundaries, and streamlines the estimation process. We conducted several simulation studies to illustrate the finite-sample performance of TBR-WSVM. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the TBR model through a real data analysis.},

To address these limitations, this article proposes an Adaptive K-Means algorithm (AK-means) that integrates a density-based initialization strategy and an Improved Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (IQIO) method. Specifically, a novel density-aware initialization approach is introduced to generate initial centroids by evaluating data point sparsity and distance distribution, effectively mitigating centroid deviation, and an enhanced IQIO mechanism. In particular, IQIO is improved through two key innovations, including a dynamic neighborhood search mechanism based on the absolute slope of interpolated points and the position of known optima, which significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional methods; and the incorporation of gradient descent to refine local exploitation, accelerating convergence to high-accuracy solutions. To verify the effectiveness of IQIO, experiments on the CEC2017 benchmark suite demonstrate its superiority over 10 state-of-the-art optimizers, with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, confirming statistically significant improvements in 22 out of 29 test functions. Furthermore, evaluations on 18 UCI datasets reveal that AK-means achieves superior clustering performance compared to 4 baseline methods, achieving lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and reduction in Davies-Bouldin Index (DB) compared to traditional k-means, particularly on large-scale data. These results highlight the algorithm's ability to balance cluster compactness and separation while maintaining scalability for high-dimensional data. The proposed hybrid optimization strategy provides a better program for real-world applications requiring efficient and precise clustering of large-scale datasets.},

This study evaluates the cardioprotective potential of esculetin, a natural coumarin derivative, against DOX-induced cardiac injury in rats. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups, including control, DOX, esculetin (50 and 100 mg/kg), and combination treatments. DOX markedly altered the expression of oxidative stress-related genes (Ache, Ar, Sord upregulated; Pon1, Gst downregulated) and impaired enzyme activities, accompanied by increased malondialdehyde and depleted glutathione levels. Esculetin administration, particularly at 100 mg/kg, reversed these molecular and biochemical disturbances, restoring antioxidant defense and normalizing gene expression. Molecular docking revealed strong binding interactions of esculetin with the active sites of key enzymes including AR, SORD, AChE, GST, and PON1, supporting its regulatory role. These findings suggest that esculetin exerts multi-targeted protective effects and may serve as a promising candidate for mitigating chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.

To address this limitation, two novel ester derivatives of IGV, E7 and E14, were synthesized via Steglich esterification and evaluated through an integrated computational framework comprising density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and in silico ADMET predictions. DFT analysis revealed that esterification significantly modified the electronic properties of IGV, with E14 exhibiting the highest polarizability (225.895 Å³) and smallest energy gap (–0.155 eV), indicative of enhanced reactivity. Molecular docking demonstrated that GABA (–8.46 kcal/mol) and IGV (–8.35 kcal/mol) exhibit similar binding affinity and complex stability with GABAAR, supporting the reliability of our computational approach. MD simulations further confirmed the stability of these complexes, where lower RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values indicated that binding of GABA and IGV did not induce significant conformational changes in the overall receptor structure. Moreover, the derivatives were projected to exhibit optimal intestinal absorption (>90%), oral bioavailability, as well as favorable safety profiles with minimal interaction risks and non-carcinogenic properties. Collectively, these in silico findings highlight the potential of ester prodrug design to overcome the central pharmacokinetic limitations of IGV, with E14 emerging as the most promising ASM candidate for further experimental development in epilepsy therapy. Beyond identifying therapeutic advantages of E14, this study also underscores the broader value of integrated computational approaches as powerful and predictive tools in early-stage drug discovery for neurological disorders.},

Existing fluorescent probes are often limited by short emission wavelengths and small Stokes shifts, severely compromising detection accuracy. By integrating a donor-acceptor electronic structure design with computational chemistry-guided molecular optimization, we developed a new fluorescent probe DSMO, which features an impressively large Stokes shift of over 200 nm. The probe DSM-O was found to possess excellent resistance to interference and remarkable viscosity responsiveness. Importantly, it was effectively applied in the bioimaging of acute alcoholic liver injury, indicating its great promise as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for early-stage liver damage.},

Phylogenetic analyses (neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference) revealed three well-supported clusters (bootstrap > 90 %; posterior probability > 0.95). AMOVA (p < 0.01) and diversity indices confirmed significant genetic differentiation. DMRO-356 and DMRO-388s showed close genetic relatedness and phenotypic consistency, while DMRO-623 was genetically distinct. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in genes linked to stress response, metabolism, and β-glucan biosynthesis. Transcriptomic profiling showed higher expression of β-glucan synthesis genes (FKS1, GLS2) in DMRO-356 and DMRO-388s, indicating potential for nutraceutical use. DMRO-623 exhibited upregulation of stress-responsive genes (SOD, HSP70), suggesting adaptation to environmental stress and suitability for resilient cultivation. Compared to traditional markers (RAPD, SSR), the multilocus approach offered improved resolution for distinguishing closely related strains. Strong correlations (r = 0.80–0.88) between genetic variation and key traits (β-glucan content, antioxidant activity, yield) emphasize the functional significance of the observed diversity. This first multilocus-based study of Indian-origin L. edodes strains provides a genomic framework for marker-assisted breeding, trait optimization, and conservation, supporting their commercial and ecological value in diverse environments.},

The MLPT architecture takes the input features from the Adaptive Depthwise Multi-Kernel Atrous Module (ADMAM) as inputs to the Swin Transformer, and the output of Swin block 1 is concatenated with the features extracted from the Kolaskar-Tongaonkar algorithm with the SA-BWK model. This hierarchical integration enhances feature representation and predictive capability.

  abstract = {B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults, progressing rapidly and requiring urgent clinical intervention. Late-stage diagnosis often results in reduced survival rates and typically depends on costly, time-intensive diagnostic procedures. Peripheral blood smear (PBS) imaging plays a central role in the preliminary screening of B-ALL and provides an accessible foundation for computer-assisted diagnosis. To support early and efficient classification, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify B-ALL subtypes directly from PBS images without the need for pre-segmentation. The model is computationally efficient, comprising only 986,126 trainable parameters, and integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules within Inverted Residual Blocks to strengthen feature representation. Experimental results demonstrated excellent classification performance, achieving 100 % accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). To further assess generalizability, cross-dataset validation was performed on the independent Blood Cells Cancer (ALL) dataset without retraining or fine-tuning, yielding a robust accuracy of 99.85 %. Model interpretability was performed using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which provided visual explanations and highlighted key discriminative cellular features, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers a highly accurate, resource-efficient, and interpretable solution for B-ALL classification, underscoring its strong potential for integration into real-world clinical practice.

We propose a novel framework for feature extraction and aggregation optimization (FEAOF), which primarily consists of a feature extraction module and an aggregation optimization module. The model integrates diverse ligand representations, including molecular fingerprints, descriptors, and graphs, as well as ligand–receptor interaction features. Based on this integration, we further optimize the algorithmic framework to achieve precise predictions of compounds cardiac toxicity. Two independent test sets exhibiting pronounced structural dissimilarity from the training data were constructed to rigorously assess the model’s generalization ability. The results demonstrate that the FEAOF model exhibits strong robustness compared to seven baseline models, achieving F1 score of 66.1 % and 68.1 %. Notably, when benchmarked against five existing models on two external test sets, FEAOF also achieved the highest or near-highest scores across all key evaluation metrics.

Due to experimental limitations in capturing spatial thermal distributions within and beneath the pile, as well as the thermal response of individual firebrands within the pile. This study employed a numerical approach to investigate the thermal performance of smouldering firebrand accumulations. The model examined the effects of varying wind speeds (0.9–2.7 m/s) and coverage densities (0.06 and 0.16 g/cm2) on firebrand surface temperature, released heat flux, and heat flux received by the substrate. Model accuracy was verified by comparing its output with the heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) derived from an experimental study, ensuring the reliability of the numerical data. Results showed that increased wind speeds and coverage densities significantly increase both average and localized thermal parameters. For smouldering firebrand accumulations, peak average total heat flux to the substrate ranged from 19 to 52 kW/m2, while localized regions within the pile reached up to 120 kW/m2. These findings demonstrate the importance of spatial thermal analysis in characterizing firebrand pile behaviour.},

  abstract = {There is a significant need for computer experiments to study and model complex physical systems. In both computer and physical experiments, constructing experimental designs with good space-filling and column-orthogonality properties is crucial. While maximin distance designs and uniform designs ensure space-filling in full-dimensional spaces, they lack guarantees for low-dimensional projections. Uniform projection designs address this gap by ensuring space-filling properties in low-dimensional subspaces. Orthogonal designs enable efficient factor screening in Gaussian processes and ensure uncorrelated estimates of main effects in linear models. However, constructing such optimal designs remains challenging. A design that combines these advantages would outperform individual approaches. This paper fills this gap by proposing seven novel theoretical techniques for constructing orthogonal maximin distance uniform projection designs. The proposed designs demonstrate superior performance as the number of factors increases, making them particularly well-suited for surrogate modeling and linear trend estimation in high-dimensional Gaussian processes. Comparative studies show that the proposed techniques outperform existing methods.},

By exploiting problem’s composite structure, we propose an improved version of the proximal alternating linearized minimization method. This algorithm employs a splitting technique, where the nonsmooth subproblem defined in the Euclidean space is solved using a forward–backward operator, and the smooth manifold subproblem is addressed using a Riemannian gradient step. We further extend this algorithm by introducing an inertial Bregman variant, which incorporates inertial step and Bregman regularization to improve both efficiency and robustness.

While previous methods proposed heuristic time-weighting schemes, our approach is grounded in theoretical insights derived from the Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations over time. This principled methodology automatically adjusts weights based on the stability regime of the system — whether chaotic, periodic, or stable. Numerical experiments on challenging benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz system and the Burgers’ equation, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to existing techniques, our approach offers improved convergence and accuracy without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. The findings underline the importance of incorporating causality and dynamical system behavior into PINN training strategies, providing a robust framework for solving time-dependent problems with enhanced reliability.},

The results show distinct differences in the physical interaction profiles of the compounds, with Calicheamicin demonstrating notably higher photon attenuation and energy deposition, likely due to the presence of high-Z elements in its structure.

Moreover, phase stability, microstructure, and mechanical properties were evaluated for all of the ceramics. Compositions containing Cr, V, Nb, or Ta formed dual-phase ceramics containing only one boride and one carbide phase, while compositions containing Mo or W developed an additional third phase. The experimental metal distribution trends generally aligned with thermodynamic predictions, except for compositions containing V, which showed unexpected segregation behavior that was influenced by complex interactions of the coexistence of boride and carbide structures. From the dual-phase ceramics, the composition containing V exhibited the highest hardness (HV1 = 25.5 ± 0.6 GPa) combined with smaller grain sizes (0.99 ± 0.33 μm for the boride and 1.15 ± 0.31 μm for the carbide phases).

Mediation MR assessed SHBG’s role in regulating BAT, and functional enrichment, protein interaction networks, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), and drug prediction were performed to explore therapeutic relevance and safety. We identified 36 proteins that influence BAT via SHBG mediation. Among them, five proteins (MAX, TXNL4B, GLRX2, F13B, SNUPN) showed strong or moderate colocalization with BAT, suggesting shared genetic regulation. MAX and TXNL4B increased BAT by reducing SHBG, while GLRX2, F13B, and SNUPN decreased BAT via elevated SHBG levels. PheWAS suggested potential risks for GLRX2 (depression) and TXNL4B (lipid disorders). Drug and compound prediction highlighted compounds, including cardiac glycosides, antioxidants, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, targeting these proteins. Our findings reveal novel protein regulators of testosterone bioavailability through SHBG and provide a framework for developing targeted therapeutics. This integrative approach may support safer, more precise treatment strategies for testosterone-related metabolic and endocrine disorders.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is paramount for preventing adverse drug events and ensuring patient safety. While existing computational methods show promise, they often struggle to effectively model long-range intramolecular dependencies and identify the most salient substructures for interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce TK-DDI, a novel deep learning framework based on molecular tokenization. TK-DDI first converts drug molecules into sequences of tokens, creating a unified representation that captures both 2D structural and 3D conformational information. A Transformer encoder is then employed to learn the contextual relationships between all token pairs, effectively modeling the influence of distant functional groups. To elucidate the interaction mechanism, TK-DDI incorporates a two-stage attention strategy: an intra-drug attention module to highlight key substructures within each molecule, followed by an inter-drug attention module to fuse the representations of the drug pair. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TK-DDI robustly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new standard for DDI prediction.},

Density functional theory (DFT) was used in this work to explore the therapeutic potential of carbon nanocone oxide (ONC) as a drug carrier for Favipiravir (FPV) against viral infection. The Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMOs) defined the bandgap as a decline from 5.52 to 5.36 eV of Favipiravir when interacting with ONC. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces revealed that in the FPV-ONC complex, the Favipiravir acts as nucleophile and ONC as electrophile. The FMOs also calculated quantum chemical parameters in the gas and solvent phases to confirm the correlation between Favipiravir and ONC stabilization energy in complex formation. The density of state and charge deposition analysis showed the charge transfer phenomenon during complex formation. NBO, ELF, NCI, and iso-surfaces were used to identify the charge transfer between Favipiravir and ONC. The excited states were analyzed by plotting the TDM and spectral investigation (Raman, UV-Vis, IR, and NMR) of FPV, ONC, and FPV-ONC. The drug-carrier interaction generated fluorescence quenching in PET, which also gave a pictorial description of the unique excited states from 1 to 10. The results collectively indicate the therapeutic potential of the ONC carrier as a favipiravir carrier for managing viral disease.},

Methyl 2-(7-hydroxy-3-methyloctyl)-1,3-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohex-2-enecarboxylate (PE14) and (E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-en-1-ol (EA8) are the natural antitubercular lead-like molecules isolated from petroleum ether and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of Ipomea sepiaria, respectively. Extensive research has demonstrated the wide range of health benefits associated with this plant. However, the antitubercular effects of phytocompounds isolated from this species have not been systematically investigated. To evaluate the antitubercular effect of the natural compound, in silico prediction of binding affinity against selected antitubercular target proteins was conducted, and this was compared with co-crystallized ligands as a standard. Additionally, the physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and various toxicity-related parameters were also predicted. Two ligand docking complexes were selected for molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the binding free energy over 250 ns. Moreover, FMO and DFT were also investigated. PE14 complies with RO5 and exhibits suitable ADMET profiles. The molecular docking scores in kcal/mol showed comparatively more potency against antitubercular drug targets compared to the co-crystalized ligand of the target protein as well as EA8. Overall, the strength of interaction between the ligands with their selected target proteins from the molecular docking study, heat change that occurs during the ligand-target interactions from a molecular dynamic simulation study, the electronic reactivity trend was established as STD > PE14 > CIP > EA8 from FMO analysis and other multi-parametric druggability profiles of target proteins suggests that PE14 can be considered as a suitable antitubercular lead-like for the treatment of M. tuberculosis. The results of the current study were closely correlated with those of our previous study on Ipomea sepiaria in the LRP assay. However, necessary in vitro and in vivo studies on the synthesized pure compound must be carried out to participate in a clinical trial, where the in silico results would help expedite the process of drug development.},

  abstract = {Treatment resistance and leukemic stem cell survival are significant challenges in managing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). While Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson (BCR::ABL1) fusion drives disease initiation, emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate critical cellular processes that promote leukemic transformation and treatment failure. We employed a comprehensive in silico approach integrating multiple omics platforms to investigate CML-associated lncRNAs. Candidate lncRNAs were identified by cross-referencing LncRNA Disease and LncTarD repositories, followed by validation expression analysis of data in leukemia transcriptomic cohorts. StarBase and miRWalk algorithms predicted the interaction networks between lncRNAs and microRNAs, while transcription factor (TF) binding was determined through ChIP-seq analysis and TF databases to map the regulatory networks governing lncRNA and miRNA expression. Four critical long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), H19, HOTAIR, MEG3, and UCA1, were differentially expressed in CML and were involved in regulating proliferation, cell death, and therapeutic response pathways. Network analysis revealed extensive regulatory interactions with microRNAs, especially hsa-miR-18a-5p and hsa-miR-106b-5p, which influence major oncogenic pathways. TFs mapping identified pivotal hubs, including MYC and STAT5A, as key regulators of lncRNA and miRNA networks, which contribute to disrupted normal growth control, and apoptotic and survival pathways in leukemic cells. This study identified a non-coding RNA interactome in CML involving lncRNAs and microRNAs that may cooperatively contribute to CML progression. These interconnected circuits offer novel insights into treatment resistance and stem cell persistence, identifying promising therapeutic targets. Future validation of these interactions may guide the development of non-coding RNA–targeted therapies for resistant CML.},

  abstract = {The pervasive challenges in cancer management, ranging from accurate early diagnosis to effective personalised therapies and precise patient stratification, represent significant clinical unmet needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cancer research by offering unprecedented capabilities in analysing complex genomic datasets. AI has completely transformed omics research by simplifying the integration of multi-omics data, offering more profound insights into cancer heterogeneity, and enhancing predictive models for patient treatment responses. In the past decade, numerous studies have highlighted how AI has revolutionised omics research. AI models are instrumental in enhancing oncology by addressing these unmet needs through improved clinical trial matching, refined risk assessment, and precise treatment selection. They contribute to more personalised and effective cancer care by classifying cancer types and subtypes, identifying biomarkers, predicting drug responses, stratifying patients, and analysing tumour evolution and heterogeneity. This comprehensive review specifically focuses on the development and validation of AI-powered multi-omics language models for cancer genomics. We posit that the integration of diverse omics data types provides synergistic insights beyond single-omics approaches, which are critical for unravelling cancer heterogeneity and addressing the complex challenges within cancer genomics. The review highlights recent advances, current difficulties, and potential paths forward for these integrated AI approaches. We also detail the main elements of these models, such as their architectures, training plans, evaluation techniques, and data preprocessing. All things considered, multi-omics language models powered by AI hold immense promise for deriving biological insights from intricate cancer genomic data and converting them into actionable information for clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important bioactive signaling molecule that activates six distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), among which the LPA1 subtype possesses high therapeutic target potential due to its critical roles in malignant tumors, pulmonary fibrosis, inflammation, and neuropathic pain. Recent studies have shown that the small molecule ONO-0740556 can effectively disrupt the overall structure of LPA1 in solution; however, its effects in a native membrane environment remain unclear. According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMS), Dan Shen(Salvia miltiorrhiza) exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-pulmonary fibrosis properties, and its natural compound cryptoxanthin may serve as a novel LPA1 inhibitor. Here, we employed microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to systematically compare the structural modulation of LPA1 by ONO-0740556 and cryptoxanthin in a membrane environment. The results indicate that both ligands enlarge the entrance of the LPA1 ligand-binding channel, weaken the interactions between transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) and other structural communities, and reduce hydrophobic interactions between LPA1 and the membrane, thereby inducing membrane structural perturbations. Notably, cryptoxanthin exerts a more pronounced effect in widening the binding channel and selectively attenuating TM7–community interactions. These findings provide atomic-level insights into how small molecules modulate LPA1 structure in its physiologically relevant membrane environment. Such mechanistic understanding not only offers a theoretical basis for the rational design of LPA1-targeted therapeutics but also supports the discovery of natural product–derived inhibitors as viable drug candidates. Moreover, our results highlight potential allosteric sites and dynamic features of LPA1 that could be exploited to develop highly selective modulators, paving the way for more precise therapeutic interventions against LPA1-related diseases.},

Integrating multi-omics biological data offers a comprehensive and intricate understanding of biological processes, disease mechanisms, and cancer subtyping, rendering it an influential tool for scientific research. Nevertheless, current approaches to integrating multi-omics data often fail to consider the scale of data in feature information and overlook the analysis of the individual and shared feature expressions in multi-omics data. The proposed study introduces a Multiview-Cooperated graph neural network (MCgnn), an end-to-end cancer subtype classifier that effectively integrates and analyzes complex multi-omics data. Firstly, MCgnn innovatively constructs a similarity network using Mahalanobis distance and density methods. Then, by employing stacked graph convolution layers, MCgnn effectively captures potential local structural features. Subsequently, MCgnn extracts and fuses complementary information from different omics data through the attention mechanism among views to achieve effective integration of multiple views and attain higher classification performance. Finally, MCgnn performs multi-task learning across omics data using a cross-omics tensor to seamlessly integrate the feature learning component with the classification component. Experiments on four publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were conducted to demonstrate that MCgnn outperforms most comparison classification algorithms in effectively addressing the cancer subtype classification problem and exhibits remarkable robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, MCgnn was employed to identify pivotal biomarkers in cancer, providing a valuable reference for precision medicine.},

We searched databases for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the PFC of individuals with AUD and matched controls, to identify hub and bottleneck genes through a protein-protein interaction network and topological analysis. DrugBank was used to provide candidate drugs targeting the key genes obtained. Metascape was used for gene annotations and functional enrichment analysis. Most DEPs identified in the PFC of individuals with AUD were downregulated (68 %) and were associated with metabolic processes, including aerobic respiration, vesicle-mediated transport, and cellular responses to stress. We also identified key genes through survival analysis, particularly GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and ACTB (Actin Beta). The DrugBank database identified that artenimol and quercetin are potential candidate drugs for interacting with key genes in the PFC of individuals with AUD. Thus, reduced PFC metabolism may alter executive functions, decision-making, and behaviors in individuals with AUD.

The approach constructs component-wise sign-based statistics. Leveraging the global symmetry inherent in these statistics enables the derivation of data-driven thresholds suitable for multiple testing scenarios. Method development occurs within the framework of U-statistics, which naturally encompasses existing cumulative sum-based procedures. Theoretical guarantees establish FDR control for the component-wise sign-based method under mild assumptions.

Protein Network mapping, Density Functional Theory, Molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine thebinding affinity and interactions stability of key phytochemicals with AHR, such as safranal and bisabolone oxide A. In-silico ADMET predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity showed good properties for these molecules. In addition, their structuraland pharmacological properties were optimized to enhance drug-like features by using artificial intelligence (AI) generative model. Collectively, our findings highlight these AI-enhanced phytochemicals as promising AHR modulators with potentially therapeutic activities in pathological pathways that lead toneuroinflammation and oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of dementia. They offer an avenue for additional experimental validation and encourage further investigation of these leads as sources of new therapeutic modalities to treat neurodegenerativediseases.},

  abstract = {Elevated temperatures during gear grinding readily induce workpiece surface quality degradation, diminished machining accuracy, and premature tool wear, consequently constraining processing efficiency and escalating manufacturing costs. Ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (UVAG) technology, as a powerful thermal mitigation strategy, demonstrates considerable promise for enhancing grinding process stability and improving workpiece surface quality. However, a systematic understanding of the influence mechanism of UVAG on the grinding temperature field and its efficacy optimization in gear machining remains inadequately supported by current theoretical and experimental investigations. To address this gap, this study establishes a theoretical model for the temperature field in gear ultrasonic vibration-assisted form grinding (G-UVAG). The model combines a triangular distribution of heat flux density with the unique characteristics of UVAG. The model incorporates the modulation mechanism of ultrasonic vibration on heat flux distribution, thereby enabling a more precise characterization of the transient heat field in the grinding zone. The findings reveal excellent agreement between the flank temperature predicted by the model and experimentally measured values. In contrast to conventional grinding (CG) methods, the G-UVAG technique achieves a reduction of up to 40 % in the maximum temperature observed within the grinding zone. The deviation among simulation and experimental results is constrained within 9.8 % for CG and 12 % for G-UVAG. Furthermore, G-UVAG effectively diminishes the heat-affected zone depth, shortens the duration of the temperature peak within the tooth flank contact zone, and accelerates both the heating and cooling rates. Analysis indicates that ultrasonic vibration not only promotes a more homogeneous distribution of the grinding heat source but also effectively mitigates the risks of thermally induced deformation and surface burn by suppressing localized temperature spikes. This study establishes an essential theoretical basis for precision gear grinding while broadening the application avenues of UVAG technology to support the realization of efficient and high-quality gear production.},

  abstract = {The motor control board has various defects such as inconsistent color differences, incorrect plug-in positions, solder short circuits, and more. These defects directly affect the performance and stability of the motor control board, thereby having a negative impact on product quality. Therefore, studying the defect detection technology of the motor control board is an important means to improve the quality control level of the motor control board. Firstly, the processing methods of digital images about the motor control board were studied, and the noise suppression methods that affect image feature extraction were analyzed. Secondly, a specific model for defect feature extraction and color difference recognition of the tested motor control board was established, and qualified or defective products were determined based on feature thresholds. Thirdly, the search algorithm for defective images was optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on the typical motor control board, and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing established in this paper reached over 99 %. It is suitable for timely image processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line, and achieved efficient defect detection. The defect detection method can not only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the industry.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient temporal splitting scheme coupled with explicit-implicit-null (EIN) method for nonlinear time fractional multiscale diffusion equations with generalized kernel functions. To avoid the iterative method for nonlinear problems at each time step, the idea of EIN is to add and subtract a linear term to the original equation and apply implicit and explicit time marching scheme to the linear damping term and other terms, respectively. To handle the multiscale feature in the linear part, we further introduce a partially explicit temporal splitting scheme and construct two multiscale subspaces by means of the nonlocal multi-continua method to speed up the computation. The splitting schemes treat implicitly the subspace containing the high contrast and explicitly the other. We perform a rigorous stability analysis of the proposed algorithm and give the stability condition. Several numerical experiments are presented to confirm our theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy while reducing computational cost for high contrast problems.},

In this research, MediFlora-Net, a novel Deep Learning (DL) model is created and ideal for the accurate identification of medicinal plants. The proposed MediFlora-Net uses multi-modal DL methodologies, quantum-assisted feature extraction and hybrid ensembling methodologies in constructing the plant recognition model. Besides, the methodology uses Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Proposed Med-Plant-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This makes the framework to be capable of handling multiple imaging modalities such as RGB, and Hyperspectral Botanical Imagery. Also, a new quantum-inspired feature extraction technique is integrated into the model in which quantum probabilistic feature mapping and entanglement-based representation are utilized to extract higher-order botanical features. The framework also includes separate ‘feature fusion’, fine-tuned attention, and probabilistic decision-making. The proposed MediFlora-Net advances medicinal plant identification to greater precision and flexibility for practical use in the conservation of biological diversity, ethnobotanical studies, and pharmacology. This work effectively exploits DL techniques and quantum-inspired approaches to tackle the inherent issues of botanical identification to enable the design of better-advanced systems of plant identification.

Cancer is a neoplastic disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation. The objective of this work is to develop an accurate and efficient numerical framework for analyzing the dynamics of tumor cells, immune cells, normal cells, and chemotherapeutic drugs under the influence of memory effects inherent in biological systems. The Caputo-Fabrizio fractional operator, which employs an exponential kernel without singularity, is particularly suitable for modeling such memory-dependent processes in cancer progression and treatment response. The proposed methods are applied to a system modeling the interactions among tumor cells, immune cells, normal cells, and chemotherapeutic drugs. The numerical solutions are illustrated through 2D and 3D graphical representations, and comparative simulations are presented in tabular form, demonstrating the efficiency and consistency of the CFq-EHATT and CFEADM. The results highlight the influence of the fractional order on the system dynamics, offering deeper insights into chemotherapy optimization and tumor evolution, thus contributing to the advancement of mathematical oncology.

  abstract = {Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, necessitating the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods. Formaldehyde (FA) has emerged as a potential biomarker for early detection of breast cancer in urine. This study explores the efficacy of boron-nitrogen-doped C60 heterofullerenes (BN(5,6)C58 and BN(6,6)C58) as highly sensitive and selective biosensors for FA detection using density functional theory (DFT). A comprehensive set of electronic, thermodynamic, and quantum chemical descriptors was employed to evaluate the sensing potential. Key computed parameters (including a significantly reduced energy gap (HLG = 0.49 eV), a high adsorption energy (Eads = −12.55 kcal/mol), a favorable Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = −12.73 kcal/mol), an enhanced dipole moment (μ = 7.425 D), increased polarizability (α = 525.640), and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis) collectively confirmed that BN doping significantly enhances the interaction strength with FA, with BN(6,6)C58 exhibiting the highest sensitivity (1.9 ×1017). Electronic property analyses demonstrated a reduced energy gap and enhanced charge transfer in BN(6,6)C58@FA, corroborated by molecular electrostatic potential and NCI analyses. The sensor's rapid recovery time (1.65 ×10−3 s) and high electrical conductivity (16 A.m−2) further underscore its potential for real-time breath analysis. These findings highlight BN(6,6)C58 as a promising candidate for non-invasive breast cancer diagnostics, paving the way for developing advanced electrochemical biosensors.},

The present study explores natural cyanobacterial compounds as possible inhibitors of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase B (GyrB) which is a verified antibacterial target that is not present in higher eukaryotes. Because of the urgent need for novel antibacterial drugs, we identified nine drug-like candidates using lipinski's rule of five and ADMET profiling. Molecular docking revealed that Biselyngbyaside B and Smenamide A exhibited greater binding affinities in comparison to the co-crystallized inhibitor EOF, with a binding energy of −9.03 kcal/mol. Further molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Biselyngbyaside B-DNA gyrase B complex surpassed both EOF and Smenamide A in terms of structural stability, compactness, and strong hydrogen bonding. Umbrella sampling was employed to estimate the binding free energy from thirty sampling simulations, and Biselyngbyaside B exhibited a significantly favourable ΔG bind of −91.66 kJ/mol, outperforming EOF (-68.93 kJ/mol) and Smenamide A (-36.4 kJ/mol). These findings clearly indicate a stronger and more stable interaction between Biselyngbyaside B and GyrB. Biselyngbyaside B continuously showed better pharmacokinetic characteristics, non-hepatotoxicity, and a greater binding affinity than previously documented DNA gyrase B inhibitors. This study emphasizes the integration of molecular dockings, molecular dynamics simulation, umbrella sampling, and ADMET analysis provided crucial quantitative insights into the identification of potent drug-like candidates for further validation. Overall, the Biselyngbyaside B was found to be the most promising lead compound for novel antibacterial drug development targeting DNA gyrase B.},

This study examined the relationship between fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and social anxiety in parents of children with ASD, with a focus on the mediating roles of perceived social support and coping styles. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 585 parents of children with ASD using validated instruments: the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE), the Social Anxiety Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Simple Coping Style Questionnaire. Data were analyzed through SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 25.0 for structural equation modeling. Key findings revealed: (1) FNE directly predicted social anxiety, with significant standardized direct effects of 0.179 and 0.159 across tested models (p < 0.001); (2) Perceived social support, positive coping styles, and negative coping styles each partially mediated the FNE–social anxiety relationship, with indirect effects of 0.035 (95 % CI [0.025, 0.066]), 0.096 (95 % CI [0.181, 0.242]), and 0.110 (95 % CI [0.115, 0.126]), respectively; (3) Significant chain mediation pathways emerged through perceived social support → positive coping styles (effect = 0.008, 95 % CI [0.012, 0.016]) and perceived social support → negative coping styles (effect = 0.014, 95 % CI [0.031, 0.033]). These findings elucidate the mechanisms linking FNE to social anxiety in this population and provide theoretical foundations for targeted interventions to mitigate parental distress.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital animation industry, the role of dynamic light and shadow effects in improving the visual expressiveness of animation works has become increasingly prominent. However, traditional light and shadow design methods often rely on manual adjustment, which is inefficient and difficult to achieve complex dynamic effects. Therefore, this study proposes an animation effect design model based on a dynamic light and shadow algorithm, aiming at achieving efficient and realistic light and shadow effects through algorithm-driven. Firstly, the limitations of existing light and shadow algorithms in animation applications are analyzed, and then a dynamic light and shadow algorithm which combines a physical illumination model and artistic style is designed according to the characteristics of animation art. The algorithm calculates the position, intensity, and surface properties of the light source in real-time and generates light and shadow effects that conform to the animation style. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, an experimental platform was constructed in this study, and various animation scenes were tested. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional manual design, the model improves the efficiency of light and shadow effect generation by about 60%, and at the same time, it won more than 80% of the audience’s praise in the visual effect satisfaction survey. In addition, the research also optimizes the performance of the model. By introducing parallel computing and caching mechanisms, the light and shadow generation time is further shortened, and the resource consumption is reduced. This study not only provides a new technical path for animation light and shadow design but also provides a useful reference for the research in related fields.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, the importance of English word sense comparison classification has become increasingly prominent in areas such as semantic understanding and machine translation. The research results in this field play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of language processing systems. However, most existing English word sense comparison classification methods currently have significant shortcomings when dealing with complex semantic relationships. They struggle to accurately capture long-distance dependencies between words and exhibit weak discrimination capabilities when handling polysemy and synonyms, posing challenges in building high-performance comparison classification systems. The limitations of existing methods are mainly reflected in two aspects: on one hand, traditional models find it difficult to effectively extract semantic features when processing long sentences and complex semantic structures; on the other hand, a single model cannot simultaneously account for sequence information retention and long-distance dependency capture, leading to limited classification accuracy. This research focuses on these issues by proposing the construction of an English word sense comparison classification system using Transformer and LSTM. The self-attention mechanism of the Transformer can effectively capture long-distance dependencies between words, enhancing the ability to extract semantic features; the memory functionality of LSTM preserves sequence information, and the combination of the two optimizes classification performance. In our experiments, we constructed an English word sense comparison dataset containing 10,000-word pairs and used cross-validation for evaluation. The results show that, compared to the classification accuracy of the single Transformer model at 80.2% and the LSTM model at 78.9%, the Transformer LSTM model improved the classification accuracy to 85.6%, achieving an average percentage improvement of 5.4% and 6.7%. In the comparison tasks dealing with polysemy and synonyms, the model reached accuracies of 88.3% and 86.1%, respectively, demonstrating excellent discrimination capabilities and stable performance in handling complex semantic relationships and long sentences, significantly outperforming traditional models.},

Compressed code stream video encryption is an advanced method designed to enhance security and protection by encrypting video data at the compressed code stream level. Leveraging the advantages of compressed video streams, this approach maximizes encryption efficiency without compromising playback speed or video quality. In this research, we first compress the raw video data into a compressed code stream using the H.264/AVC technique. A common method encodes multiple independent slices into a video. We utilize this functionality to implement the ChaCha20 stream cipher for encryption. The cryptographic key derivation function (KDF) generates and updates the key dynamically. To enhance the security of video encryption, we propose a novel multi-key verifiable homomorphic lightweight cryptosystem (MKVHLC) to guarantee data privacy.

While most research has concentrated on non-residential buildings, less attention has been given to optimizing ventilation in residential settings. This study examines a typical ventilation system in a detached house in British Columbia, Canada, using Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing airborne infection risks. The study investigates eight different scenarios, varying diffuser locations (near the ceiling and floor), two types of ventilation rates based on standards, and the positioning of the infected individual while considering flow, heat, and particle dynamics. The concentration of injected and distributed particles is used to assess infection probabilities as an additional risk indicator. In addition, the Wells-Riley model is applied to quantify the infection probability. The results indicate that the location of the infected person and diffuser placement significantly impact particle dispersion and infection risk, with near-ceiling outlets generally reducing concentrations more effectively than near-floor outlets. Higher ventilation rates decrease particle concentration when diffusers are near the ceiling but can increase concentrations with near-floor diffusers due to turbulence. Optimizing diffuser placement and ventilation rates is crucial for minimizing airborne transmission in residential settings.},

  abstract = {With the rapid use of electric vehicles (EVs), the need for intelligent and real-time fault diagnosis systems for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has become critical to ensure safety, efficiency, and extended operational life. Numerous existing fault diagnosis approaches often require complex computations and fail to adapt to nonlinear, dynamic EV conditions. In addition, data-driven models lack real-time capability, exhibit high computational overhead, and are rarely optimized for embedded deployment. This research presents a hybrid DL-based diagnostic framework named Optimized Elman Spotted Hyena Tuned NeuroNet (OESH-Net) for accurate State of Charge (SOC) estimation and fault detection in EV battery systems. The proposed model integrates a Thevenin-equivalent circuit-based LIB model simulated in MATLAB with a recurrent Elman Neural Network (ENN) optimized using the Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO) in TensorFlow/Keras. High-frequency sensor data, including voltage, current, temperature, motor speed, and hall signals, are collected and preprocessed using low-pass filtering, sliding window segmentation, and min-max normalization, to create structured feature vectors. Then, the preprocessed data are fed into the OESH-Net for SOC prediction and health classification into Normal, Warning, and Fault states based on residual SOC error thresholds. Experimental results shows that OESH-Net outperforms models’ sin both charging and discharging phases, achieving 98.86% accuracy, 99.22% F1-score, 0.00078 MSE, and 4.85 ms inference time. It maintains robust performance with a mean absolute SOC estimation error of 2.06%. The proposed OESH-Net framework enables predictive maintenance and early fault detection, offering a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for smart EV battery management systems.},

The system aggregates data from student surveys, instructor evaluations, learning management system logs, and classroom observations, enabling a holistic view of the teaching and learning environment. Textual data is preprocessed using natural language techniques (NLP), such as cleaning and tokenization. To address data imbalance challenges, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed, ensuring equal representation across various performance levels and enhancing model generalizability. Feature extraction is performed using Word2Vec, which captures semantic relationships within the feedback to generate rich vector representations. A Modified Migrating Birds Optimizer-driven Attention-based Recurrent neural network (MMB-Att-RNN) model is used to evaluate vocational education quality, which enables collaborative, distributed training across multiple institutions while preserving data privacy. An integrated attention mechanism helps the model focus on the most relevant features within the feedback, thereby improving prediction accuracy and interpretability.

  abstract = {Chinese figure painting, with its rich history and diverse styles, represents a significant cultural heritage that captures the essence of Chinese art and aesthetics. However, many traditional figure painting styles, particularly rare ones, remain underrepresented and face considerable challenges in modern-day recognition, categorization, and preservation. This issue is especially prominent in the context of few-shot learning, where models must classify and identify rare categories with only minimal training data. To address this challenge, the research proposes a novel meta-learning-optimized deep feature fusion strategy for the few-shot classification of rare Chinese figure painting styles. The research utilizes a Chinese art styles dataset of Chinese figure paintings, with a specific focus on rare and fine-grained styles. Preprocessing steps such as image resizing and noise removal were employed to enhance data quality. The ResNet-50 model was utilized to extract low-level characteristics from the input images, such as edges, textures, and colors. The features extracted from different layers were then fused using deep feature fusion techniques to create a comprehensive and discriminative representation of the painting styles. This feature fusion process was further optimized through a meta-learning approach based on the Elephant Clan Optimized Attention-based Variational Autoencoder (ECO-Att-VAE) method, which fine-tunes feature weighting based on the support set in the few-shot classification task. Experiments show that the suggested strategy works noticeably better than current methods in the categorization of unusual art styles. Results show that the model achieves a notable improvement in classification accuracy, providing a robust and effective solution for few-shot classification in the domain of rare Chinese figure painting styles.},

Influencing factors of tourism efficiency were further examined through a Tobit model. The results indicate that, from a static efficiency perspective, only Chizhou was strongly DEA efficient, while the remaining 15 cities were DEA inefficient.

In the regional dimension, the Central Anhui region exhibited the highest tourism efficiency, followed by Southern Anhui, with Northern Anhui displaying the lowest efficiency levels. Economic development and transportation accessibility were found to promote tourism efficiency, while the degree of openness and tourism resource endowment exerted a suppressive effect.

Traditional sentiment analysis models often fail to capture the depth and nuance of these texts, limiting their effectiveness in literary interpretation and digital humanities research. This research aims to develop a deep learning (DL)-based RoCoSenti-Classical framework tailored to classical Chinese literature, capable of accurately identifying and classifying sentiments despite the language’s complexity and historical nature. A comprehensive corpus of classical Chinese literary texts was gathered from reputable digital sources. The text data underwent pre-processing steps, including text normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal. Domain-specific language representations were created by fine-tuning RoBERTa embeddings on the classical corpus. These embeddings were then input into a ConvLSTM model, which combines convolutional layers for local feature extraction with LSTM layers for progressive sentiment modeling. Implemented in Python, the findings show that the RoCoSenti-Classical framework performs better than multimodal baseline architectures, achieving superior results with accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision ranging from 90% to 97%. The suggested RoCoSenti-Classical framework effectively captures complex emotional cues in classical texts, demonstrating robustness across different literary genres and significantly improving sentiment analysis performance for classical Chinese literature. These findings support the broader integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital humanities and open new avenues for the computational interpretation of ancient texts.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Topological Optimization Homotopy Framework (TOHF) and provide the first rigorous proof of its global convergence to solve the non-convex optimization challenges in high-dimensional tensor decomposition. TOHF transforms the tensor algebraic structure into topological invariants to construct two-layer manifold optimization paths with global guidance. By integrating homotopy parameter scheduling and curvature correction, it overcomes the saddle-dominated energy landscape. Theoretically, TOHF achieves global convergence under the Wasserstein topological distance. Experiments in recommender systems, medical imaging, and neural network compression show that TOHF provides significant improvements in accuracy and convergence efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively mitigating local minima traps, accelerating objective function descent, and enhancing solution set stability. This study establishes a topology-based convergence analysis paradigm for high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems, which is of theoretical guidance for large-scale data processing applications.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of globalization, intangible cultural heritage has become an important resource for protecting national culture and promoting social development. However, research on its geographical distribution and potential mechanisms is still insufficient, especially in the use of spatial statistics and geographic information systems for analysis and management. This study uses GIS technology and spatial statistical methods, including spatial autocorrelation, hotspot analysis, and geographically weighted regression (GWR), to explore the spatial distribution of China’s intangible cultural heritage. This study analyzed data from national intangible cultural heritage projects to reveal regional characteristics and distribution patterns. The research results show that intangible cultural heritage has significant regional agglomeration, with high-density areas concentrated in the eastern coastal areas and around major cities, while the density is lower in the western and remote areas. In addition, factors such as geographical location, economic development, and population density have a significant impact on distribution. About 55% of intangible cultural heritage projects in China are concentrated in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial pattern of intangible cultural heritage and scientific basis for effective cultural protection and policy formulation. These findings can guide local governments in allocating resources, formulating strategies for cultural heritage protection and inheritance, especially in balancing the urban-rural gap.},

  abstract = {With the progress of globalization, English learning has become an important topic in education. However, the traditional teaching mode makes it difficult to meet individualized learning needs, resulting in uneven learning effects. Therefore, this study aims to build a personalized English learning path optimization system based on MVO-CNN (multiverse optimization-convolutional neural networks) to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness. There are some problems in English learning, such as scattered resources and single methods, which are difficult to adapt to the characteristics and needs of different learners. As an advanced artificial intelligence technology, MVO-CNN can effectively process complex learning data and provide strong support for personalized learning. In the system construction process, we first collected English learning data, including learners’ basic information, study habits, and achievement records. Then, MVO-CNN is used to mine and analyze the data deeply to identify the key factors affecting the learning effect. Based on these factors, the system generates personalized learning paths for each learner, including recommended learning resources, learning plans and learning methods. We conducted a 3-month experiment with 500 learners participating to verify the system’s effectiveness. The experimental results show that learners who use personalized learning paths have an average improvement of 15% in English scores, a 20% reduction in learning time and a 30% increase in learning satisfaction. In addition, the system’s recommendation accuracy rate reaches 85%, better than the 60% of the traditional teaching mode.

Traditional recommendation algorithms often face problems such as insufficient feature extraction and low recommendation accuracy when dealing with large-scale and high-dimensional music data. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent music personalized recommendation algorithm based on efficient feature extraction of MLP-Mixer. The algorithm uses MLP-Mixer’s multi-layer perceptron network to effectively capture deep-seated features in music data, thereby improving the accuracy and diversity of the recommendation system. In the experimental session, we constructed a dataset containing 100,000 songs and 1 million user ratings, using mean square error (MSE) and Accuracy as evaluation indicators. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional recommendation algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the MSE index by 15% and improves the Accuracy index by 8%. In addition, the user satisfaction survey shows that the user satisfaction of the recommendation system using the new algorithm has increased by 12%, significantly enhancing the user experience. This study not only verifies the effectiveness of MLP-Mixer in music feature extraction but also provides a new technical path for intelligent music personalized recommendation.},

The methodology involved an experiment conducted with 60 fourth-year students at Kyrgyz State University named after I. Arabaev. The experiment employed pedagogical technologies, including the flipped classroom model, the Case method and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. These approaches enabled students to actively engage with the material, develop cognitive abilities, and deepen their understanding of the educational process. The study’s primary findings indicate that the use of educational robots significantly enhances students’ levels of critical and creative thinking. During the experiment, students who worked with robots demonstrated superior performance in areas such as solving complex problems, improving programming skills and developing algorithmic thinking. The increased effectiveness of the educational process is attributed to the interactive and practice-oriented nature of robotics, which enables students to not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also apply it in practical contexts. Furthermore, participation in such processes fosters the development of additional skills, including teamwork, rapid decision-making and adaptability to changing conditions. A notable feature of using digital technologies in education is the substantial motivation they inspire in students. This is evidenced by their heightened activity, greater engagement with the subject, and improved performance in task completion, which collectively contribute to better assimilation of the material.

However, contrary to expectations, the initiatives had an adverse effect on employee engagement levels.

The researchers applied systems thinking approach and arrived at six major challenges faced by TEC. The findings indicate that the root cause of all the challenges is the lack of an overarching structure or strategy that could enable organisational agility.

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of digital music content, efficient and accurate methods for music feature extraction and style generation have become critical research areas in music information processing. Traditional manual labeling methods are insufficient to manage large-scale music data due to their inefficiency and subjectivity. Deep learning technologies, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown significant promise in capturing temporal and stylistic characteristics of musical sequences. This paper introduces an integrated framework that combines spectral and cepstral analyses—applying short-time Fourier transform on overlapping 20 ms frames with 10 ms hops and extracting log-power cepstrum plus Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)—to systematically derive pitch, resonance peaks, and timbre features. These handcrafted vectors are concatenated with learned embeddings and fed into a bidirectional LSTM, enabling the model to leverage both explicit frequency-domain cues and long-range temporal dependencies. By processing each sequence in forward and backward directions, the bidirectional LSTM outperforms unidirectional variants in genre classification accuracy and produces more coherent musical transitions. In tests on five genres (Jazz, Classical, Rock, Country, and Disco), our framework achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.2%, an F1-score of 0.79, and a Mean Opinion Score of 4.1/5 for stylistic coherence in a blind listening study. Additionally, quantitative evaluation of harmonic progression consistency (85% retention of original chord transitions) and dynamic contour reproduction (Pearson correlation of 0.82 with source note velocities) demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize to non-genre-specific musical elements. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method generates high-quality, stylistically faithful music across diverse genres, offering an automated, efficient solution for both music analysis and creative generation.},

A comprehensive analysis of research on healthy cities can provide valuable insights into the current state of the field and guide future development directions. This study utilizes the CiteSpace literature analysis tool and examines literature from the Web of Science and CNKI databases over the past three decades to identify relevant research papers. Employing visual analytics techniques, it explores research hotspots, authors, and institutions to extract key findings and identify areas for further improvement in the research of healthy cities. The analysis reveals several important observations: Firstly, international research primarily focuses on individual health from a biomedical perspective, while Chinese studies place greater emphasis on the impact of the built environment and urban planning, yet less consideration is given to the psychological consideration of human health. Secondly, the major of professional international authors in the field of urban health are concentrated in Europe and Australia, where influential Chinese authors are mainly affiliated with institutions in Shanghai and Beijing, indicating the regional characteristics of China’s health city research and its concentrated development in these cities. This statistical result reveals the differences in contributions of different regions in the field of health city research, while reflecting the geographical distribution bias of research resources and forces. Furthermore, universities are the dominant research institutions in both Chinese and international contexts. Lastly, this study synthesizes the theoretical foundations, empirical results, construction evaluation, and governance measures of healthy cities, and provides four constructive suggestions for future development: refining the theoretical framework of healthy cities, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, expanding the assessment system and methods, and implementing comprehensive governance strategies that encompass various dimensions of health.},

  abstract = {Predicting crack propagation in a composite airfield pavement is a computationally challenging task. This study presents the development of a fracture-based modeling approach to capture crack propagation in an asphalt concrete (AC) overlay on jointed Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement structure. A four-stage numerical framework was developed to predict thermal induced joint reflective cracking. The framework leverages a combination of finite difference methods, finite element (FE) thermo-mechanical modeling, and the Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) coupled with the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (EVCP). FE thermo-mechanical and GFEM fracture simulations were solved in 3-D. Performing the simulations in 3-D domain shows the non-uniformity of PCC joint movement through the depth and width of the concrete slabs. The results show that this non-uniformity is mainly influenced by AC stiffness and thermal expansion/contraction. Simplified design models were prepared for joint opening under different cooling cycles. GFEM s adaptive meshing and global-local analysis enable accurate calculation of stress intensity factors from the elastic solution. Application of EVCP provided the ability to address the critical challenges of incorporating 3-D viscoelastic analysis within the framework. Using EVCP viscoelastic ERR can be calculated for various AC mixtures and cooling cycles using a limited set of elastic solutions. The framework was validated using FAA outdoor test section for joint reflective cracking at the National Airport Pavement Test Facility. Thermal reflective cracking performance for different overlay scenarios was simulated in four different climatic regions, highlighting the framework s ability of capturing the effect of pavement structure and climate on overlay fatigue life.},

This study details the design and implementation of an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) pedagogical framework for mental health courses in higher vocational education settings. The research addresses the limitations of conventional pedagogical approaches through the use of immersive VR technology to create experiential learning spaces that foster the development of psychological resilience. Through a mixed-methods research design, we created an extensive VR-based curriculum with four main modules: stress management simulation, social interaction training, problem-solving under pressure, and exercises on emotional regulation. A 12 week experiment was carried out with 200 higher vocational students, comparing the effects of the VR intervention group with a control group receiving conventional instruction. Quantitative results revealed significant improvements in psychological resilience scores (Cohen’s d = 0.78,

  abstract = {Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face significant difficulties in emotional expression and recognition, and traditional manual observation methods struggle to capture their weak and transient micro-expression features. To address this issue, this paper proposes an autism emotion recognition model that integrates Vision Transformer with multimodal features. The model first employs the TVL1 optical flow algorithm to extract facial motion features and utilizes Vision Transformer to model long-range dependencies between different facial regions. Subsequently, it introduces a feature selection fusion module (FSFM) to filter key image patches, a cross-attention fusion module (CAFM) to integrate horizontal and vertical optical flow information, and designs a spatial consistency attention module (SCAM) to ensure feature distribution consistency. Finally, it incorporates Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML) to optimize the feature space structure. On standard micro-expression databases including MMEW, CASMEII, and SAMM, this method achieves recognition accuracies significantly superior to existing approaches (73.0%, 76.4%, and 70.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates good generalization capability and real-time performance, showing promise as an intelligent assistive tool for special education to enhance teachers’ understanding of emotional states in children with autism and improve intervention efficiency, thereby promoting personalized education development.},

  abstract = {As technology advances, the demands for precise industrial product manufacturing increase. Consequently, measuring instruments have also improved in accuracy. To ensure that the measurement accuracy of the three-coordinate measuring instrument meets modern industrial manufacturing’s precision measurement requirements, the quantity traceability method is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy of angle error. And the geometric error compensation method is used to improve the measurement accuracy of the coordinate measuring instrument. By establishing a complete, accurate, and reliable traceability chain, the coordinate measuring instrument has traceability and calibration functions. Error compensation improves the geometric error in the coordinate measuring instrument through operation command correction. The results showed that the phase relationship of the measurement error of the self-calibrating encoder was basically consistent with the design value. Compared to the R1 reading head, the deviation value of the R6 reading head was the smallest, at 0.1°. The deviation value of the R4 and R5 reading heads was larger, at 0.4° compared to the R1 reading head. The deviation values of the R2 and R3 reading heads compared to the R1 reading head were 0.3° and 0.2°, respectively. The precision error compensation model had a higher degree of error identification and accuracy. In measuring errors in the three axes, the outcomes of the traditional error model show greater variability as the displacement increases. The method of error compensation in the measurement system effectively improves accuracy by reducing errors. This method not only proves the feasibility of accuracy improvement but also provides guidance for further enhancements of the measurement system’s accuracy.},

These features are separately fed into the corresponding spatial and temporal branches of the network for pre-training and subsequent feature extraction. A parallel fusion mechanism is then applied to integrate the outputs from both streams, thereby enriching the descriptive power of the learned features. For the final stage, an improved anisotropic Markov random field model is employed for network training and result refinement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets—UCF101, HMDB51—as well as a proprietary Fujian electric power measurement action dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior robustness and high recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

The study first analyzes regional transportation issues and establishes a model of upper level influencing factors based on the current situation. Next, the study considers the balanced configuration of lower level transportation and constructs a lower level planning model. Finally, the study introduces linear constraint method and improved genetic algorithm to solve the two-layer model. In genetic algorithm optimization training, the search performance reaches its optimal level when the crossover probability is 0.9 and the population size is 40.

However, traditional semantic alignment methods are often limited by model size and computational efficiency, and it isn’t easy to meet the dual requirements of real-time and accuracy. This study aims to improve the performance of cross-border English text semantic alignment through BERT-INT8 quantitative model. We first perform INT8 quantization processing on the BERT model, significantly reducing the model parameters and computational complexity. The experimental results show that the semantic alignment accuracy of the optimized model has improved by 5.2% to 92.7%. The processing speed has been increased by 1.8 times, reaching the speed of processing 3000-word pairs per second. The average alignment accuracy on different types of text reached 90.5%, which was 4.3 percentage points higher than that of the unoptimized model. These results show that the BERT-INT8 quantization model significantly improves the processing efficiency while maintaining high alignment accuracy, with strong generalization ability and robustness. This study provides a new technical path for fast and accurate alignment of cross-border English texts, which can play an important role in practical applications.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the design and optimization of urban public space have become the key to improving urban quality and residents’ quality of life. This study explores the optimal urban public space design strategy based on GIS (geographic information system) and spatial behavior analysis. The research background lies in the problems of low efficiency, single function and traffic congestion in urban public spaces. Through GIS technology, the spatial analysis of urban public space is carried out. The residents’ usage habits are understood by combining spatial behavior analysis, and the optimization design strategy is put forward. The experimental results show that after optimizing the spatial layout, the use efficiency of public space increased by 25%; the functional configuration increased in leisure and entertainment areas, and the average daily flow of people in public spaces is increased by 40%. Improved traffic organization, reduced congestion points, and improved the accessibility of public space by 30%. This study confirms the effectiveness of GIS and spatial behavior analysis in the optimal public space design.

  abstract = {With the increasingly refined and intelligent requirements for lighting and sound in dance performances, the traditional synchronous control methods of lighting and sound have made it difficult to meet the complex needs of stage performances. This study proposes a lighting and sound synchronization control method based on an adaptive algorithm, which improves the system’s response speed and synchronization accuracy in a dynamic stage environment through technologies such as deep learning, reinforcement learning and model-free adaptive control. In the initial test of the synchronization control of light and sound in dance performance, it was found that the fit between the light brightness change and the sound rhythm was only 79.4%. In the process of stage performance, there is still much room for optimization in the synchronous control of lighting and sound. Especially in complex dance passages, there are significant delay and synchronization errors. In a dance paragraph with a duration of 18.53 s, the average delay time of light color conversion is 35.39 ms, while the delay of sound volume adjustment is 29.09 ms. With the change of stage performance rhythm, this delay problem may lead to the out-of-synchronization of the audience’s visual and auditory experience, thus affecting the expressiveness of the performance. In a specific stage scene, the movement deviation of the lighting position reaches 34.46 cm, while the spatial positioning deviation of the sound effect is 56.64 cm. In the initial test of the synchronization control of light and sound in dance performance, it was found that the fit between the light brightness change and the sound rhythm was only 79.4%. In the process of stage performance, there is still much room for optimization in the synchronous control of lighting and sound. Especially in complex dance passages—defined as segments with movement velocity exceeding 1.5 m/s, direction changes more than 3 times per second, or simultaneous variations in at least three signal modalities (e.g., dance movements, sound frequency, and light intensity)—there are significant delay and synchronization errors.},

  abstract = {Modern power systems, serving as the lifeline of societal operations, face challenges to their stability due to equipment damage and service interruptions caused by grid faults. Existing learning-based methods of-ten rely solely on structured data as features, where random fluctuations in the data can lead to overly sensitive fault predictions. To address this issue, this study innovatively integrates multi-dimensional in-formation from both structured and unstructured data, proposing the ALLA prediction framework based on the collaborative reasoning of Attention-LSTM and large language models. By dynamically filtering key features from structured data such as current and voltage through the attention mechanism, and leveraging the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models on unstructured texts like fault re-ports and maintenance logs, a dual-channel feature enhancement model is constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves an average F1 score of 0.9818 across five power grid datasets, representing a 2.4% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. This framework provides a new paradigm for resolving the sensitivity-accuracy trade-off in fault prediction under complex environments, significantly enhancing the accuracy of converter valve fault predictions.},

  abstract = {This research introduces an innovative computational framework that automatically extracts multidimensional personalized feature labels from student course reflection reports. Unlike traditional learner profiling methods that rely on questionnaires and standardized assessments, our approach leverages natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and unsupervised learning to mine naturally occurring student-generated text. The key innovation lies in our integration of computational linguistics with educational theory to identify five distinct learner profiles (Academic Analytical, Innovative Thinker, Collaborative, Optimistic Active, and Expressive Rich Learner) along with specific trait labels that capture unique cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of learning. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness through experimental validation with both student self-assessment (78.2% agreement) and instructor evaluation, confirming that algorithmically-determined classifications strongly align with human perceptions. Our methodology establishes formal mapping relationships between extracted personalized labels and specific instructional strategies, enabling educators to tailor teaching approaches to individual learning profiles. By analyzing unstructured text that students naturally produce during their educational journey, we achieve non-intrusive learner profiling that provides insight into student learning characteristics. The methodology we’ve developed establishes a foundation that could potentially be extended to capture learning development over time in future longitudinal studies with larger samples. This work contributes to the advancement of adaptive education by bridging the gap between computational data analysis and practical pedagogical interventions, ultimately supporting the development of more responsive and personalized learning environments.},

  abstract = {With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent digital art design gradually integrates multi-modal data, such as images, text, and audio, in the creative process, improving the creativity and efficiency of design. Traditional art design platforms have problems such as insufficient information fusion and low creative efficiency when dealing with multi-modal data. In order to solve these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent digital art design fusion platform based on multi-modal Transformer, which effectively fuses data of different modalities through the multi-modal Transformer architecture to improve creative efficiency and work quality. The proposed multi-modal Transformer framework is a novel approach to digital art creation, overcoming traditional limitations of single-modal platforms by integrating image, text, and audio. This multi-modal fusion significantly enhances creative efficiency by 33.3% and creativity by improving both the diversity and expressiveness of the generated artworks, primarily within a unified image resolution framework. However, the current platform is optimized for fixed resolution image generation. Handling mixed resolutions or modified images (in pixel or grid formats) presents challenges, particularly in maintaining output integrity. This limitation is recognized and will be addressed in future work through adaptive resolution techniques. The innovation lies in effectively leveraging the self-attention mechanism to balance the computational load while enriching creative outputs, addressing both artistic and technological challenges. Specific data analysis shows that the average time of three-modal fusion creation design is 80 min, while that of single-modal creation is 120 min, which proves the significant advantages of multi-modal fusion in accelerating design creation. In addition, the platform has also achieved good results in the quality of creation, and the creative score has increased by about 25% compared with the traditional platform.},

This paper relays these calls for these catastrophic times by considering the manner in which philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers has approached this problem. Proffering an extended reading of the mutations of Stengers's thought in the last decade, it argues that one of the lessons of her work is to connect the planetary catastrophe to the devastation of our knowledge-practices and the depletion of our imaginations, and to give to the catastrophe that marks the present the power to transform our ways of thinking in common. Resisting the mobilizations engendered by the question “what is to be done?”, Stengers wagers on the generative capacities of interstitial practices to regenerate forms of collective intelligence, forms capable of protecting knowing and thinking practices from capture and experimentally reactivating the imagination even amid catastrophe. In so doing, the paper proffers a mode of imagining critical STS as an accomplice to collective experiments everywhere elaborating capacities to learn, for their own reasons, through their own means, how to pose their own questions.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet technology, the digital contract is a vital medium of information dissemination. The rapid spread of rumors in Internet news communication misleads public cognition and may cause social panic and instability. This study aims to explore a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for rumor detection in news communication that integrates an attention mechanism. By enriching and advancing the theoretical framework and technical methods in the field of rumor detection, it seeks to provide more accurate and reliable information support for Internet news communication. This study first analyzes the public opinion transmission cycle of Internet news. It makes it clear that the word vector model is the key link in the natural language processing task of news rumor detection. In the task of rumor detection, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) detection model is further proposed, which takes text information as input, extracts features, and learns optimal strategies through the deep neural network, to achieve accurate recognition of rumors. The attention mechanism is integrated into the model to help it better identify the key information in the text, such as keywords, key sentences, etc., thereby improving the accuracy of detection. On the Pheme Twitter and Weibo datasets, the DQN + Attention model proposed in this study has improved accuracy by 11.09% and 10.1% compared to the Long Short-Term Memory model. Compared with the Relay Diffusion Model, the proposed model’s accuracy on the two datasets is increased by 2.5% and 0.2%, respectively. This finding demonstrates that the model can still achieve or even surpass the effectiveness of complex models that combine multiple types of information even when using only textual information. The research results have vital practical value for the field of rumor detection. They not only assist in accurately and timely identifying rumors but also provide effective rumor prevention and control measures for social media platforms.},

The existing approximate methods for this problem include traditional PID control systems and manual control mechanisms. These methods have some drawbacks, such as poor handling of nonlinear dynamics, long response times, and inability to optimize production in real time. To partially overcome these drawbacks, this manuscript proposes an implementation of a method based on deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks and long-term short-term memory networks. This method improves the performance of carbon fiber shaping machines by predicting and adjusting the filament conveying speed with higher accuracy and responsiveness. Compared with traditional PID control systems, the positive results of this method include a 38.2% improvement in control accuracy, a 22.3% reduction in response time, and a 10.5% increase in production efficiency. However, there are still some limitations, such as the challenge of integrating the system into existing manufacturing infrastructure and the need for further improvements in noise reduction technology. Future work will focus on addressing long-term system performance and maintenance, including periodic retraining of models to adapt to evolving production conditions. Regular maintenance of the system infrastructure, such as sensor calibration and data quality checks, will be necessary to ensure stable and efficient operation over extended periods.},

To enhance the accuracy of compaction degree evaluation, the latest deep learning Evo-Learn model is utilized to correct compaction parameters. This method employs a weight optimization strategy that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Backpropagation to optimize neural network weights, thereby improving model robustness and performance. Through selection, crossover, mutation, and other operations, the mixed error between the sample set and the test set is optimized, so as to improve the generalization performance of the compression prediction model and reduce overfitting.

They were instructed to write for either themselves (envisioning they would sing the final product) or for another individual (considering someone else would perform). The creativity of the lyrics was assessed using three complementary approaches: (i) self-ratings by participants, (ii) qualitative evaluations by six expert raters, and (iii) algorithmic analysis through distributional semantic modeling. Although we did not find significant differences in creativity between lyrics created for oneself and lyrics created for others, our analysis revealed that participants’ behaviors and states are more predictive of self-assessment and computational ratings of creativity than expert ratings. Furthermore, we identified a robust correlation between expert ratings and computational evaluations of the lyrics’ creativity.},

A Hybrid Model for Psychological Abnormal Student Behavior Identification (HMPABI) based on educational big data is proposed. By combining multidimensional behavioral characteristics and psychological assessment data of students during their school years, an efficient and accurate identification model for students with psychological abnormalities is constructed through clustering, oversampling techniques, and a mixed classification strategy of logistic regression and support vector machine. The study takes the Urumqi University Student Campus Behavior Dataset and the Adolescent Mental Health and Behavior Dataset for experimental verification. On the UUS-CBD dataset, the average absolute error of the HMPABI model was lower than that of other comparison models in all testing time windows, exhibiting higher prediction accuracy and stability, with a maximum error value of 0.28. In contrast, the errors of the other two models reached 0.45 and 0.42 at the maximum time window (45 min), respectively. The HMPBAI model can fully explore the potential information of students’ behavioral characteristics. By integrating different types of data, it can more accurately predict students with psychological abnormalities.

  abstract = {This study aims to explore the application of deep learning in a sports teaching model based on the flipped classroom concept to enhance student engagement and teaching effectiveness. It constructs a personalized recommendation system based on the self-attention mechanism, integrating deep learning algorithms to provide customized learning paths and resources for sports teaching. Implemented in a flipped classroom, the system collects and analyzes student learning data to optimize the personalized learning model. The study is conducted in a university sports course, dividing students into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group uses the flipped classroom model supported by the personalized recommendation system, while the control group follows the traditional teaching model. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the personalized recommendation system reaches 95.15%, significantly higher than other models (such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). The surveys indicate that the experimental group outperforms the control group in classroom participation, learning satisfaction, and problem-solving abilities, with statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). This demonstrates that the system significantly improves learning outcomes. The study concludes that the personalized recommendation system based on the self-attention mechanism can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional teaching models. This study offers valuable practical solutions for innovation in sports teaching and promotes the deep integration of educational technology and sports instruction.},

  abstract = {Economic globalization makes the technological innovation of enterprises become the key to win or lose in market competition. To improve the innovation ability of enterprises and enable them to achieve sustainable development, many enterprises have begun to carry out digital transformation (DT). Considering the financial risks existing in the DT of enterprises, a prediction model was first established based on convolution neural network (CNN) and entropy method, aiming at providing data reference for enterprises. To further study the relationship between DT and enterprise innovation (EI) development, three research hypotheses were given through theoretical analysis. The correlation was calculated by multiple linear regression. According to the results of financial risk simulation experiment, when the iterations was 1500, the prediction accuracy of GRA-Entropy-CNN was 93%. This was 2% and 8% higher than TOPSIS-Entropy-CNN and FCE-Entropy-CNN, respectively. The accuracy of GRA-Entropy-SOM-CNN was 92%, which was 12% higher than that of GRA-CRITIC-SOM-CNN. This shows that the combination of entropy method and grey correlation method with CNN can improve the prediction accuracy. The empirical analysis results show that the development of innovation will be positively affected by the transformation of digital technology, and its regression coefficient is 0.556, and the significance level is 0.001; the innovation development will be positively affected by the knowledge innovation ability, and its regression coefficient is 0.188, and the significance level is 0.001. The above results demonstrate that the combination of convolutional neural networks and entropy method can effectively improve the accuracy of financial risk prediction, and also prove that digital technology transformation can promote innovative development of enterprises, providing a theoretical basis for the formulation of strategies for enterprises in digital transformation.},

  abstract = {Objective
            
              Breast cancer stands as one of the most prevalent cancers globally, representing around 31% of new cancer diagnoses in women. The emergence of drug resistance undermines the efficacy of chemotherapy, highlighting the urgent need for alternative treatments. Ginger (
              Zingiber officinale
              ) is a dietary plant known for its different biological effects. Our goal was to isolate the cytotoxic compounds from the petroleum ether extract of dried ginger.
            
          
          
            Methods
            Through bioactivity-guided isolation and comprehensive phytochemical analyses, the cytotoxic effects of different concentrations (ranging from 3.91 to 500 µg/mL) of ginger petroleum ether extract and its fractions were examined against MCF-7, SW 480, and A549 cancer cell lines, as well as 3T3 normal cells using the MTT assay. Fractions were obtained using column chromatography, and those showing significant toxicity were further fractionated using a bioactivity-guided separation method. The most cytotoxic component was purified using plate chromatography, and its toxicity was evaluated. Additionally, molecular docking was performed on gamma-secretase, PPARγ, MMP-9, tubulin, proteins Notch1, HES1, and cyclin D1.
          
          
            Results
            
              Fractions showed toxicity against all the tested cell lines, with a greater effect on MCF-7. A subfraction, FsA7, exhibited an impressive IC
              50
              value of 1.68 ± 0.36 µg/mL against MCF-7. It also showed selective toxicity towards cancer cells compared to 3T3 cells. Upon analysis using GC/MS, it was identified as 6-shogaol based on the retention index (RI) and library search programs. Molecular docking studies indicated that 6-shogaol interacts with critical cancer-related targets, especially MMP-9, shedding light on its mechanism of action.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 6-shogaol as a complementary treatment in breast cancer. This research provides foundational insights into the use of ginger-derived compounds in enhancing current cancer treatment strategies. Pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of cytotoxic effects of 6-shogaol in combination with anti-cancer drugs can be considered for future studies.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of vocational education informatization, how to accurately evaluate curriculum quality and learning effect has become an important topic in the field of education. This paper proposes an intelligent evaluation model based on the combination of Diffusion reinforcement learning and multi-scale residual network, aiming at improving the evaluation accuracy and intelligence level of vocational education courses. The model is designed to scale efficiently for large datasets and diverse educational platforms, ensuring its applicability across different regions with varying curricula and student engagement. By designing a comprehensive model, this model can monitor the learning process in real time, analyze students’ learning behaviors, and ensure the security of data based on network security requirements. Based on the Diffusion reinforcement learning method, this paper uses the state, action, and reward mechanism in the reinforcement learning framework to dynamically evaluate the course content. The training process of reinforcement learning obtains real-time feedback through interaction with students, forming an accurate curriculum evaluation model. Experimental data show that the model based on Diffusion reinforcement learning improves the accuracy of course evaluation by about 15%, and the evaluation error of the model is reduced by 20% compared with traditional evaluation methods. Combined with multi-scale residual network, the curriculum data is deeply analyzed, and the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation system are enhanced by multi-level feature extraction. The introduction of MSRN enables the model to extract features at different scales, further improving the depth and accuracy of understanding of course content. The experimental verification shows that the evaluation accuracy of the model after using MSRN is improved by 18%, and it performs well in the adaptability of different course contents, especially in complex data sets. Considering the network security, this paper specially designs the data transmission and storage mode based on encryption technology to ensure the privacy and security of students’ data. By adopting SSL encryption protocol and firewall technology, the system can effectively resist external attacks and ensure the integrity of evaluation data. Experiments show that under the premise of network security, the evaluation results of the model are not affected by malicious attacks, and the stability of the model is improved by 25%. The intelligent evaluation model proposed in this research has significant advantages in improving the accuracy and robustness of vocational education curriculum evaluation, especially in the context of complex data and network security, and shows a good practical application prospect.},

  abstract = {Effective proportional–integral–derivative controller tuning is critical for attaining high-performance operation in direct current motor systems, especially when traditional approaches fail under nonlinear or uncertain dynamics. This study conducted a statistically robust comparative analysis of seven evolutionary algorithms for proportional–integral–derivative gain tuning: genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, firefly algorithm, artificial bee colony, simulated annealing and invasive weed optimisation algorithm. Simulations were performed in MATLAB/Simulink using two different tuning scenarios: Case 1 (conservative bounds) and Case 2 (aggressive bounds), with the integral time absolute error serving as the primary performance metric. Analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's
            d
            were employed to ensure statistical validity. The results revealed distinct trade-offs among the algorithms. Particle swarm optimisation achieved the best overall performance, with a minimal integral time absolute error mean of 190.54 in Case 2, low volatility and a moderate execution time of 1200.19 s. The invasive weed optimisation algorithm was the fastest algorithm, with execution times of 285.76 and 371.43 s in Cases 1 and 2, respectively, but it exhibited higher integral time absolute error variability. Simulated annealing and the firefly algorithm yielded the lowest integral time absolute error means (158.74 and 160.22, respectively) in Case 1, but they required the highest computational time (up to 20,567.84 s for simulated annealing). In contrast, the artificial bee colony performed the worst, with a Case 2 integral time absolute error mean of 422.38 and significant gain inconsistency. Statistical analysis with analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's
            d
            revealed the significance of the differences. This work provides evidence-based guidance for selecting evolutionary algorithms in proportional–integral–derivative tuning based on system priorities. A hybrid invasive weed optimisation algorithm–particle swarm optimisation framework is proposed as a promising future direction, combining the rapid global search of invasive weed optimisation algorithm with the reliable convergence of particle swarm optimisation for real-time, high-precision control.},

  abstract = {Background:
            CT signs of inflammatory and malignant pulmonary nodules are shared and often confused, leading to difficulties in clinical differentiation. Previous relevant studies have neglected to explore the reclassification of morphological signs. This study was designed to evaluate radiomics based on CT images for distinguishing difficult-to-diagnose inflammatory and malignant pulmonary nodules.
          
          
            Methods:
            This retrospective study included 333 patients with malignant pulmonary nodules (Mn) and 161 patients with inflammatory pulmonary nodules (In) who were pathologically diagnosed between January 2017 and February 2024. According to whether the CT signs of pulmonary nodules were typical (typical: A or atypical: B), they were further divided into typical malignant nodules (MnA), atypical malignant nodules (MnB), typical inflammatory nodules (InA) and atypical inflammatory nodules (InB). Group 1 (MnA/InA), group 2 (InA/MnB), group 3 (MnA/InB), and group 4 (MnB/InB) were obtained by pairwise comparison. Clinical models, radiomics models and nomogram models were established for each group. The model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The AUCs of the models were compared by using the DeLong test.
          
          
            Results:
            In the test set, the AUC values ranged from 0.63 to 0.82. In each group, the nomogram model had the highest diagnostic efficiency and had high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. For group 3, the nomogram model had the best diagnostic ability (training set: AUC, 0.83; 95% CI [0.75-0.90]; accuracy, 0.72; sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.84, test set: AUC, 0.82; 95% CI [0.70-0.94]; accuracy, 0.65; sensitivity, 0.96).
          
          
            Conclusions:
            The nomogram model was useful in diagnosing inflammatory and malignant nodules with typical or atypical signs, especially those with malignant signs, yielding a better classification performance than the radiomics and clinical model.},

To address this, the complex and irregular surface geometry of biofouling was simplified by decomposing it into a series of single-wave models. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) were conducted to simulate turbulent channel flow over wavy walls, generating a comprehensive dataset of frictional resistance components. The frictional force acting on the wavy surface was defined as the effective shear stress, accounting for both viscous shear and pressure-induced forces. The distribution of friction velocity exhibited a strong correlation with the pressure component acting on the surface.

  abstract = {Modeling the complex interrelationships among students, learning resources, and knowledge points remains a significant challenge in intelligent educational systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an improved Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN) framework for comprehensive learning behavior modeling and personalized educational recommendation. We define three distinct node types—students, resources, and knowledge points—and construct a multi-relational heterogeneous graph by incorporating diverse edge types derived from behavioral interactions (e.g., clicks, completions), knowledge dependencies (prerequisite relationships), and content associations (label-based matching). A student–resource–knowledge point meta-path is designed to capture composite relational patterns, and a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) is employed to aggregate neighborhood information while preserving semantic distinctions across relation types. To model temporal learning sequences, a Transformer encoder is integrated to generate dynamic attention weights that reflect evolving student engagement. A gated fusion mechanism is introduced to effectively combine dynamic sequential features with static structural representations, ensuring feature complementarity and minimizing interference. The model further incorporates two jointly optimized output branches—learning status prediction (including dropout risk and performance forecasting) and personalized resource recommendation—through shared parameter learning. Experimental results on real-world educational datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach: the F1-score for dropout risk prediction reaches 0.91, grade prediction achieves a stable RMSE of approximately 0.32, and resource recommendation attains an NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) @10 of 0.93 in standard scenarios and 0.88 in knowledge gap scenarios. Moreover, the coverage of long-tail resources improves to 0.56, with a reduced recommendation bias coefficient of 0.29. The results validate the model’s effectiveness in capturing intricate student–resource–knowledge dynamics, offering a robust solution for learning analytics and adaptive educational systems.},

The Dual Quaternion Linear Blending (DLB) algorithm is employed to enhance the realism of the model’s motion. The improved median-mean filtering algorithm and the improved Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm are utilized to detect and recognize human motion. These techniques are integrated into a martial arts learning assistance system. The results showed that compared with the standard median-mean filtering algorithm, the improved median-mean filtering algorithm had better filtering effect and more sensitive processing nodes in both martial arts motion forms. Its stability rate and real-time rate were 95.53% and 97.05%, respectively, with an improvement of 8.49% and 26.54%, indicating that the improved algorithm has better performance. In comparison to the standard EWMA algorithm, the enhanced EWMA algorithm demonstrated favorable performance in both scenarios involving angle alteration. This resulted in a reduction in computational error and delay, as well as an improvement in both the smoothing rate and real-time rate, with an increase of 53.02% and 70.42%, respectively. In the two-player mode, the CPU resource usage was reduced by 34.5% and the GPU resource usage was increased by 29.5% by updating the vertices and rendering through GPU.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Shenzhen’s economy, there is an urgent need for a large number of urban core industrial parks that meet modern needs. However, many core industrial parks have low utilization rates due to the aging facilities and irrational functional layout. Therefore, to enhance the utilization rate of industrial parks, the study proposes a design quality research method for urban renewal projects of Shenzhen industrial park that integrates building information modeling and virtual reality technology. The study integrates the data in building information modeling into an update project engineering schedule by introducing an improved genetic algorithm, and constructs an evaluation quality index for industrial park update project design to improve the overall design quality. The experimental results revealed that the genetic ant colony algorithm reduced the number of iterations by 36% and 25%, the iteration time by 25.6% and the accuracy by 97.4% compared to the genetic algorithm and the ant colony algorithm. The improved genetic ant colony algorithm optimized the building information modeling data by 16%, and the load indexes decreased by 0.096 and 0.184 relative to the other two algorithms. The project has a quality management score of 88.97, with an overall rating of excellent. As a result, the proposed model is able to generate the updated project schedule and enhance the efficiency of project management, which can help to promote the upgrading of the industrial parks in Shenzhen and the sustainable development of the city. The suggested strategy can create a timetable for renewal projects and increase project management effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Due to its specific audience, traditional preschool art courses are relatively limited. To enhance preschool teachers’ art teaching abilities, this paper proposes combining virtual reality technology and digital media art. Utilizing computers and modern network technology, users’ information is collected in 12 different teaching environments under the backdrop of digital media virtual technology. The score of the user’s information receiving effect is obtained by the ratio of the number of scenes in the user’s subjective memory to the total number of scenes. SMOTE data enhancement algorithm and Few-shot learning algorithm are used to process the received information to get the user’s receiving effect. The score range of the user’s information receiving effect is 0–1, the larger the number, the better the information receiving effect. The significance of this research lies in its demonstration of how integrating offline laboratory hardware with online virtual reality technology to create an immersive teaching environment can significantly enhance students’ learning interest. By effectively combining physical and virtual resources, this innovative approach highlights the potential for advanced technologies to foster greater engagement and improve educational outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of developing hybrid teaching methods to maximize student motivation and participation, paving the way for more effective and interactive learning experiences.},

To study and propose a new digital landscape design method that optimizes park path system design by combining spatial theory and landscape elements. The new method uses a convex space model to construct a model of the park path system, treating specific roads as convex spaces and the grasslands, fences, and shrubs on both sides of the roads as convex space boundaries. Using a two-step spontaneous geolocation data platform to visualize park path system data. Visualize the path system of the park landscape using digital technology. Introduce five characteristic elements of park landscape space and determine the relationship between the main landscape elements and spatial theory. Analyze the qualitative relationship between these elements and spontaneous geolocation data through linear regression analysis and correlation testing, and conduct simulation experiments. In the simulation experiment, the corresponding selectivity of the flower show area was 0.97 at a distance of 40 m. The path selectivity corresponding to the parent-child area was second only to the flower show area, with a specific value of 0.89. The path selectivity for these three areas of bamboo pavilion, badminton, and basketball was not significantly different, all located around 0.75. As the distance increased, the selectivity value gradually decreased, and the changing magnitude gradually decreased. This research method has significant effectiveness and feasibility in the important design parameters of parks. This can provide certain reference value for landscape architecture design.},

  abstract = {This study aims to develop machine learning (ML)-based homogenization models to efficiently predict the effective elastoplastic properties of short fiber-reinforced composites (SFRCs), reducing the reliance on computationally expensive micromechanical simulations. Sobol sampling is employed to generate training data by varying constitutive and microstructural parameters of representative volume element. Several ML models including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) are trained to predict homogenized stress-strain responses. A new approach is introduced that decomposes the stress-strain response into elastic and plastic components, allowing the ML models to learn these components separately and effectively. Additionally, the Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) is employed to minimize simulation runs and evaluate parameter sensitivity through ANOVA. The best-performing ML model is implemented in a finite element analysis (FEA) of an automotive component. Among all models, ANN demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting the macroscopic elastoplastic response across a wide range of input parameters. Finally, the ANN-based elastoplastic material model is validated on a real-world macroscopic structure by implementing it into the finite element analysis of an automotive component. The results demonstrate that ML-based homogenization closely matches the traditional homogenization methods and also highlights its ability to effectively capture nonlinear material behavior.},

However, the complicated information retrieval content presented by the Internet search engine has increased the difficulty of travel information search. To improve the targeting and accuracy of tourism information search behavior, data mining methods are used for analysis. Based on the characteristics of tourism text data, an improved clustering algorithm is introduced to classify the data, and a search method based on dynamic themes and search intentions is proposed. The results showed that the algorithm proposed in the study had good convergence and stability. The sum of squared errors curve results indicated that its error results in the three dimensions of traffic, catering, and accommodation were relatively small. The normalized discounted cumulative gain value of tourist attraction information search showed that the algorithm proposed in the study was significantly better than other comparative algorithms. Its maximum value approached 0.80 when the theme dimension was 5, and its accuracy in classifying information under both target search intention and analytical search intention exceeded 80%. The maximum time spent did not exceed 3 s. The main contribution of this study is to propose an innovative tourism information search method, which not only optimizes the processing and analysis process of tourism data, but also provides scientific basis for the improvement of tourism data recommendation systems.

  abstract = {This study investigates the driving effects of Intelligent MICE tourism on regional economic development, with Guizhou Province as the research focus. Using tourism economic data from 2009 to 2019, combined with geographic information analysis and an input-output model, we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of Guizhou’s tourism industry and its impact on regional economic growth. The results indicate that after 2016, Guizhou’s total tourism revenue and visitor numbers entered a phase of rapid expansion, with annual growth rates averaging 36.96% and 32.15%, respectively. Spatial analysis reveals that tourism revenue distribution across county-level administrative divisions follows a diffusion pattern, expanding from core cities such as Guiyang and Zunyi to surrounding areas. Furthermore, an analysis of industrial structure indicates that Guizhou’s economy is primarily driven by the secondary and tertiary sectors, with the tourism industry’s backward linkages within the industrial chain strengthening over time, positioning it as a key catalyst for growth in related industries. Model validation results demonstrate that both the influence and sensitivity coefficients of the tourism industry significantly exceed the national economic average, underscoring its substantial stimulative effect on regional economic expansion. Geographic detector analysis further reveals that policy regulation, advancements in information technology, and regional industrial structures play a critical role in the coupled and coordinated development of the tourism economy and the broader regional economy. Based on these findings, this study proposes policy recommendations to optimize Guizhou’s tourism industry structure, enhance tourism service infrastructure, and promote integrated regional development. By integrating spatiotemporal pattern analysis with industrial chain effect evaluation, this study highlights tourism’s core role in regional economic development and quantitatively assesses its contribution from a geographical perspective.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Location-Based Services (LBSs), research on Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) has gained extensive attention. Although existing channel state information (CSI)-based positioning algorithms have achieved good positioning accuracy, they still face significant challenges in practical applications due to their high computational complexity and cost. To address this, this paper proposes an indoor positioning method based on the frequency fading characteristics of broadband signals, named the ACCS algorithm. This method introduces the innovative use of the autocorrelation spectrum of broadband signals to transform the indoor positioning problem into an image classification task. After that, to achieve lightweight model design, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which is an unsupervised learning model based on convolutional neural networks, is employed to reduce the dimension and compress the input images. Finally, a deep residual network combined with a CS-Attention module, which is composed of a channel feature extraction module and a spatial feature extraction module, is used to efficiently capture image features for more accurate position estimation. The performance of the proposed method was tested using data collected in a conference room. Experimental results show that the autocorrelation processing and attention module in the proposed algorithm significantly improve positioning accuracy, achieving a positioning error of 0.245 m in complex indoor environments. Additionally, comparisons with common positioning algorithms (AOA, W-KNN) demonstrate that our method exhibits significant advantages in positioning accuracy and robustness.},

In response, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)—a US-based network of social scientists, technologists, and activists—was formed to develop an environmental data justice framework to address the ongoing political forces that influence how environmental data is collected, shared, and rendered flawed, incomplete, or vulnerable. By collaborating with communities and non-profit organizations, EDGI's Environmental Enforcement Watch (EEW) project designed computational notebooks that critically situate, question, and analyze EPA datasets on industry compliance and state enforcement of environmental regulations beyond the Trump political moment. These civic partnerships expose gaps, biases, and silences in environmental data that sustain a harmful permission-to-pollute system. Using a multi-sited auto-technography, we reflect on the development and use of EEW notebooks, tracing their application across workshops, collectively designed reports, and data stewardship practices.

Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts form protective films primarily through coordination bonding and electrostatic adsorption, with structural optimization significantly enhancing their performance. Composite inhibitor formulations demonstrate superior efficacy in field applications. However, current studies exhibit critical gaps, including validated failure models under multi-field coupling conditions and high-temperature adsorption kinetics data. Future research should prioritize molecular design optimization, enhanced environmental compatibility, and advanced multi-scale simulations. Integrating in-situ characterization techniques with machine learning approaches will enable mechanism-driven, precision design of high-temperature corrosion inhibitors, thereby offering robust theoretical frameworks and practical engineering solutions for long-term corrosion mitigation in extreme environments.},

The test results show that increasing the styrene-acrylic mortar content and reducing the water-cement ratio can significantly improve the crack resistance of the styrene-acrylic mortar, manifested as an increase in flexural strength, a decrease in the compressive-flexural ratio, and an improvement in toughness and bonding strength. However, there was no significant improvement in compressive strength. It was confirmed that the styrene-acrylic mortar with 15% styrene-acrylic mortar content and a water-cement ratio of 30% exhibited optimal mechanical and crack resistance properties and is suitable for repairing cracks in the concrete face of the aqueduct. Additionally, higher curing humidity and temperature significantly improved the dry cracking resistance of the styrene-acrylic mortar.

  abstract = {This study fabricated ancient brick column specimens with two different mortar joint spalling depths based on the common material deterioration mode of ancient masonry. Specifically, modified composite sticky rice-lime mortar and natural hemp fiber rope were used as the raw materials, and horizontal mortar joint grouting and fiber rope reinforcement methods were adopted to prepare performance-enhanced ancient brick column specimens with six different strengthening conditions. Through uniaxial compression tests, the compression failure morphology and mechanical properties of the specimens under different strengthening conditions were studied, and the variation patterns of mechanical performance indicators with the strengthening conditions were analyzed. The calculation formula for the compressive strength of performance-enhanced ancient masonry was proposed, and the full stress-strain relationship model under compression and the crack length development model were established. The results show that the non-strengthened brick columns exhibit brittle failure morphology under compression, and the compressive strength and deformation modulus decrease with the increasing mortar joint spalling depth. The crack development process of reinforced brick columns under compression presents ductile characteristics. The compressive strength and crack density increase with an increasing grouting depth and mortar joint grouting-fiber rope reinforcement significantly enhances the elastoplastic deformation capacity of brick columns under compression. Under the 25% grouting depth ratio, the characteristic stress and corresponding deformation modulus of the stress-strain curve increase first and then decrease with the increasing fiber rope reinforcement ratio. The compressive strength and crack density of ancient brick column with the 12.5% grouting depth ratio and 0.25% reinforcement ratio increase by 57.1%, 24.7%, respectively. The established formula and models can clearly describe the evolution of mechanical properties of ancient masonry, offering good engineering applicability.},

  abstract = {The droplet contact liquid cooling method can effectively control the battery temperature and temperature difference. However, the cooling performance may be affected by dynamic conditions such as acceleration and road slope. Taking the 18650 lithium-ion battery as the research object, the study focuses on designing a drop contact liquid cooling system targeting power batteries. Additionally, an in-depth study is conducted on the impact of vehicle driving conditions on the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system. Research results indicate that as the drop position offset increases, the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system gradually decreases. Specifically, when the coolant flow rate is 10 mL/min and the offset reaches 9 mm, the maximum temperature difference of the battery module increases to 3.7°C. Meanwhile, as the slope increases, the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system gradually decreases. When the slope reaches 20% and the coolant flow rate is 20 mL/min, the maximum temperature difference of the battery module is 4.8°C.},

In order to make the security maintenance process of the English teaching system more intelligent and convenient, the research innovatively uses Struts + Spring + Hibernate framework to build a maintenance model that can be operated in real time and handle alarms on the monitoring, alarms, configuration, and other issues involved in the system, and applies it to the optimisation process of the teaching system. In the test results, when the maintenance cases reached 200, the maintenance failures for each functional module in the system were below 60, and the successful maintenance was between 150 and 190. The maintenance success rate of each module for transactions was about 92%. When testing the security monitoring function of the system, with 500 concurrent users, the transactions executed per second and the clicks per second of each monitoring module reached consistency. This proved that no response failure occurred, with a response rate of 100%. Therefore, the proposed new maintenance model improves the security performance of this English teaching system’s service quality. This system makes the security monitoring process simpler and more effective, which is conducive to promoting the further application and development of teaching systems.},

  abstract = {As one of the world’s three major ecosystems, wetlands play an important role in maintaining ecological balance. However, in recent years, wetland resources have suffered from encroachment and frequent water environment and soil pollution problems, causing serious damage to China’s wetland ecosystem. The study proposes to conduct a performance audit (PA) of the wetland park project (WPP) using financial and accounting tools to assess the effectiveness of wetland restoration. The study first constructed a PA evaluation index system for WPP using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model to ensure the comprehensiveness of the evaluation indexes. Subsequently, grey relational analysis combined with analytic hierarchy process (GREY-AHP) was introduced to convert the scores into mutual inverse judgment matrices and assign weights to the indicators to improve the accuracy and scientificity of the construction system. Finally, the PA evaluation results are derived through comprehensive evaluation. The innovation of the study is to apply the PSR model to WPP’s PA, which significantly improves the accuracy and comprehensive performance of the evaluation compared with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the maximum F1 values of the research-proposed model on the test set and validation set are 95.2 and 97.6, respectively, which are higher than those of other algorithms, showing the advantage in comprehensive evaluation performance. The results of the study are of great significance for improving the performance level of WPP and effectively protecting and restoring wetlands.},

This study aims to construct a personalized recommendation system based on Transformer and YOLO image recognition models to improve the recognition and recommendation effect of traditional village landscapes. In terms of background, as a cultural heritage, the unique landscape of traditional villages attracts many tourists, but the existing recommendation system often lacks personalization and accuracy. Firstly, the YOLO model is used to quickly and accurately identify traditional village images and extract key landscape features. Then, combined with the powerful sequence processing capabilities of the Transformer model, the user behavior data is deeply mined to build a personalized recommendation algorithm. Experimental results show that image recognition accuracy of the proposed system reaches 95.6%, which is 8.2% higher than that of the traditional method. Regarding recommendation satisfaction, user satisfaction was as high as 90.3%, which was significantly higher than 78.5% of control group. In addition, system response time is shortened to 1.2 s, effectively improving the user experience.

  abstract = {In the rapid development of higher education management, informatization has become an indispensable driving force. With the popularity of the campus card and the accumulation of various business system data, the campus big data environment has initially taken shape. However, there are many shortcomings in the current student information management platform, especially in the accuracy of data mining. To meet this challenge, we use a decision tree, naive Bayes algorithm, and regression analysis to construct a comprehensive analysis model. On this basis, we use Hadoop technology to build a set of behavior analysis and intelligent management system frameworks for higher vocational college students. The system can comprehensively collect and organize students’ study, life and consumption data, and accurately present the overall situation of students on campus. Through in-depth correlation analysis, we can reveal the inner relationship between students’ learning results, life patterns, and psychological changes. To verify the effectiveness of the system, we conducted extensive testing. In the comparison of prediction accuracy of combination algorithms, we used the average relative error as an evaluation index to analyze and predict the behavior of vocational college students. The test data covers a sample of students ranging from 1000 to 6000. The results show that compared with traditional single algorithms, the student behavior prediction model proposed in this study based on multiple algorithm combinations exhibits higher prediction accuracy, with an average relative error of less than 5%. This result indicates that the hybrid algorithm model we constructed has superior predictive performance.},

This study presents a unified framework that integrates adaptive deep neural network compression with priority-aware task scheduling, specifically tailored for edge computing environments. A hierarchical joint compression strategy is proposed, combining sparsity and quantization through learnable parameters to achieve substantial model size reduction while preserving predictive accuracy. Concurrently, a two-stage load redistribution scheduling algorithm is developed, guided by task latency tolerance and completion time deviation, to enhance resource utilization and achieve balanced server load distribution. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark deep learning models and real-world power IoT scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method attains a 143× compression ratio with only a 1.3% loss in accuracy. Furthermore, it improves task latency and load balancing efficiency by over 18% and 21%, respectively, when compared to conventional methods.

Using nuclear power to generate electricity can not only alleviate the problem of energy tension, but also solve the problem of pollution faced by other energy sources. Therefore, nuclear power has become one of the major energy sources vigorously developed by countries around the world. With the development of the nuclear power industry, the nuclear industry has begun to research and develop various types of new reactors with a view to the future in order to further improve the safety and economy of nuclear power. In recent years, small modular reactors have gained wide attention due to their low initial cost, short construction period, flexible power plant layout, and wide use. At the same time, the small modular reactor of nuclear power plant also has great disadvantages, that is, the effectiveness of the safety system of the small modular reactor of nuclear power plant is difficult to be guaranteed under complex conditions, especially in the problem elimination after the accident, which has been the focus and difficulty of nuclear energy research in all countries. Therefore, taking the Westinghouse small modular reactor designed by Westinghouse as an example, this paper studies the actual elimination effects and measures for serious accidents of small modular reactors in nuclear power plants, and then verifies the safety of small modular reactors. After research, after a serious accident occurred in a small modular reactor, timely elimination of the residual heat of the small modular reactor is the key and difficult work to eliminate the small modular reactor; the passive core makeup tank designed in the small modular reactor has a rapid and excellent mitigation effect after a serious accident.},

Statistical methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman grade correlation coefficient and regression analysis were adopted to deeply analyze the relationship between students’ use frequency of digital narrative tools, self-assessment of foreign language digital narrative ability and learning motivation. The results show that the use frequency of interactive learning tools and collaborative platforms has a significant positive correlation with students’ speaking and writing ability. Students’ learning motivation also showed a positive correlation with their frequency of using digital tools and their foreign language learning effectiveness. Based on these findings, this study suggests that educators should more widely integrate digital narrative tools into foreign language teaching in non-common languages, and design teaching strategies that stimulate students’ intrinsic learning motivation. This study not only provides empirical research support for the foreign language education of non-common language students but also puts forward useful strategies and suggestions on how to effectively use digital tools to promote students’ foreign language learning. Future research can further explore other influencing factors to provide more comprehensive teaching guidance.},

  abstract = {Table tennis is a highly technical and fast sport, which requires athletes to have good technical level and physical fitness. In order to achieve more efficient and intelligent table tennis assisted training, a knowledge-based general sports-assisted training framework (KGSTF) was introduced, and the functions of each module were analyzed. At the same time, an adaptive contact judgment threshold generation algorithm was proposed for the implementation of this framework in specific table tennis training. On this basis, a pose correction method based on contact position constraints and an optical motion capture data preprocessing method were designed, and an automated program was developed to handle data stitching, clutter removal, and labeling. The results showed that in the validation experiment based on the adaptive contact judgment threshold generation algorithm, by incorporating the optimization results of the previous frame into the objective function, the optimized actions can be made smoother. Meanwhile, the landing error of the advanced subjects was only 1.539 cm when receiving a slight topspin serve, 0.947 cm when receiving a downspin serve, and 5.294 cm when receiving a strong topspin serve, which illustrates that a smaller serve speed has more stability. In addition, the return success rate of advanced subjects in the slight topspin mode was the best, with a maximum value of 95.12% and an average of 91.38%. The average return success rate of intermediate subjects in the slight topspin mode was as high as 75.36%. Compared with the strong topspin and downspin service modes, the return success rate was increased by 13.72% and 26.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, the return success rate of advanced subjects was significantly higher than that of other subjects. The results show that the sports auxiliary framework designed by this study can be effectively applied to the sports evaluation of table tennis auxiliary training, which is helpful to provide personalized training guidance and improvement suggestions for table tennis players, and promotes the scientific and professional development of table tennis.},

In this study, we propose a novel chlorophyll content estimation model based on an improved whale optimization algorithm (IMWOA). The IMWOA integrates three key innovations—a nonlinear control factor adjustment for balanced exploration and exploitation, an adaptive weight mechanism to regulate search dynamics, and a differential evolution strategy to enhance population diversity. These enhancements collectively improve the global search capability and convergence precision of the original WOA. The selected color indices from RGB, HSI, and L*a*b* (CIELAB) spaces, filtered via entropy weighting and stepwise regression, were used as inputs to a support vector regression (SVR) model optimized by the IMWOA. The experimental results indicate that the IMWOA can achieve the most accurate estimation, with an R

  abstract = {Aiming at services such as nearby consumption and flexible interaction of new loads, it is necessary to achieve higher precision clock synchronization of local equipment, and the public network transmission delay fluctuates randomly, which cannot meet the corresponding accuracy requirements. In order to get rid of the limitations brought by public network transmission, distributed clock synchronization replaces the centralized timing of the master station through information exchange between nodes to achieve higher precision clock synchronization. However, in the process of distributed synchronization, a large amount of information will be exchanged between key nodes of the link and their neighbors, but the concurrent transmission capacity of key nodes such as dedicated power gateways and centralized coordinators (CCOs) is limited, which is difficult to meet the corresponding communication requirements. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a time-triggered distributed synchronization scheme based on node priority, which can meet the requirements of high-precision synchronization and reduce the transmission burden of link aggregation nodes such as power dedicated gateways and CCOs.},

  abstract = {At present, various new technologies are applied to the reform of college English courses. Cases are also increasing. Big data technology has become the focus of most industries in the era of social media with data explosion. Its powerful data analysis and prediction capabilities provide convenience for its application. Applying big data technology to the difficulties encountered in curriculum reform will be able to efficiently and accurately solve related problems. The rapid coverage of IoT applications such as the Internet of Vehicles, smart homes, and smart cities has provided precedents for the use of IoT technology in various industries. With the rapid development of the needs of the Metaverse, it has become a trend to apply IoT technology to social and educational fields. Internet of Things technology can use various miniature portable devices to link into a body area network. The network can record the status of students when they learn English, which supports the subsequent analysis of students’ learning needs and learning effects. The analysis results can also provide more convenience for college English teachers to prepare lessons and teach. In order to investigate the current predicament of college English curriculum reform, this paper distributed 900 questionnaires to managers, teachers, and students in 20 colleges and universities, mainly through the questionnaire star online platform and offline campus distribution. Using classification and statistical algorithms to process and analyze the data, it is found that the problems existing in the current college English curriculum reform include the poor English ability of students, the heavy teaching burden of English teachers, and the lack of an effective comprehensive processing platform for English teaching information. Then, combined with big data and Internet of Things technology, we designed solutions for teachers and students’ dilemma in curriculum reform from the perspectives of platform establishment, intelligent interconnection, and data analysis.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the problem of Chinese pronunciation errors made by native Uyghur speakers by proposing a phoneme confusion modeling framework that integrates cross-linguistic phonological comparison and data-driven methods. Based on speech transfer theory, a corpus of 52,510 standard and non-standard pronunciations (total duration 167.2 hours) was constructed. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm was employed to align phoneme sequences, and Apriori association rule mining was used to uncover high-frequency confusion patterns. The study found that differences in sound, like the lack of retroflex consonants and the simplification of compound vowels, caused systematic errors. For example, the high-frequency substitution of affricates “ch→q” (62.5%) and compound vowels “uo→o/u” (76.1%). Data-driven methods further validated the phonological hypotheses and identified context-dependent phenomena (such as “ian→an” medial weakening). The confusion rule base achieved a robustness of F1-score 0.87. The quantitative model based on the confusion matrix can be integrated into intelligent speech assessment systems to provide real-time corrective feedback (e.g., “‘uo’ detected as misread as ‘o’, probability 76.1%”). This study provides an interpretable rule base and dynamic alignment technical foundation for cross-language pronunciation error correction algorithms, which has theoretical and practical significance for optimizing computer-assisted language teaching systems.},

Currently, more development opportunities have been provided for the traditional human resource management system.

The model uses the improved long short-term memory neural network to process and classify the information of human resource management, and realizes the processing of human resource management information. The minimum root-mean-square error of the newly constructed algorithm model is 0.18, which is 0.15 smaller than that of the convolutional neural network and 0.06 smaller than that of the genetic neural network. The fitness of the new model is 6.2% higher than that of the convolutional neural network and 2.8% higher than that of the genetic algorithm. The whole model is superior to the traditional neural network algorithm in fit and accuracy, which can solve the problem of human resource management information processing under SSH framework.

However, few studies have explored the mechanism of college students’ learning engagement in blended learning from the perspective of fostering positive academic emotions. Based on a questionnaire survey of 375 college students in a blended learning environment, the data were analyzed and processed using SPSS24.0 and AMOS27.0 software. Structural equation modeling was established to explore the mediating effect of academic self-efficacy in moderating the relationship between academic engagement and positive academic mood. The findings suggest that: (1) in the blended learning environment, college students demonstrate more favorable academic performance and moderate learning engagement. (2) There is a significant positive correlation between active hyperarousal and active hypo-arousal with learning engagement. (3) Positive hyperarousal and positive hypo-arousal not only directly enhance learning engagement but also indirectly promote academic self-efficacy. In teaching practice, under a blended learning environment, educators should further improve the quality of students’ blended learning input. They need to help students foster positive academic emotions of enjoyment and pride and promote their self-efficacy at the same time. Furthermore, they should explore various teaching methods to improve students’ enthusiasm for learning and concentration.},

Through detailed data analysis, we found that the construction of smart campuses has achieved remarkable results in improving management efficiency. In comparison to the traditional student management model, smart campus leverages advanced data analysis technology to achieve precise tracking and evaluation of student behavior, learning status, and other pertinent information. This technological advancement has led to a noteworthy enhancement in management efficiency, with an approximate 30% increase. Furthermore, smart campus facilitates student management departments in promptly identifying and resolving issues faced by students through in-depth data analysis, ultimately leading to a significant improvement in student satisfaction. In terms of educational innovation, smart campus uses big data analysis to accurately locate students’ learning needs and points of interest, providing strong support for personalized teaching. According to statistics, in classes that adopt the smart campus teaching model, the average score of students has increased by 15%, and the degree of learning participation has also increased significantly. In addition, this study also focuses on data security and privacy protection issues in the construction of smart campuses, and proposes corresponding solutions. The construction and application of smart campuses that integrate student management and educational innovation not only improves management efficiency, but also promotes the innovation and development of education and teaching. In the future, we will continue to deepen research and promote the continuous optimization and upgrading of smart campus construction.

  abstract = {V2G technology enables bidirectional energy transfer from EVs to the grid. It is possible to use the grid to charge EVs and to use EVs to charge the grid during peak grid hours, thus alleviating the problem of grid load fluctuations and improving grid efficiency. Many traditional authentication protocols have been proposed to protect V2G. However, the rapid development of high-speed Internet and the race to organize the development of quantum computers are a great threat to the existing authentication schemes. Therefore, traditional authentication protocols are vulnerable to attacks in the era of quantum computing. In this paper, I propose an extended chaotic mapping-based authentication and quantum key distribution scheme to defend against quantum attacks and prevent known traditional security attacks. The proposed extended chaotic mapping-based authentication protocol is secure under the real or random (ROR) model. Also, experimental results demonstrate that our protocol is lightweight compared to existing authentication protocols, as listed in the performance analysis section. The comparative analysis shows that the protocol is suitable for practical implementation in a quantum environment.},

  abstract = {In modern digital grid systems, ensuring the stability of power operations and the accuracy of energy metering is critically dependent on effective asset identification, reconfiguration, and automated maintenance strategies. Conventional grid monitoring mechanisms like manual inspections and fixed-sensor networks also experience many difficulties, such as high costs in operation, scalability problems, and inability to present real-time, all-around information. To address these challenges, this research introduces an advanced methodology that leverages deep learning models for asset identification and automation in digital grid systems. Specifically, the research utilizes Roach Infestation Optimized Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (RI-Att-BiLSTM) networks for intelligent asset identification and topology recognition in low-voltage distribution network substations. Time-series data is collected from smart meters and sensors distributed across the low-voltage distribution network. These sensors continuously capture data on electricity consumption from substations and connected consumers. The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, outliers, and gaps, followed by normalization to scale the data for effective modeling. The RI-Att-BiLSTM-based technique reduces the dimensionality of the electricity consumption data matrix, transforming the complex topology identification task into a solvable convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, the proposed model achieve a superior balance between accuracy (98.43%) and higher recall, precision, and F1-score. The enhanced grid resilience provided by this methodology facilitates precise asset identification, real-time monitoring, and fault-tolerant operations, thereby contributing to more efficient and reliable digital grid systems.},

Emerging evidence suggests dopamine receptors influence pancreatic islet function and glucose homeostasis, yet the specific role of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated D2R’s impact on T1DM progression and its underlying signaling mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. MIN6 pancreatic beta cells were treated with D2R agonist quinpirole (50 μM), antagonist haloperidol (10 μM), or their combination, followed by 24-h streptozotocin (STZ) exposure. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assays, apoptosis was evaluated through TUNEL staining and caspase-3/9 expression analysis, insulin secretion was measured by ELISA, and AKT pathway activation was examined via Western blot. Additionally, DRD2 knockout (DRD2-/-) mice were subjected to STZ-induced T1DM to validate in vitro findings. Results demonstrated that quinpirole significantly reduced MIN6 cell viability, enhanced apoptosis markers (cleaved caspase-3/9), decreased insulin secretion, and suppressed phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression in STZ-treated cells. These detrimental effects were partially mitigated by haloperidol co-treatment. Importantly, DRD2-/-mice showed significantly higher insulin levels in both peripheral blood and pancreatic tissue compared to wild-type T1DM mice, suggesting D2R deficiency confers protection against STZ-induced beta-cell dysfunction. These findings collectively indicate that D2R activation negatively regulates pancreatic beta-cell survival and insulin secretion through AKT pathway suppression, positioning D2R as a potential therapeutic target for T1DM intervention.},

  abstract = {Against the backdrop of digital transformation in education, the integration of Mixed Reality (MR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fostered a new “virtual-physical symbiotic” learning environment. However, current educational tools often fail to capture learners’ dynamic needs and the characteristics of 3D immersive scenarios, resulting in a disconnect between virtual character interactions and the teaching process. Existing approaches face various limitations: rule-based models struggle with the dynamics of three-dimensional spaces; collaborative filtering algorithms overlook spatial contextual features; and deep learning models lack joint modeling of emotion and context. These shortcomings highlight insufficient multi-source data integration and weak situational awareness. To address these challenges, this study proposes a virtual character recommendation method tailored to immersive learning environments. The model is composed of a transformation layer, a self-adversarial data generation layer, an embedding representation layer, and a virtual character prediction layer. It achieves dynamic matching between virtual characters and 3D interactive scenarios by incorporating multi-source data standardization, intelligent agent-based game simulation for scenario data generation, semantic vectorization of character features, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-attention mechanism fusion. This research marks the first application of MR spatial computation and self-adversarial learning in educational role recommendation, offering a technical framework to tackle adaptation challenges in immersive scene recommendations. The proposed approach contributes both theoretical innovations and practical guidance for the advancement of intelligent education.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes can cause fatal damage to concrete bridges. To enhance the seismic resistance of reinforced concrete bridge structures, a finite element model of a continuous reinforced concrete beam bridge is designed using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, and a calculation method for the overall equivalent damping ratio of the bridge is designed based on this bridge type. In the case analysis, the designed calculation method has a smaller relative displacement error at the pier top under seismic loads compared to traditional calculation methods. As the longitudinal reinforcement ratio of the pier column section increases, the bearing capacity of the section significantly increases, while the corresponding ultimate curvature decreases. The greater the yield strength of the longitudinal reinforcement in the pier column section, the greater the bearing capacity of the pier column section, but the displacement ductility coefficient of the section shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. For the reinforcement ratio of the pier column section, increasing the reinforcement ratio does not significantly improve the bearing capacity of the pier column section, but the displacement ductility of the section is significantly improved. The yield strength of the hoop reinforcement is increased from 250 MPa to 550 MPa, and the maximum bending moment of the pier column section and the maximum bending moment in the elastic stage are increased by 3.84% and 1.85%, respectively. It can be seen that this method has a small error under seismic loads and has good application advantages in bridge seismic design. The research content will provide effective technical references for the design of concrete structures for building bridges, as well as seismic construction and maintenance of bridges.},

  abstract = {This article proposes an innovative embedded dynamic decision-making framework (KD-DRL) to address the key issues of insufficient interpretability and low training efficiency faced by intelligent decision-making systems in industry academia integration platforms. This framework achieves collaborative optimization of data-driven methods and domain knowledge through the organic integration of deep reinforcement learning and explicit knowledge reasoning, providing a new technological path for intelligent decision-making in complex educational scenarios. In terms of method design, KD-DRL innovatively constructs a dual module knowledge system: the heuristic acceleration knowledge module guides agents to explore efficiently in the early stages of training through intelligent intervention mechanisms, significantly reducing model convergence time; The evasive security knowledge module is based on formal rules to monitor the decision-making process in real time, effectively preventing potential risks. This hierarchical knowledge architecture not only retains the ability of deep reinforcement learning to handle high-dimensional state spaces, but also ensures the reliability and security of decisions through interpretable rule constraints. Experimental verification shows that in the multimodal data environment of real industry academia platforms, KD-DRL exhibits significant advantages: in terms of training efficiency, the model convergence speed is improved by more than 40% compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning methods; In terms of safety, the incidence of teaching accidents has been reduced to below 0.3%, while maintaining a reasonable intervention frequency; In terms of interpretability, the decision-making process supports rule tracing, and the average time for experts to verify a single decision logic is controlled within 5 s.},

Based on this, this study constructed a personalized recommendation system that integrates the GloVe model to capture words' distributed representation, effectively improving resource recommendations' accuracy and relevance. The recommendation system preprocesses large-scale English learning resources and generates personalized resource recommendation lists based on learners' historical learning behaviors and preferences. During the experiment, a three-month test was conducted on 100 learners with different levels of English proficiency, and corresponding usage feedback and learning effectiveness data were collected. The experimental results showed that compared to traditional recommendation methods, the recommendation system based on GloVe improved resource matching by 35% and learner satisfaction by 40%. A survey found that 80% of learners reported that recommended resources better met their learning needs, and their learning efficiency increased by an average of 25%. The system also promoted the growth of learners' vocabulary. The experimental group learners increased their vocabulary by an average of 1500 words within 3 months, significantly higher than the 800 words in the control group.

  abstract = {This study, based on the Guanzhong Road tunnel project in the core urban area of Chongqing, systematically investigates the influence of tunnel excavation on adjacent building structures by establishing a tunnel-building interaction numerical model. A two-dimensional plane strain model was developed using MIDAS/GTS software, focusing on the response mechanisms of key factors such as horizontal spacing, soil layer parameters, and building height on building deformation. The research reveals that the horizontal spacing between the tunnel and the building significantly affects the settlement distribution characteristics. When the spacing is 15 m, the settlement difference between the head and tail of the building reaches 1.94 mm, and the established displacement prediction formula effectively characterizes the nonlinear relationship between horizontal distance and displacement. The elastic modulus of the soil plays a decisive role in deformation, with the maximum settlement in silty clay formation (E is 20 MPa) increasing by 572% compared to sandy mudstone formation (E is 60 MPa), reaching 15.9 mm. Increasing building height exacerbates settlement differences, with the settlement difference of a 30 m high-rise building (2.29 mm) increasing by 487% compared to a 12 m low-rise building (0.39 mm). The study proposes 35 m as the horizontal safety spacing threshold and recommends the Cross Diaphragm (CRD) method or the large pipe roof method for highly compressible formations to control the formation loss rate (&lt;0.5%). The research findings provide a theoretical basis for risk assessment and construction method optimization in tunnel proximity construction in urban core areas.},

  abstract = {With acceleration of globalization, English learning has become a compulsory course for many learners. However, traditional English learning methods are often inefficient and difficult to meet the needs of modern learners. Therefore, this study aims to design and apply an efficient English learning system based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm. The Jaro-Winkler algorithm is a string similarity calculation method which can effectively measure the similarity between words so as to assist learners in memorizing and mastering English vocabulary more effectively. Firstly, this study analyzes the pain points in current English learning, such as insufficient vocabulary and poor grammar mastery, and proposes corresponding solutions. By introducing the Jaro-Winkler algorithm, the system can intelligently recommend words with high similarity for learning and improve learning efficiency. The experimental results show that learners who use this system have an average increase of 30% in vocabulary and a 20% decrease in grammatical error rate within 3 months. In addition, the system also provides a personalized learning path and real-time feedback mechanism, further enhancing learners’ learning motivation and effect. This study not only provides new ideas and methods for English learning but also provides a reference for the design of other language learning systems.},

  abstract = {Currently, the “dual-channel” drug management system has become an important channel for hospital and external supply chain drug management. However, how to achieve more efficient drug management is still the main issue in current drug management. Therefore, in order to achieve more efficient drug management. A new “dual-channel” drug management system based on hospital information system was proposed, which uses deep bidirectional network and convolutional recurrent neural network models to identify and manage drugs. At the same time, the new system uses deconvolution and binarization methods to improve the accuracy of drug recognition. The research results show that the accuracy of drug recognition in the model can reach 95.68%, which is 13.33% higher than other models. At the same time, the recall rate was also improved by 14.89% compared to other models. After using the new system, the number of effective image recognitions increased by 10, and the hospital’s revenue growth increased by 7.43%. The new system has better drug management effects and can also improve drug sales efficiency. This has good guiding significance for hospital drug management research.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of mental health to the quality of human life and social development, as well as its central position in education in the new era, this paper focuses on the critical group of college students, aiming to optimize the teaching mode of online mental health education through technological innovation, to improve their psychological quality and coping ability. Given the significant changes in college students’ lifestyles, learning modes and communication styles in the Internet era, this paper profoundly analyses these changes’ positive and negative impacts on mental health. In particular, it is pointed out that the incidence of mental health problems among Chinese college students has risen to more than 20%, with depression, anxiety, Internet addiction, and emotional problems being particularly prominent, which seriously constrain students’ academic achievements and quality of life, and may even induce undesirable behaviors. In order to effectively deal with this situation, this paper identifies several key factors affecting the effectiveness of learning based on an in-depth analysis of students’ online psychological learning behaviors. It proposes an optimized collaborative filtering algorithm accordingly. In order to overcome the performance bottleneck and sparsity problems that traditional collaborative filtering algorithms may encounter when dealing with large-scale datasets, we propose an improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on a hybrid strategy, which achieves fine-grained modeling of students’ psychological and behavioral patterns by combining the advantages of SVD++ matrix decomposition, neural network embedding, and content filtering, and through the fusion of multi-source data and feature intersection. The algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy of students’ learning behaviors and achieves an increase of about 30% in the accuracy rate compared with traditional methods. This research result provides a powerful tool for accurately identifying students’ psychological needs and potential problems. It lays a solid foundation for universities to carry out personalized and high-performance online mental health education models.},

Personalized education, which caters to each learner’s unique needs, forms the foundation of adaptive English teaching. This approach promotes multicultural awareness, linguistic proficiency, and confidence. This study focuses on utilizing AI and NLP to deliver personalized English instruction.

  abstract = {Recycled coarse aggregate exhibits significant heterogeneity in its physical and chemical properties, along with complex interdependencies among various feature attributes. These characteristics often lead to challenges in achieving high accuracy in attribute recognition, highlighting the urgent need for a structured and intelligent analytical framework. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with attribute mathematics theory, aiming to enhance feature representation and improve recognition performance. The method begins by constructing a multi-dimensional attribute graph based on the physicochemical properties of recycled coarse aggregate, capturing the intrinsic correlations among different features. A multilayer GCN is then employed to extract deep-level, globally coupled feature representations. Subsequently, attribute mathematics theory is applied to simplify and logically abstract the output features through membership functions and covering operators, enabling effective feature selection and dimensionality reduction. The refined feature set is finally fed into a discriminant classifier to achieve accurate attribute recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion model over traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, random forest, and MLP. The model achieves average recognition accuracies and recall rates of 0.89 and 0.89 across eight material categories, and 0.90 and 0.89 across seven particle size ranges, respectively. Five-fold cross-validation yields an average accuracy between 0.889 and 0.918, with a low standard deviation of 0.012, indicating strong stability and generalization performance. Moreover, the feature simplification strategy achieves an average feature reduction rate of 0.67 while retaining 0.92 of the original information. These results confirm that the proposed GCN–attribute mathematics framework significantly enhances the attribute recognition capability of recycled coarse aggregate, offering a robust and efficient solution for intelligent identification in sustainable construction materials research.},

  abstract = {With the explosive growth of digital resources in libraries, the limitations of traditional recommendation systems have become increasingly prominent. The collaborative filtering algorithm is affected by the sparsity of the user-item matrix and is difficult to capture long-tail requirements. The low efficiency of association rule mining leads to serious homogenization of recommendation results. How to break through technical bottlenecks and achieve precise and diverse resource recommendations has become the key to enhancing user experience and promoting the construction of smart libraries. Therefore, a library resource recommendation model that integrates collaborative filtering and association rules is developed to optimize the accuracy and personalization of library resource recommendations. First, the research introduces user attribute features and clustering algorithms to improve collaborative filtering algorithms. Then, a library resource recommendation model is constructed by integrating association rules. Finally, the model is tested. The test results showed that in terms of recommendation diversity, when the number of neighbors was 50, the research model generated 560 unique recommendation items, which was significantly better than traditional content-based recommendation models. In terms of coverage indicators, the research model stabilized at 42%, which was 17% to 30% higher than comparison methods. In real library scenario testing, the research model could identify and recommend six randomly selected user accounts.

As a unique painting medium, the mixing effect of watercolor pigments presents complex physical and chemical characteristics, which makes the accurate simulation face great challenges. In this paper, a simulation and optimization algorithm of watercolor paint mixing effect based on graph neural network is proposed.

The results showed that the macro/micro robotic arm was accurate in tracking the position and attitude of the trajectory, with only 0.1° in the β-Euler angle. The joint motion of the robotic arm and the driving speed of the micro robotic arm were maintained within reasonable limits.

  abstract = {Fabric defect detection (DD) is critical in ensuring high-quality textile production, as defects can significantly impact aesthetic appeal and market value. Manual inspection methods are often inefficient and prone to inconsistency, motivating the development of intelligent, automated systems. Despite advancements in computer vision and deep learning (DL), many current models, such as rule-based methods involving thresholding and edge detection, still face challenges in accurately detecting subtle or complex defects under varied lighting and texture conditions. This research addresses these gaps by proposing a novel, DL-driven model named Binary Gannet Optimizer-driven Gate Adjusted Long Short-Term Memory Network (BGO-GALSTM-Net) for robust and precise defect detection and classification in textiles. A comprehensive dataset, ensuring diversity in defect types such as stains, holes, and misweaves, is used to train and evaluate the proposed model. Data preprocessing involves contrast enhancement and edge-preserving smoothing to improve defect visibility. Feature extraction uses a residual network (ResNet), allowing the model to focus on intricate defect regions. The proposed BGO-GALSTM-Net integrates temporal memory capabilities of LSTM with adaptive gating, while the Binary Gannet Optimizer fine-tunes model parameters for optimal performance. This architecture effectively processes the input image data, learns spatiotemporal patterns, and classifies defect types with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy (97.4%) along with higher F1-score, precision, and recall across various fabric types, outperforming traditional approaches.

  abstract = {In modern Software-Defined Networking (SDN), traffic engineering often faces critical challenges in maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) due to congestion over bottleneck links. Existing traffic engineering (TE) schemes frequently overlook the performance degradation caused by such bottlenecks, resulting in inefficient routing and poor load balancing. To address this issue, we model the traffic allocation problem as a bottleneck game with splittable flows, where users compete for shared bottleneck resources and select routes based on a link pricing strategy. We propose a distributed routing algorithm based on bottleneck game theory (DRB), which introduces a pricing application-driven network routing mechanism between users and the SDN controller. The controller periodically monitors link utilization, updates link prices accordingly, and broadcasts them to users. Each user independently selects the lowest-cost path, implicitly guided by bottleneck usage. This mechanism effectively steers traffic away from congested paths, minimizes queuing delay, and achieves global load balancing, thereby ensuring improved QoS. Extensive simulations on real-world topologies from the SNDlib dataset, including Abilene and GEANT, validate the effectiveness of DRB. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Hedera and ECMP, the proposed DRB algorithm consistently achieves higher throughput, lower latency, reduced jitter, and minimized packet loss under varying traffic demand levels. These results demonstrate that DRB effectively mitigates bottleneck-induced congestion and enhances QoS in SDN-based networks.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart agriculture has become a new direction in the development of modern agriculture. This study aims to enhance the utilization of agricultural resources and strengthen the intelligent and scientific management of crop growth. Given the low efficiency, high cost, and insufficient monitoring accuracy of the current traditional agricultural monitoring methods, this study analyzes the key technologies in the domestic and international agricultural IoT field based on the current situation of China’s agriculture. A smart agricultural monitoring system is proposed that combines convolutional neural network (CNN), IoT, and blockchain technology. The system addresses issues such as low efficiency, excessive cost, and inadequate monitoring precision present in traditional agricultural information systems. Meanwhile, it adopts a modular design to enhance scalability and employs a multitasking scheduling mechanism similar to an operating system to ensure high stability. This study also proposes a blockchain-based IoT data platform and designs simulated experiments to verify the system’s performance. The dataset used in the study includes photographic materials of corn from germination to maturity across six growth stages, covering an area of approximately 15 square meters, with images captured from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Moreover, it selects images from the corn planting period, encompassing a vast amount of image data across six growth stages, of which about 20% of data is used for the test set. The results show that the recommended model has different recognition rates for corn crops at diverse growth stages, with an overall recognition error rate, weighted averaged, ranging only from 0.18% to 3.53%. In addition, the model can predict factors affecting crop growth with high precision. The blockchain data storage model still demonstrates excellent system performance under high transaction throughput, meeting the performance requirements of IoT systems. This study fills several research gaps in intelligent agricultural management information systems and provides practical guidance and insights for the application effects of “blockchain + deep learning” technology in sustainable rural development.},

  abstract = {In today’s competitive digital landscape, brands constantly require innovative ways to engage consumers and generate memorable experiences. Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a powerful tool for transforming traditional brand interactions into immersive, interactive experiences. However, conventional methods often fail to attain high realism, faultless interaction, and adaptive consumer engagement. To address these challenges, this research addresses an AR-based technology that develops the creation of immersive brand experiences through interactive graphic design elements. The Dynamic Dung Beetle Optimizer-Driven Stacked Convolutional Neural Network (DDB-Stacked CNN) is employed for image recognition and AR product design optimization, enhancing user engagement in branding. To ensure high-quality AR-driven graphic design elements, image datasets, consumer interaction data, and branding elements were gathered from various sources. The collected data was preprocessed using image enhancement techniques to improve clarity, while a Kalman filter was applied to reduce noise. Dynamic Dung Beetle Optimization (DDBO) is a global search capability that enables real-time optimization of AR-driven interactive design elements, allowing brands to deliver personalized and visually compelling experiences. The framework is implemented in Python, and the findings indicate that the proposed model significantly increases user engagement and improves brand recall and accuracy compared to conventional techniques. This research highlights the transformative potential of deep learning (DL)-enhanced AR graphic design in fostering stronger brand connections, setting a new benchmark for immersive and interactive brand experiences in the digital age.},

  abstract = {In the past, the evaluation of teacher’s teaching ability mainly relied on qualitative evaluation methods, often influenced by subjective factors. Nowadays, student evaluation of teaching is an essential means of monitoring teaching quality, as well as a right and obligation of students. To accurately obtain teaching evaluation results, evaluate the teaching ability, and improve teaching quality, clustering analysis of teaching evaluation data is studied. It adopts an improved K-modes clustering and a neural network prediction model based on machine learning to predict the effectiveness of online learning for students. It conducts experiments to verify it. Experimental studies have shown that the absolute error of training results is 54% in the range of 0–1, and 7% in the range of greater than 3. The similarity between the initial cluster centers selected by the random method and the cluster centers of the sample data is unstable, while the cluster centers from minimizing the sum of squared errors are closer to the sample data. The clustering effect of removing abnormal data is more concentrated. The accuracy of the clustering center distance calculation method studied is 0.9816, while other methods are 0.9321 and 0.9287. The calculated cluster center distances are stable, including values of 0.8307, 0.8547, and 0.8325. It showcases that research methods and predictive models can optimize the evaluation of higher education.

To address this issue, this study introduces a deep learning-based framework utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) to enhance cost prediction accuracy and improve optimization strategies under dynamic conditions. The proposed approach begins with the collection and preprocessing of construction material cost data, including the handling of missing values, outliers, and duplicate records. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then applied to extract key features and reduce data dimensionality. A VAE model is subsequently constructed, in which both encoder and decoder networks map high-dimensional data into a compact latent space.

As a result, corporate credit risk has become increasingly important to monitor and assess accurately. Due to the low operational efficiency and high personnel costs associated with traditional credit risk assessment models, this study opted for an artificial intelligence model with support vector machines for risk assessment. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment model and make it more suitable for the financial characteristics of enterprises, a particle swarm algorithm was introduced to optimize the support vector machine model. For the choice of measurement indicators, the experiment extracted nine indicators with a cumulative contribution of 80% or more from 20 original indicators by means of principal component analysis as the experimental indicators. The model test results showed that the model had the greatest overall classification accuracy and recall rate, which were 89.44% and 58.83%, respectively. Meanwhile, the improved support vector machine model had the lowest misclassification rates for the first and second categories, at 24.45% and 16.74%, respectively. This indicates that the model is more likely to detect enterprises that can incur credit risk and can achieve the research objective with high applicability.},

  abstract = {Background
            HIV-PrEP is a key component of HIV combination prevention and has been routinely available through oral formulations (i.e. oral tablets) across sexual health services (SHSs) in the UK since 2020. We used data from a large, online community survey to assess the acceptability and preference of different HIV-PrEP modalities among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and gender-diverse individuals living in the UK.
          
          
            Methods
            Using data collected from the ‘Reducing inequalities in Sexual Health’ (RiiSH) survey, an online community survey of 1106 GBMSM and gender-diverse individuals having sex with men (November/December 2023), we performed a secondary analysis examining HIV-PrEP modality acceptability and preference (e.g. oral, long acting injectable, gel, or patch) (%) by HIV-PrEP history (never, in lookback period of last 3–4 months since survey completion). Where ≥2 modalities were indicated, participants were asked to specify a single preferred modality. Single choice options were assumed to be the preferred HIV-PrEP modality.
          
          
            Results
            Irrespective of HIV-PrEP history, long acting injectables were highly acceptable (&gt;70%) and the preferred modality (58% [222/386] by those never having used HIV-PrEP, 73% [75/103] in those without HIV-PrEP use in the lookback, 74% [314/424] in those with HIV-PrEP use in the lookback).
          
          
            Conclusions
            We found high acceptability of the use of injectables, with general preference over oral tablets. If injectable HIV-PrEP becomes available at SHSs in England, these modalities could have positive impacts on HIV-PrEP delivery, use, and access.},

In order to study the relationship between entrepreneurship, business environment and regional economic development, a regression model was constructed based on the panel data of various provinces in China from 2020 to 2022, and the stepwise regression and ridge regression methods were used for analysis. Stepwise regression selects the explanatory variables that contribute the most to the model by gradually adding or removing variables. Ridge regression introduces regularization terms to solve the multicollinearity problem in the model and improve the stability of parameter estimation. The analysis results show that the coefficient of impact of the business environment on economic development is 0.33. At a confidence level of 1%, the regression coefficients between business environment and entrepreneurial innovation and entrepreneurship are 0.256 and 0.064. It is clear that business environment optimization can significantly promote regional economic development, in which entrepreneurship is the key intermediary. In addition, a quality business environment can reduce business costs, improve market vitality, encourage entrepreneurs to innovate and start businesses, and drive economic growth through efficient allocation of resources and knowledge sharing. Optimizing the business environment and fostering entrepreneurship are effective ways to promote regional economic prosperity.},

Traditional methods face challenges in noisy data environments, limited model generalization, and poor adaptability in dynamic settings. Rule-based inference methods struggle with environmental variability, and single reinforcement learning models are constrained by sample efficiency and strategy transfer limitations. This research introduces a GAN-based dynamic denoising mechanism in which the generator simulates noise distributions to create pseudo-noise samples, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and noisy data. The adversarial training iteratively enhances data quality. Experiments show that this approach improves the signal-to-noise ratio by over 20%, significantly reducing the interference of noise in GLM-4 inference. Transfer Reinforcement Learning facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enhancing learning efficiency in multi-agent collaborative tasks. A state-action value function-based transfer strategy is designed, enabling the migration of learned policy parameters and feature representations from source to target tasks, thereby reducing exploration costs. In multi-agent contract management experiments, this method increased convergence speed by 33% while maintaining policy stability.},

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze the impact of entrepreneurship and innovation education on college students’ creativity. In order to enhance the credibility of the results, the propensity score matching method (PSM) was also used to verify the impact of participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education on students’ creativity. The analysis results show that the current creativity score of college students in my country is 107.6, which is at an average level; students who do not participate in entrepreneurship and innovation education have the lowest creativity score, and students who are rich in imagination and dare to take risks are more willing to actively participate in entrepreneurship and innovation education. OLS regression and PSM results show that participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education will significantly and positively affect the creativity of college students. Among them, active participation and both types of participation have significant effects on college students’ creativity, while passive participation has no significant effect. Therefore, colleges and universities need to carry out entrepreneurship and innovation education in a variety of ways, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of students to participate, and improve the level of students’ creativity.

First, the research data is primarily derived from questionnaires, which may not fully capture the developmental status and challenges of the entire red cultural and creative industry due to sample size and regional constraints. Secondly, the specific processes and practical implementation details of fuzzy control theory are not thoroughly explored, potentially limiting its applicability and effectiveness within the industry. The study’s focus is largely on identifying existing issues and proposing countermeasures, with less emphasis on forward-looking analyses of emerging challenges and problems that may arise in the future. Finally, the examination of interactions among policy, market dynamics, technology, and talent remains limited, preventing a deeper exploration of the complex relationships and comprehensive impact these factors have on industry development. Addressing these limitations in future research could enhance understanding and further support the robust development of red cultural and creative industries.},

  abstract = {Cultural threat is one of the main explanations for opposing immigrants. However, it lacks theoretical precision and suffers from measurement issues. To remedy these problems, we conceptualize cultural threat as a zero-sum problem and specify concrete cultural rights that Muslims receive. In two online experiments in Germany, we randomly assigned people to situations where Muslim cultural rights either replace majority rights (zero-sum) or they co-exist (non-zero-sum). The willingness to accommodate Muslims’ cultural rights varies strongly by the logic of cultural threat, especially for respondents with an inclusionary mindset. They are protective of their own cultural practices, but do not perceive all gains in Muslim rights as inherently threatening. Respondents with an exclusionary mindset, however, respond less to variations in cultural threat. In contrast to people with an inclusionary mindset, they also react more negatively to Muslim than non-Muslim demands for change.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of enterprise business scale, the amount of financial data is growing exponentially, and massive data has become the core resource for enterprise development. However, many enterprises have not yet established a comprehensive intelligent data analysis system, resulting in significant challenges in daily data collection and frequent loss of critical financial data, which seriously restricts the further development of enterprises. Although existing research has explored financial data processing, there are still shortcomings in the combination of algorithm efficiency and system practicality. For example, some studies focus too much on theoretical model construction, resulting in low data processing efficiency in practical applications; some systems struggle to meet the accuracy and automation requirements of enterprise analysis when faced with complex and heterogeneous financial data. In the field of intelligent computing, the chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm provides a new approach for financial data classification and automatic analysis and processing due to its global search capability and parallel computing advantages. This article is based on the chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm, and deeply studies and designs an intelligent financial data processing system. By proposing adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and simplified adaptive particle swarm optimization (RAPSO) algorithms, the data processing flow is optimized. The research results show that the system significantly improves the efficiency and automation level of financial data processing. 52% of enterprises believe that the automation level of system data analysis is high, and the RAPSO algorithm significantly shortens the data processing time compared to the APSO algorithm. However, this study only focuses on the preliminary exploration of enterprise financial data processing. In the future, algorithm application scenarios can be further expanded to optimize system functions to meet more complex business needs.},

  abstract = {Nano-powders have revolutionized the beauty and cosmetic industry, introducing groundbreaking innovations in product formulation and skin protection. Cutting-edge cosmetology leverages titania nanopowders to enhance pigmentation and luminosity in various beauty products, including eye shadows, lipsticks, balms, and lotions. These nanoscale particles not only amplify esthetic qualities but also provide advanced functional benefits including improved hydration, durability, facial radiance, and anti-wrinkling characteristics. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles have also shown enhanced tunability in emerging cosmetic applications. The intersection of scientific research and cosmetic technology has led to fascinating developments in nanofluid dynamics. Motivated by the manufacturing fluid dynamics of nano-cosmetics, in the present work we investigate the non-Newtonian magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) titania-magnesium oxide/methanol (wood spirit) cosmetic nanoliquid dynamics from a stretching surface with a power-law velocity. The Casson viscoplastic model is deployed for rheological effects. Convective and radiative heat transfer are included in the transport model as are viscous heating, internal heat source and wall transpiration (suction/injection) effects. A Tiwari-Das volume fraction formulation is adopted for nanofluid properties. The primitive conservation equations with associated boundary conditions are transformed into a nonlinear coupled ordinary differential boundary value problem which is solved computationally with the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg technique. Validation with previous studies ignoring nanoparticles is included. The innovative hybrid nanoflow composition, combining MgO and TiO
            2
            , demonstrates remarkable potential in both cosmetic and industrial applications. When suspended in non-Newtonian cosmetic creams and exposed to sunlight, the hybrid nanoparticles lead to improved heat transfer properties of hybrid nanofluid suspensions. Notably, they can help mitigate skin tanning during exposure to intense solar radiation, by effectively managing thermal radiation and energy transmission to the skin’s surface. Hybrid nanofluids are observed to transfer more energy away from the stretchable surface when internal viscous dissipation and heat generation are present. The optically thin nano-cosmetic fluids simulated using the Rosseland flux model exhibit a decrease in energy transmission rate. Computations also show that as wall suction or injection escalates, skin friction decreases. Overall enhanced thermal management in cosmetic formulations is produced with MgO and TiO

  abstract = {Rapid and accurate assessment of college students’ mental health status is an important task in college mental health education and is also the basis for accurate intervention and personalized education services in college psychological work. The traditional evaluation methods have some problems, such as low real-time evaluation, poor evaluation effect of single-modal data, and social approval response bias. Social media big data provides a new way to predict college students’ mental health status in real time and accurately. This paper constructs a mental health prediction model based on web text data. BERT language framework is applied to psychological trait prediction, and BERT bidirectional training mode and Transformer coding module are used to mine more complete contextual semantic features and longer distance contextual dependencies, which solves the problem of enhancement vector representation of psychological trait semantic features. At the same time, considering that the difference in the internal structure of the classifier may lead to different classification effects, the fully connected layer of BERT model and the classical random forest algorithm are, respectively, used as two different classifiers in the downstream classification task to compare the model effects. The results show that BERT-B model has the greatest superiority, the prediction accuracy rate reaches 97.25%, the accuracy rate reaches 96.66%, the recall rate reaches 99.61%, the F1 value reaches 98.11%, and the AUC area reaches 99.44%, which can effectively predict the mental health status. The importance of this study is that it not only provides a fast, accurate and cost-effective mental health assessment tool for colleges and universities but also provides strong data support for personalized intervention and precise implementation of mental health services. The successful application of this innovative model marks an important step in the deep integration and value mining of social media big data in the field of mental health research and has great significance in promoting the modernization and scientific education of mental health.},

Optimization has been carried out to address the accuracy and reliability issues of the simulation system caused by the lack of training data and the difference between real data. On this basis, we designed an automatic text modification model to improve the performance of Chinese character recognition.

The research results show that generative adversarial network algorithms have significant applicability in Chinese writing style simulation systems. Through optimization processing, we have successfully improved the effectiveness of text recognition and the accuracy of style simulation. This study indicates that a Chinese writing style simulation system based on generative adversarial networks can effectively improve students’ text recognition ability and writing style simulation accuracy.

According to that, the present study suggests a novel method for managing healthcare by combining an intelligent decision-making framework with Digital Twin (DT) technologies into a patient-centered Health Management System (HMS) especially for elderly patients. The technology uses seniors’ real-time data to build effective DT of virtual duplicates that continuously monitor and reflects each person’s health profile. With the help of these DT, real-time health management and predictive analytics are made easier, which allows the system to independently recommend individualized lifestyle adjustments and treatments based on ongoing monitoring. The present study utilizes the integrated digital twin concepts. To monitor the individual patient health data in real time, local twin is used, performed based on the condition-based monitoring (CBM) modules, whereas the global twin helps to combine the data across multiple patients and allowing broader analysis. Additionally, the decision-making process is performed with the help of fuzzy inference system (FIS) based on the system’s overall production rate. Finally, the simulation of the study is performed regarding varying health conditions of patients, which improves the healthcare outcomes through decentralized data-driven approaches. A novel prototype of “Health-Pro” was developed by the inspiration of the existing study, and tested with 43 seniors with the age between 60 and 85. 80% of participants agreed that the system supported to improved health awareness and self-management. Participants stated a promising improvement in their attitude towards controlling their health. Key prerequisites for successful implementation were also observed by the study, and these include the importance of privacy controls, adjustable interfaces and social networking factors. Overall, this innovative method of managing health opens the door for more efficient, flexible healthcare options that are sensitive to each patient’s unique demands, thereby improving senior citizens’ quality of life and health results.},

  abstract = {Teacher-related factors significantly impact students’ higher-order thinking. However, the mechanisms of how these factors specifically affect students’ higher-order thinking in urban science classrooms are unclear, especially in the absence of empirical research based on multimodal assessment methodologies. This study explored the pathways of these factors by constructing a structural equation model and implemented a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment in an urban science classroom to collect brain data, exploring the mechanisms of students’ higher-order thinking development. The results indicated that both teacher-student relationships and scaffolding instruction could positively influence students’ higher-order thinking, and teacher-student relationships could promote students’ higher-order thinking through the chained mediating role of teacher guidance and scaffolding instruction, while teacher guidance alone had a significant negative effect on students’ higher-order thinking. Furthermore, students’ higher-order thinking during the science class using the scaffolding strategy was related to the increased interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the teacher and students’ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—a neural basis associated with effective teacher-student interaction. These findings confirm the importance of the teachers’ role during students’ higher-order thinking development and provide evidence from both the structural equation modeling and brain science for the mechanisms behind higher-order thinking development.},

By collecting and analysing 1500 valid questionnaires, combined with descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis, this study deeply discusses how the big data of the Internet of Things can optimise the evaluation method of the social influence of red culture, and puts forward effective improvement strategies. The results show that the application of IoT big data significantly improves the public’s awareness of red culture, and its data diversity, real-time performance and depth of analysis play a key role in improving the accuracy of assessment. The public’s emotional attitude towards and participation in red culture have a significant positive impact on the improvement of awareness.

However, although these loans create substantial money for financial institutions, they also pose a huge risk. The traditional approach to loan applicants includes auditors assessing them based on their prior employment experience; however, this method has the problem of being sluggish and imprecise. This article describes the creation of an intelligent loan evaluation system by inventively using oil consumption data. The system uses a decision tree model to fulfill the aim of constructing a system that can predict the rate of bad debt acquired by loan customers. As a requirement for system building, solutions to the following innovative difficulties have to be discovered. To get substantial results, a feature derivation approach and formula are used to the decision tree model. While significantly increasing review speed, the poor rate falls from 7.8% to 1.6%, while the approved rate rises from less than 17% to more than 45%.

Under backfill mining conditions, ground deformation in the inclination and horizontal directions was only about 4.1% of that under conventional mining. Numerical simulation results indicated that during conventional mining, surface displacement showed little change when the working face advanced between 50 m and 200 m. However, a large fracture extending to the surface occurred in the roof strata at an advance distance of 200 m. When the advance reached 350 m–450 m, the rate of surface vertical displacement change slowed, with a maximum vertical subsidence of 1.26 m. In contrast, for paste backfill mining, surface horizontal displacement remained almost unchanged compared to conventional mining, but the vertical surface subsidence was reduced to 0.016 m, accounting for only 1.2% of the subsidence under conventional mining. Furthermore, backfill mining eliminated the zones and periods of intense strata subsidence. Comparing the two conditions shows that backfill mining reduces surface subsidence by dozens of times. This keeps building damage within Grade I (extremely slight damage), requiring no repair. The research results provide valuable references for understanding and controlling surface strata movement patterns in this mine and under similar mining conditions.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the teaching effect of music appreciation course, this paper combines artificial neural network to build a model for improving music appreciation ability, and studies the two major characteristics of music wave oscillation and attenuation. Due to the existence of the frequency of the music wave, the electromagnetic wave less than its frequency cannot pass through the music wave, which makes the music wave can be used in the protection of high-power microwaves. The incident electromagnetic wave will be absorbed and reflected after entering the music wave. Therefore, a calculation model of the transmission power of the electromagnetic wave entering the music wave is proposed. From the analysis of teaching experiment data, it can be seen that the music appreciation model based on artificial neural network proposed in this paper can effectively improve students’ music appreciation ability.},

In this paper, the application of computer technology in macroeconomic uncertainty analysis is deeply discussed. By combining questionnaire design, data collection, model selection, implementation, and validation, it reveals how computer technology has brought unprecedented convenience and accuracy to macroeconomic research. The results show that, especially in economic strategy simulation, the application of computer parallelization technology greatly accelerates the training and verification process of the model.

  abstract = {Background:
            While psychedelics are often claimed to enhance creativity, their precise effects on distinct stages of creative cognition remain poorly understood. This study investigated the acute effects of an ayahuasca-inspired formulation combining N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine (DMT/HAR), as well as harmine alone (HAR), on micro-level (divergent/convergent thinking) and macro-level (creative process dynamics) creativity.
          
          
            Methods:
            In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design, 30 healthy male participants completed three sessions (DMT/HAR, HAR, placebo). Micro-level creativity was assessed using the picture concept task (convergent thinking) and alternative uses task (divergent thinking). Macro-level dynamics were examined through a real-world painting task using the creative process report diary, which captured dynamic stage transitions. Subjective experiences were also recorded to explore their predictive value for creativity.
          
          
            Results:
            DMT/HAR significantly impaired convergent thinking, particularly in individuals with higher baseline reasoning. Divergent thinking showed no overall effect but revealed trend-level reductions in fluency and elaboration under DMT/HAR. At the macro-level, both DMT/HAR and HAR reduced incubation-related transitions, while DMT/HAR uniquely decreased transitions from incubation to illumination, suggesting altered pathways to insight. Subjective experiences such as altered meaning perception and increased insightfulness selectively predicted divergent, but not convergent, thinking outcomes.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            This study demonstrates that the effects of DMT/HAR on creativity are not uniform. By capturing real-world creative behavior through an ecologically valid painting task, this study offers the first evidence that psychedelics influence not only creative cognition but also the dynamic processes that give rise to it. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive, phenomenological and process-level perspectives to better understand creative thinking under altered states. Future research should further investigate how individual differences in subjective experience and cognitive style modulate the unfolding of creative processes under psychedelics.},

Within this landscape, the information disseminated through take-out O2O platform reviews has emerged as a pivotal factor influencing consumer decisions when opting for food delivery services. This study centers on scrutinizing online reviews sourced from take-out O2O platforms. It establishes a research framework wherein online reviews function as the independent variable, consumer purchase intentions as the dependent variable, perceived risk as the mediator impacting the influence of online reviews on purchase intent, and consumer trust propensity as the moderator in the relationship between online reviews and perceived risk. Hypotheses are formulated and rigorously examined through empirical methodologies to ascertain the validity of the research framework and its underpinning assumptions. The findings of this study affirm that online reviews on take-out O2O platforms, encompassing criteria such as review quantity, quality, valence, timeliness, and visual cues, wield a marked positive influence on consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, online reviews exhibit a discernible negative impact on perceived risk. Notably, perceived risk plays a pivotal role as a partial mediator in the pathway through which online reviews influence consumer purchase intentions. Moreover, the study elucidates that consumer trust propensity operates as a vital moderator, particularly affecting how two key dimensions of online reviews—review valence and quality—influence perceived risk. This moderating effect manifests as a mechanism that introduces a mitigating influence to a certain extent.},

Existing recommendation models often cannot handle complex user-item interaction networks and are difficult to fully explore the deep connection between user preferences and books. To address this problem, the study proposes a novel intelligent recommendation model that uniquely integrates the structural representation ability of Graph Neural Networks with the dynamic feature extraction ability of attention mechanisms. This innovative combination enables the simultaneous capture of complex user-item topological relationships and adaptive importance weighting of heterogeneous features, which has not been extensively explored in library recommendation systems. The model uses a multi-head attention mechanism for adaptive feature selection and combines residual connections to ensure the effective flow of information in the deep network. Experimental results show that on the Amazon book dataset, the proposed fusion model outperforms traditional deep learning methods and improves the recommendation accuracy by more than 15%. In the actual deployment of a university library, the recommendation coverage of the fusion model reached 89.2%, the user satisfaction score was 4.52 points (out of 5 points), and the recommendation accuracy in multiple subject areas remained above 85%. These results show that the fusion model effectively reveals deep relationships, solves the challenges of modeling dynamic user interests and diverse book features, and provides reliable technical support for the intelligent and personalized reading recommendation system of modern libraries.},

  abstract = {With the speedy prosperity of artificial intelligence and sensor technology, the application of action recognition in football is becoming increasingly widespread. However, due to the rapid changes, complex dynamics, and diverse characteristics of football movements, traditional recognition methods face significant challenges in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Based on this background, a football recognition model combining network wearable sensors and improved support vector machine classification algorithm is proposed. Firstly, by integrating the attitude data of accelerometers and gyroscopes, real-time dynamic features such as pitch angle, roll angle, and yaw angle are calculated, and principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction processing. Subsequently, the support vector machine model is optimized based on Gaussian kernel function and dynamic weighting strategy to improve classification accuracy and stability. Finally, a football action recognition model is constructed by combining wearable sensors with an improved support vector machine classification algorithm. The experiment outcomes show that the improved support vector machine algorithm achieves an action recognition accuracy of 93.8%, a recall rate of 92.5%, an F1 value of 0.92, and an inference time of 10.2 ms, which are significantly better than the comparative algorithm. In practical applications, the recognition model built has an accuracy rate of over 90% in recognizing four types of actions: standing, running, passing, and shooting, with an average recognition time as low as 9.4 ms. The research provides an efficient solution for intelligent football action recognition technology and lays the foundation for the practical application of multi-modal data fusion.},

By designing and combining elements such as clothing styles, colors, and image styles, fashion works with unique styles and practical functions are created. However, the existing clothing design methods all have defects such as poor image accuracy and long generation cycle. Therefore, this study optimizes the Cycle Consistency-Generative Adversarial Network by introducing Least Squares and Efficient Channel Attention Network, and constructs a brand-new intelligent fashion design image generation model based on this. The results show that this model achieves an accuracy of 97.1%, an average success rate of 96.8%, and a 37 dB image signal-to-noise ratio, significantly outperforming the comparison models. Meanwhile, when generating a substantial volume of clothing designs, the model maintained a peak response time of merely 229 ms and a minimal loss rate of 0.17%. And it achieved a score of 97.3 in a questionnaire based on the esthetic ratings of 200 users. In conclusion, the proposed model not only generates higher-quality, more detailed images but also ensures high precision and success rates. The clothing designs are widely accepted by the public, meet modern esthetic standards, and effectively address the challenges of existing fashion design methods, and is conducive to designing higher-quality fashion garments.},

  abstract = {As the earliest form of writing and historical cultural heritage in China, oracle bone inscriptions carry immeasurable density of historical information and potential for academic research. However, due to the age and preservation environment, the quality of many oracle bone images is severely impaired, resulting in problems such as text edge wear, loss of details, and blurred handwriting, which greatly limits the ability of scholars to accurately interpret the contents of the oracle bones and explore them in depth. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image enhancement and calibration system, which realizes multi-level information recovery and geometric correction from micro to macro by applying an advanced deep learning model to capture the minute features, delicate textures and original layouts of oracle bone images. The model in this paper consists of two main parts, that is, generator network G and discriminator network D. The task of generator G is to generate images consistent with the real data distribution based on random noise variables and possibly additional condition information (e.g., category labels, attributes, etc.), which should mimic or satisfy as much as possible the features of the real image under the given conditions. The discriminator D, on the other hand, is responsible for receiving the input real image or the fake image generated by the generator and outputs a probability value that reflects the probability that it considers the image to be a real sample, that is, the truthfulness or trustworthiness of the image. The model in this paper achieves the functions of image quality assessment and authenticity judgment, image recovery and optimization, image enhancement and proofreading by means of adversarial training. Experimental evaluations are carried out on two representative oracle image datasets, OBI-100 and OBI-300, and the effectiveness and superiority of this paper’s method in improving the clarity and readability of oracle images, as well as accurately recognizing oracle characters and extracting oracle information, are verified by comparing it with other image enhancement and reweighting methods. The effectiveness and superiority of the method is verified. The method of this paper provides a new technical means for the research and inheritance of oracle bone inscriptions.},

MSE can be expressed mathematically in terms of controllable parameters Weight on Bit (WOB), Rate of Penetration (ROP), Revolutions per Minute (RPM) etc. Once the optimum WOB was determined, the correlation with Torque and Penetration per Revolution was used to determine optimum values for those parameters for a given drilling situation. The MSE surveillance systerm provides the ability to detect changes in the efficiency of the drilling system, more or less continuously. The use of MSE surveillance is a key feature of well planning and operational practice, MSE analysis has resulted in redesigned in areas as diverse as well control practices, bit selection, BHA and ECD design, makeup torque, directional target sizing, and motor differential ratings.

  abstract = {In recent years, the task of generating captions for videos has become a prominent research focus, with its main challenge being how to effectively capture essential semantic elements – such as objects, actions, and their spatial-temporal relationships – from abundant and redundant visual content. To address this challenge, earlier methods generally concentrate on either extracting representative clips across multiple frames (global level) or locating salient areas within single frames (local level). Many existing methods tend to ignore the fundamental hierarchical organization of videos, where identifying representative frames should come before locating informative regions. To tackle this limitation, we propose G2L, a hierarchical attention framework that (1) selects salient clips &amp; frames via differentiable Gumbel Top-K sampling and (2) refines region-level context for caption generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely adopted benchmarks MSVD and MSR-VTT confirm that our method achieves notable improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablations confirm that the global-to-local cascade and dual-branch optimization jointly account for the gain.},

  abstract = {In power distribution networks, the correct identification of network topology and parameters is critical in maintaining efficient operating conditions. Operative efficiency and reliability are major goals in such networks. Satisfying these conditions necessitates a clear understanding of network parameters and topology, particularly in low-voltage power distribution networks, which are typically characterized by complicated patterns and fluctuating load demands. This research presents a novel approach utilizing the Voltage Regulator Weighted Topology Recurrent Neural Network (VR-WT-RNN) for joint identification of parameters and topology in low-voltage distribution networks. The Low-Voltage Network Dataset is used to capture time-series data from five nodes in a low-voltage electrical distribution network, and Z-score normalization was used for data preprocessing. The VR-WT-RNN approach combines weighted topology considerations within a recurrent neural network structure, enhancing its ability to accurately model and predict sophisticated network behaviors. Using records of voltage regulator settings, load profiles, and network configurations, the model can predict both network parameters and topology. The performance of the VR-WT-RNN model shows an effectiveness of up to 5% accuracy improvement for Transformer 2, accompanied by significant gains in NMI and ARI over traditional methods. Further, the responsiveness of the model towards dynamic variations of network conditions marks its usability within changing operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Multimodal sentiment analysis is a well-known field in AI that integrates text, video, and audio to gain a better understanding of people’s emotions. However, this field still faces two major challenges: first, it is difficult to effectively eliminate noise interference in multimodal data; Second, the existing research focuses on the fusion mechanism between modes, ignoring the similarity and heterogeneity between modes, which leads to the deviation of emotional analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep fusion model based on Transformer. We define the polarity vector (PV) and the intensity vector (SV) based on the emotion analysis strategy of PS-Mixer to judge the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) and intensity (0–3 range) of emotions, respectively. PV fuses text and video features, and SV fuses text and audio features and improves the ability of feature expression by introducing a cross-fusion strategy. Transformer architecture enhances the generalization performance and large-scale data processing ability of the model. The experimental results show that the performance of this model on MOSI and MOSEI datasets is better than the existing multi-modal sentiment analysis methods, which provides a new idea for research in this field.},

  abstract = {Accurate medical image segmentation models can efficiently assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis. Segmentation methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in extracting local features. However, due to their inherently limited receptive fields, they exhibit shortcomings in integrating global dependencies and extracting multi-scale features. This limitation of CNNs has prompted researchers to explore Transformer-based approaches. This shift is driven by the unique self-attention mechanism of Transformers, which effectively models global dependencies and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. In this study, we designed a medical image segmentation model called FRISFormer, based on a U-shaped architecture. FRISFormer is entirely built on the Transformer architecture and possesses the characteristic of being effectively trainable without the need for pre-trained models. Specifically, the innovation of FRISFormer is primarily reflected in two key aspects: (1) FRISFormer refines the features extracted by the Efficient Self-Attention (ESA) module through a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN), further achieving deep deconstruction and enhancement of features. (2) FRISFormer replaces the classic skip connections with a ReMixed Transformer Context Bridge, effectively promoting the correlation between global dependencies and local context. This study tested FRISFormer on the multi-organ segmentation dataset (Synapse) and the skin lesion segmentation dataset (ISIC 2018). On the Synapse dataset, FRISFormer improved the test metric by 0.50, while on the ISIC dataset, the test metric improved by 0.23. The experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FRISFormer in feature representation and segmentation accuracy.},

  abstract = {The fractional order accumulation calculation process in traditional grey system theory is too complex and has poor effectiveness in predicting carbon dioxide emissions in practical applications. A new non-equidistant grey model is proposed to address the above issues, which introduces a C-type fractional order cumulative derivative to simplify the calculation of fractional order accumulation. At the same time, introducing a dynamic fractional order adjustment strategy can adaptively optimize the fractional order value based on data characteristics, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the model in predicting carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the C-type fractional order cumulative non-uniform grey model (1,1) is obtained. The research results show that compared with existing advanced non-equidistant GM (1,1) models based on integration, non-equidistant grey prediction models based on residual correction, and hybrid multi-scale machine learning models, the research method achieves higher accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency. Its average absolute percentage error in performance testing is the lowest at only 1.987%, significantly better than other models. In practical applications, the research method has an average absolute percentage error of less than 10% in both foreign and domestic data prediction. Overall, this model can be applied in practical prediction of carbon dioxide emissions and provide data reference for achieving the goal of “carbon neutrality.”},

A survey of 1453 rural residents in Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces in central China showed that residents’ belief in official media coverage affecting vaccination behavior was established, while entertainment network platforms hindered the dissemination of health knowledge due to excessive entertainment information. In addition, perceived effectiveness, perceived security, perceived hazard, and knowledge related to vaccines can affect vaccination behavior.

  abstract = {With the advancement of technology, the inclusion problem of piezoelectric materials has gradually become a key research object. The aim of this study is to solve the relative rigid body displacement of Eshelby inclusion in piezoelectric materials. An improved Eshelby boundary element method is proposed, which combines the displacement extrapolation method to accurately calculate the mechanical properties of piezoelectric materials by introducing a strength factor. The improved method not only improves the calculation accuracy, but also effectively deals with the relative displacement of inclusions in piezoelectric materials. In the experiment, gallium arsenide is taken as an object, and the effectiveness of the improved method is verified by comparing J-integral method with stress method. The experimental results show that when the intensity factor is 1, 2, and 3, the error rates of generalized displacement calculation are 0.67%, 0.46%, and 0.39%, respectively. The errors of this method are 0.15%, 0.12%, 0.16%, 0.14%, and 0.16%, respectively, when measuring the relative displacement of inclusions and rigid bodies. These results show that the Eshelby boundary element method improved by displacement extrapolation has significant advantages in the treatment of boundary conditions and displacement analysis of piezoelectric materials. The improved method can effectively solve the problem of relative displacement of inclusions in piezoelectric materials, and has wide application prospect and high practical value.},

            century education, creativity is widely regarded as one of the essential qualities that students must possess. With the increasing demand for personalized teaching, accurately measuring students’ creativity and effectively enhancing it has become a focal point of current educational research. Traditional methods of educational assessment fall short in terms of personalized recommendations and long-term effect evaluation, failing to meet the needs of modern education. In contrast, the potential exhibited by artificial intelligence technologies, especially neural networks in data processing and behavioral analysis, offers new possibilities for addressing these issues. The efficiency and flexibility of Graph Attention Networks (GANs) in handling complex relational data, in particular, provide novel tools for the scientific measurement and enhancement of creativity. However, existing research is insufficient in exploring the impact of group interactions on creativity and assessing the long-term effects of personalized educational interventions. This study initially utilizes GANs to establish an innovative model for group activity recommendation, aimed at analyzing students’ personality traits and levels of creativity to recommend activities best suited for unleashing their creative potential. Subsequently, a weighted network approach is employed to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of creative enhancement following participation in recommended activities, examining the impact of various educational intervention strategies. This research not only extends the application of neural networks in the field of education but also offers new methodological support for personalized teaching, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for optimizing educational resource allocation and enhancing educational quality.},

Traditional protection methods are difficult to adapt to the complex and changeable ecological environment, and innovative technical means are urgently needed. This study aims to integrate the Internet of Things and deep reinforcement learning technology to build a forest ecological protection strategy optimization and decision support system to improve protection efficiency and scientificity. A comprehensive perception of forest ecology is achieved by deploying sensoreal times to monitor forest environmental parameters in real life, such as temperature, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, a protection strategy optimization model is established, and the optimal strategy is learned by simulating the protection measures in different situations. Experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, this system can improve the effectiveness of the protection strategy by 30% and significantly reduce the waste of resources. In the simulated 1000-hectare forest area, after adopting this system, the vegetation coverage rate increased by 20%, and the species diversity index increased by 15%. In addition, the system also has a real-time decision support function, which can dynamically adjust protection strategies according to real-time data to respond to sudden environmental changes.

  abstract = {With the emergence of new network services, they have put forward extremely high quality of service requirements for transmission links. A high-performance priority queue scheduling mechanism driven by artificial intelligence is proposed to address the low efficiency and easy blocking of traditional priority queue scheduling mechanisms in software defined network data planes. This mechanism avoids queue head blocking by improving the deficit round robin algorithm, ensures fair allocation of output bandwidth for differentiated fine-grained priority queues, and guarantees maximum forwarding delay. The results show that this method significantly improves performance compared to traditional algorithms, as it can process and forward data packets faster, thereby reducing latency and increasing throughput. Specifically, the average round-trip time of the deficit round robin algorithm is 8.21 ms, compared to 3.89 ms for this method, which reduces 4.72 ms. The highest average throughput of the deficit round robin algorithm is 60.01 Mbps, compared to 105.99 Mbps for this method, which improves by 76.62%. After improving the algorithm, the software defined a network data plane system with an average frame delay of 2.81 ms and a packet loss rate of 4.50%. The amount of data transmitted by the improved system was basically the same as when it was not attacked, with an availability rate of 98.6%. The improved algorithm can better ensure the smoothness of transmission services. This provides a new direction for future research on new network architecture technologies and has certain economic value.},

The model classified the course reviews from two aspects of sentiment and content. The sentiment aspect was divided into three categories of “Positive,” “Negative,” and “Neutral,” and the content aspect was divided into three categories of “course,” “platform environment,” and “other.” In the collection and processing of data sets, an effective data set that accurately represents the characteristics of the education field is constructed by utilizing comments obtained from the NetEase Cloud course platform. The HuggingFace open source Bert pre-training model is then employed for word vector training. In the model construction, based on the Voting and BiLSTM model classification algorithm, a weighted fusion Bi_Voting strategy is proposed, and the classification principle based on SVM and the resampling enhance module are introduced. The experimental results show that the classification model has significant advantages in terms of accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value.

The proposed architecture consists of three key components: a temporal pyramid multi-scale convolutional module to extract hierarchical periodic features across hourly, daily, and weekly levels; a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) module to capture global temporal de-pendencies in both forward and backward directions; and an attention mechanism to dynamically emphasize critical time steps. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world power consumption datasets demonstrate that TPA-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons (1-h, 6-h, and 24-h), achieving significant improvements in RMSE, MAPE, and R

  abstract = {Purpose:
            To present our approach to zygomatic osteotomy and repositioning using technological aids: virtual surgical planning, custom guides, and implants.
            Background:
            The zygomatic complex is highly 3-dimensional, establishing cheek prominence, facial width, and orbital morphology. Functionally, the zygoma supports soft tissues and is vital to mastication. The zygoma may require reconstruction after a variety of congenital or acquired conditions; however, Zygomatic Osteotomy and Repositioning (ZyOaR) is a complex operation with many technical considerations. The advent of virtual surgical planning (VSP) has enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility, while permitting utilization of custom-designed guides and implants. There remains a paucity of literature on ZyOaR and its unique challenges.
            Methods:
            This case series includes all patients older than 18 years old undergoing ZyOaR with VSP between 2010 and 2024. Demographics and clinical etiology were noted. Outcomes included fidelity to preoperative plan, facial symmetry, mastication defects, and globe malposition.
            Results:
            Eight patients age 18 to 60 years old (mean = 38) met inclusion criteria. Three patients had congenital deformities, and 5 were post-traumatic. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 50 months (mean = 17 months). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patient had visual changes at latest follow-up. Preoperative VSP plans were compared to postoperative CT scans, showing a high degree of fidelity. All patients underwent secondary reconstructive and/or soft tissue procedures to achieve final results.
            Conclusions:
            Zygomatic Osteotomy and Repositioning (ZyOaR) is inherently difficult, and there is a current gap in the literature on its unique technical challenges. We present 8 cases of ZyOaR using VSP for patients with a range of disease etiologies. The procedures were well tolerated and maintained high surgical fidelity. In our experience, keys to optimize ZyOaR include comprehensive analysis of regional bony and soft tissue anatomy, virtual planning with production and use of surgical transfer guides, and custom 3D printed patient-specific implants.},

This study examines the influence of resource conflict, visual angle separation, and task priority on dual-task interference. Data was collected from 39 participants performing a visual tracking task and a digit task in virtual reality (VR). Using Multiple Resource Theory’s (MRT) computational model, an iterative approach was employed to evaluate each factor’s contribution. Incorporating resource conflict improved model fit over a demand-only baseline, and adding a visual penalty to account for angle separation further enhanced prediction accuracy. Task-specific results showed greater interference in the digit task, suggesting that task priority influences susceptibility to interference. Overall, the results highlight the importance of incorporating resource conflict and perceptual factors, such as visual angle separation, into computational models of dual-task interference.},

It combines time-frequency domain features and brain network topological features to divide electroencephalogram signals into different frequency bands and length epochs. This allows for the analysis of characteristic values of electroencephalogram signals of schizophrenic patients. Through comparative trials, the study evaluates the suggested model’s performance. The results revealed that the proposed model obtained an average accuracy of 91.12% using the phase-locked value functional connectivity metric at Theta frequency band and 6-s segment length, which was 2.85%, 8.74%, and 3.95% higher compared to the support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and temporal convolutional network models, respectively, and demonstrated a superior recognition performance. In addition, network topology analysis revealed that the parietal region was an important region in the brain network of schizophrenic patients. The proposed model is reliable and feasible for detecting schizophrenic patients. It can extract topological features from electroencephalogram signals to characterize the functional brain networks of patients with schizophrenia. These features can then be correlated with clinical symptom salience, which is expected to aid in diagnosis.},

However, the previous literature has not systematically explored the factors that cause AI ethics and law in English language teaching, nor has it made suggestions to address these factors. Therefore, this paper explores in depth the origins, manifestations, and solutions of these ethical and legal issues. Firstly, through the literature review method, we explore the ethical and legal issues surrounding AI in English language teaching and its impact on teachers and students, and find that these ethical and legal issues have a significant effect on enhancing the legal awareness of students and teachers. Moreover, based on the literature review method, this paper identifies eight influencing factors and determines the weights of each factor through the method of multiple linear regression, and it can be seen that automated decision-making and accountability (X3) and teacher roles and competence (X4) have the greatest weights and are the key factors leading to ethical and legal issues. Finally, this paper also formulates targeted recommendations in response to the experimental results, such as respecting students’ and teachers’ privacy and autonomy, maintaining teachers’ professionalism and accountability, and complying with laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines.},

This relatively low accuracy is partly attributed to the Iris dataset’s inherent complexity, including class overlap and subtle feature differences between clusters. It also indicates potential for further optimization, such as refining the distance measurement method for overlapping classes. The experimental evaluation shows that on the Iris and Wine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the clustering accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 37.13% and 41.22%, respectively. Compared with the traditional K-Means algorithm, its convergence speed is increased by 4.5 times, where convergence speed is measured by both the number of iterations required to reach stable clustering results and the computational time.},

  abstract = {Virtual simulation of surveying instruments is a specific aspect of virtual measurement that combines three technologies: three-dimensional (3D) modeling, virtual simulation, and computer technology. In order to solve problems such as instrument damage, shortage of practical instruments for students, and difficulties in practical training, this paper takes the level instrument in surveying instruments as an example, and uses virtual reality simulation technology, Unity3D technology, 3ds Max modeling technology, and related computer technologies to build a virtual simulation of the level instrument. The research mainly focuses on the following aspects: (1) Using 3ds Max software, the tripod model was established, and the telescope model, objective lens model, spiral model, and base model of the level instrument were also established, and then combined into a complete level instrument. Finally, the tripod model and the level instrument model were imported into Unity3D for assembly and use. (2) Using C# programming language, SQL Server database, and Unity3D, a virtual terrain was built to simulate the cognitive simulation of the level instrument, the principle of centering and leveling simulation, and the principle of height measurement simulation. (3) The cognitive simulation of the level instrument was carried out in the Unity3D-based surveying instrument cognitive simulation system; the simulation of the principle of level instrument height measurement was also performed. Through the reading of the level staff, the elevation was calculated. This virtual simulation system can be used for classroom teaching demonstrations and student experiments, effectively reducing the damage of expensive surveying instruments, easing equipment shortages, and improving teaching effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) is a key competency for cultivating innovation in science and technology. However, its influencing pathways remain unclear. This study integrates structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explore how individual and environmental factors such as parental engagement, family atmosphere, scientific critical and judgmental ability, learning engagement, extracurricular reading, and teaching methods shape junior high school students’ S-HOT. Based on data from 124 students in Beijing, the findings show that scientific critical and judgmental ability positively affects S-HOT. Extracurricular reading enhances S-HOT indirectly through learning engagement or in combination with scientific critical and judgmental ability. However, excessive learning engagement may have a negative impact. fsQCA reveals six distinct factor combinations that contribute to S-HOT, highlighting the presence of multiple effective pathways. These findings offer both theoretical insight and practical guidance for the targeted development of higher-order thinking in science education.},

  abstract = {As society evolves, people have become increasingly reliant on the internet, and network access control technologies ensure the security of network environments. However, traditional network access control technologies generally suffer from limitations such as static verification cycles, single authorization methods, and a lack of continuous behavior tracking, making it difficult to address dynamic and complex network threats. To address this, the study proposes a network access control model based on the zero-trust security concept, integrating dynamic authorization verification methods to keep user verification in a continuous and dynamic state, thereby enhancing the system’s overall protective capabilities. Through simulation experiments, the results show that compared to KNN, SVM, and MLP models, the proposed ZT-DA model achieves an accuracy rate of 98.4% and a false positive rate of 3.8% when accessing 400 times, with clearer classification boundaries, enabling more accurate distinction between normal and abnormal behavior. When the sample size is 200, the trust calculation times for different stages are 78 ms, 65 ms, and 70 ms, respectively. In practical applications, the model achieved an interception rate of 100%, a false interception rate of 0%, and a control range of 100%. The research results indicate that the model can monitor threat behaviors in real time, effectively intercept malicious attacks, and enhance information security protection capabilities with a lower false positive rate while ensuring a smooth user network experience.},

In this article, we explore this proposition by drawing on interconnected and entangled moments of children’s outdoor storied play in a Canadian first-grade class. By mapping the children’s movements within three storied-play encounters, we animate how what could appear as the most ordinary and mundane ways of composing story in outdoor, open-ended and make-believe play, offers a lively form of protestation to the predominant Western narrative paradigm of beginning-middle-end story structure. Bringing the three moments into conversation with literary theorist Marielle Macé’s concept of narrative stylization, we attend to ways story lives and grows within children’s storied and playful worldbuilding. Ultimately, we argue that limiting instructional methods to that which is centred around the objectification and rationalization of storying (i.e., typical beginning-middle-end story structure) can displace other pedagogical directions that recognize and extend the myriad ways in which stories are made, learned, and understood. We conclude the article with an exploration of how educators might promote and build upon the narrative stylizations – fiction-in-the-doing – that children are always already engaging in their storied play.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the information age, traditional resume screening methods have been difficult to meet the urgent needs of enterprises for efficient and accurate talent selection when dealing with massive recruitment data. Based on this, this study proposes a resume screening and career matching model based on Fuzzy Natural Language Processing (Fuzzy NLP), which aims to optimize the intelligent matching process between talents and positions by using cutting-edge technology. The model deeply integrates fuzzy logic theory and semantic analysis technology, and constructs a multi-dimensional semantic understanding framework to refine the analysis of resumes and job descriptions, effectively eliminate the semantic ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language, and break through the bottleneck of traditional methods at the level of semantic understanding. In the empirical research phase, the research team systematically tested a real-world dataset of 5000 resumes and 1000 job information. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional keyword matching method, the proposed model achieves a significant improvement of 25% to 85% in the matching accuracy, and accurately captures the potential relationship between job requirements and candidates’ abilities through dynamic weight adjustment and semantic similarity measurement mechanism. In terms of screening efficiency, the model helps optimize the recruitment process, shortens the manual review time by 30%, and significantly reduces labor and time costs. Especially when dealing with fuzzy semantic descriptions and polysemy word scenarios, the model reduces the false positive rate by 20% through context perception and fuzzy rule reasoning, showing excellent semantic understanding ability and robustness. This study not only verifies the practical value and technical advantages of fuzzy natural language processing technology in the field of human resource management but also provides theoretical support and methodological reference for promoting the intelligent transformation of the recruitment process, which is expected to build a more efficient and accurate talent screening system for enterprises and help human resource management move towards a new stage of intelligent and scientific development.},

To address these challenges, this study introduces a blockchain-based approach combined with the RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm, which enables secure decryption without direct key transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly reduces the communication overhead compared to that of existing dual-layer consensus and IoT-based architectures. With 40 nodes, it achieves just 302 transactions of overhead at 50 TPS and a minimal system memory usage of 0.502% at 40 TPS. Furthermore, at a high throughput of 120 TPS, the algorithm completes transactions in only 53.47 ms—far faster than competing methods. These improvements enhance both security and efficiency, offering a more reliable framework for e-commerce transactions and logistics data sharing while strengthening trust in digital trade.},

However, the current methods for analyzing and predicting the trend of infectious disease transmission are not comprehensive, resulting in significant discrepancies in the analysis results. To address this issue, a differential equation model of infectious diseases with latent periods is proposed for Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible. On this basis, a staged model combined with logistic regression is established. Finally, in response to the problem of missing data related to infectious diseases in certain regions, LSTM networks and autoregressive integrated moving average models are used for prediction to assist differential equation models in disease transmission analysis. Through empirical analysis, it is known that the fitting degree between the results obtained from the infectious disease differential equation model proposed in the study and the actual results reaches 0.95, with a root mean square error of 0.03 and an average relative error of 3.5%.

  abstract = {While natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in high-resource languages (HRLs), many languages still lack sufficient representation in training data. Many more such languages remain underrepresented in training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning (CTLT) has been proposed as an exciting use case where an application of these text classifiers trained on HRLs will be extended to low-resource languages (LRLs), mostly using zero and few-shot techniques. This notwithstanding, conventional multilingual language models usually underperform in some languages. Using classification along with language modeling does not work for all language combinations for optimal results. The approach that we propose is MT-TC: a new hybrid framework upon which the traditional translate-test approach can be revisited and refined. That is, MT-TC combines a text classifier trained in the high-resource language with a neural machine translation (NMT) model. Because it enjoys “soft” differentiable translations, backpropagation can be performed end-to-end on an architecture to jointly fine-tune both components. We evaluate MT-TC on Taxi1500 dataset with 20 typologically diverse languages. The macro F1-score reaches 0.88 for the proposed method, outperforming baseline multilingual models by as much as 12.5% in low-resource settings. These results show that under the aspect of minimum-annotated data availability, MT-TC performs significantly well and qualifies itself as a very within-real-world-scalable solution for a lot of multilingual NLP applications.},

The quality of music instruction is not scientifically and reasonably evaluated based on actual teaching quality. When it comes to teaching and evaluating music, music teachers simply follow the classroom teaching evaluation indicators and models of any other topic in the school. An evaluation system that is merely a form, and does not have any meaningful impact on evaluation, feedback, or promotion is inevitable as a result of this. That’s why a deep-level, in-depth study of music classroom teaching’s quality evaluation system is still needed, along with a theoretical-and-practical combination. This work takes the music teaching as the starting point to carry out the corresponding research. First, this work builds a music teaching quality evaluation system via B/S architecture. It includes three parts: client, application unit, and database. The application unit includes user management, online evaluation, data management, evaluation result query and analysis. After users enter the system, they will score the teaching quality. Second, this work proposes the use of multi-scale convolution to extract data features, and proposes an improved attention mechanism to construct MS-IATT-CNN for evaluating music teaching quality.

  abstract = {As aerobics becomes an increasingly popular form of exercise, the demand for precise movement standards has grown. Traditional human pose recognition models no longer meet the practical requirements of aerobics scenarios. To address this, the study is based on open pose estimation technology, optimized with attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, and proposes a hybrid human pose recognition model. Performance validation and ablation experiments show that the model have an accuracy of 95% and a loss value as low as 0.0089. The highest score for human key points is 7.5, with angle error and position error reduced to 4.9% and 5.4%, respectively, outperforming the base algorithm. This highlights the success of the proposed optimization and enhancement techniques. In practical application comparison experiments, the recognition model achieves a running time of 8 ms when recognizing 150 images, significantly outperforming the comparison models. In multi-person recognition experiments, the proposed model reaches an accuracy of 93%. Additionally, the model shows superior performance in visualizing human pose recognition in practical scenarios. These results indicate that the model has high recognition accuracy and robustness, and can adapt to various real-world applications, meeting the high demands for human pose recognition in aerobics.},

WI-FI has brought many positive changes to the lifestyle of college students, and has also had many negative effects on college students. Under the WI-FI environment, college students’ health is worrying. The number of “head-downers” on campus has increased sharply, and the phenomenon of dependence on the WI-FI has become more and more serious, which seriously endangers the health of students. In view of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis in the WI-FI environment, hoping to understand its specific impact and propose effective solutions based on its existing problems. By analyzing the impact of WI-FI environment on college students’ physical and mental health, find out the specific types of morbidity caused by WI-FI environment on college students’ physical and mental health. The data of a college student group in a university are collected to establish a judgment model and recognition model based on deep learning. The model integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and machine learning algorithms to comprehensively assess the health status of college students.

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has swept into design research and practice, with popular image generators and language model interfaces now being used across disciplines and design stages. The multimodal language models exhibit fundamentally different characteristics from earlier machine learning approaches, and present unique challenges and opportunities for designers. A key question for design research arises: How can the capabilities of these large multimodal models become part of our design tools? This work investigates how the recent development of reasoning language models in particular can be utilized for early stage exploratory design. We outline a set of principles to build effective tools with these models by drawing from research in artificial intelligence. Specifically, we explore the application of the new reasoning model paradigm in computational design scripting. We present a system which successfully generates computer-aided design (CAD) scripts in Grasshopper. The system is compared to existing CAD AI approaches for its capabilities and characteristics. High latency and the absence of a user-model feedback loop still restrict real-time exploration in our system. Our developed principles can further inform broad exploratory tools and motivate inquiries into multimodal reasoning for design. By demonstrating a new CAD approach, we show large models’ utility as creative tools. Future research should address latency, enhance interactivity, and address other design tasks beyond CAD.},

  abstract = {As the world transitions toward a more sustainable and digitalized energy landscape, the management of grid assets has become increasingly complex and critical to ensuring the efficient delivery of electricity. The integration of renewable energy systems (RES) with grid-connected load infrastructures has proven to be an effective solution for enhancing system reliability and reducing transmission losses. However, this integration often introduces power quality (PQ) issues, such as voltage sags, swells, and fluctuations, which can compromise grid stability. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel solution for sustainable digital grid asset management using the Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) and Weighted Salp Swarm Driven One-Class Support Vector Machine (WSS-OCSVM), which integrates the Weighted Salp Swarm Algorithm (WSSA) with Weighted One-Class Support Vector Machine (WOCSVM). The approach aims to mitigate PQ disturbances, optimize asset disposal strategies, and evaluate the ecological impact of grid components. The methodology is implemented in several stages: first, the UPQC is used to regulate power quality, followed by the integration of WSS-OCSVM to optimize decision-making processes for asset management. This system is further enhanced by the SEASWARM platform, which enables intelligent adaptation and decision-making for asset disposal, considering environmental factors like carbon emissions and recyclability. The efficacy of the suggested method is confirmed by MATLAB simulation studies, which show better performance than existing techniques. Although evaluated on the 39-bus system, the suggested UPQC + WSS-OCSVM approach produced results of 99.94% accuracy. The results indicate that the UPQC + WSS-OCSVM model moderates PQ disturbances and also optimizes asset lifecycle management and promotes ecological sustainability. This comprehensive solution offers a significant advancement in the development of intelligent, resilient, and environmentally conscious modern power grids.},

However, the existing teaching feedback mechanism is often single and lagging, and it is not easy to comprehensively and in real time reflect the teaching effect and students’ learning status. Therefore, this study aims to explore how virtual simulation technology can optimize the multi-level feedback mechanism in the information teaching of vocational colleges to realize the precise regulation and personalized guidance of the teaching process. Vocational colleges pay attention to cultivating practical skills, and virtual simulation technology can provide a working environment close to accurate, effectively making up for the shortcomings of traditional teaching. However, the lack of adequate feedback mechanism makes it difficult to maximize the teaching effect. This study constructed a multi-level feedback system based on virtual simulation technology, including three levels: real-time interactive feedback, phased evaluation feedback and comprehensive analysis feedback. In the experiment, we selected 1000 students and 50 teachers from three vocational colleges as the research objects and carried out a one-semester teaching practice. The experimental results show that after the introduction of a multi-level feedback mechanism, students’ academic performance has improved by 20% on average, their practical skills have improved by 25%, and their learning satisfaction has reached 90%. At the same time, teachers’ teaching efficiency has increased by 15%, and their teaching satisfaction has reached 95%. In addition, the accuracy rate of real-time feedback of the system reaches 88%, the accuracy rate of phased evaluation reaches 92%, and the accuracy rate of comprehensive analysis reaches 95%.

This research introduces a novel hybrid model, Logistic Regression-Weighted Random Forest (LR-WRF), combining the benefits of Logistic Regression (LR) and Weighted Random Forest (WRF) to automate asset classification and disposal predictions. The system collects historical data, including asset ID, location, usage history, maintenance logs, and physical condition, which are pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and normalise formats. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for feature extraction, reducing data dimensionality while retaining essential information. A Weighted Random Forest (WRF) classifier is then used to categorise assets into operational states such as Active, Degraded, or Obsolete. To predict disposal eligibility, a Logistic Regression model assesses whether an asset should be retained, sold, recycled, or discarded. The experimental results show that the LR-WRF model provides high classification accuracy and offers effective disposal recommendations, significantly reducing manual intervention and ensuring compliance with asset lifecycle policies. The proposed model was evaluated across a variety of metrics, including accuracy (98.82%), precision, recall, and F1-score.

English learning is an integral part of education, and its learning behavior analysis and teaching optimization have attracted much attention. Based on the SSA-GRU (Singular Spectrum Analysis-Gated Recurrent Unit) model, this study aims to deeply explore characteristics of English learning behavior to provide a scientific basis for teaching optimization. Firstly, a comprehensive learning behavior database is constructed by collecting online learning data of English learners, including learning time, interaction frequency, and homework completion. Subsequently, the SSA-GRU model is used to mine the data deeply, and the potential laws and trends in learning behavior are effectively extracted. The experimental results show that compared with traditional analysis methods, the SSA-GRU model improves the accuracy of behavioral pattern recognition by 15.3% and trend prediction by 12.7%. Further analysis shows that learners’ learning time is positively correlated with their achievements (the correlation coefficient is 0.78), and the influence of interaction frequency on the learning effect is particularly significant (the improvement effect is 18.4%). This study proposes targeted teaching optimization strategies based on these analysis results, including personalized learning path recommendations and interactive teaching activity design. Practical application shows that these strategies have effectively improved the teaching effect, with students’ achievement increasing by 10.2% on average and learning satisfaction rising by 22.5%.

This study aims to explore how national political forces affect the spatial distribution and resource allocation of urban and rural areas through policy intervention. The research background covers the complexity of urban and rural development under globalization and the guiding role of national policies in regional development. By constructing a comprehensive analysis model, it is found that the adjustment coefficient of national policies on urban and rural population distribution reaches 0.75, which significantly promotes the urbanization process. Regarding resource allocation, policy intervention has narrowed the difference in resource allocation between urban and rural areas by 20%, effectively alleviating the problem of resource inequality. In addition, the regional development pattern optimization index has increased by 30% under the guidance of policies, indicating the important role of national political forces in optimizing spatial structure and promoting the integrated development of urban and rural areas.

  abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, Power Marketing Management Platforms (PMMPs) have emerged as essential tools for businesses seeking to optimize their marketing strategies. These platforms integrate advanced technologies and data analytics to deliver targeted campaigns, automate processes, and generate valuable insights into customer behavior. However, traditional marketing approaches often face challenges such as data silos, poor cross-channel integration, and a limited ability to adapt to shifting consumer behaviors. This research investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance electricity consumption analysis and user engagement within PMMPs. A comprehensive framework is proposed, incorporating advanced analytical models for user segmentation, behavioral analysis, and consumption forecasting. The K-Means clustering algorithm segments users based on their electricity consumption patterns, enabling a more tailored service approach. To analyze temporal shifts in user behavior and forecast consumption trends, this research introduces the Dynamic Random Synthesized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (DR-LightGBM). This model delivers actionable insights that support grid scheduling and resource optimization. The system develops personalized marketing strategies, such as dynamic pricing models and energy-saving incentives, to enhance user participation and promote energy conservation. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated using several performance metrics. RMSE (38.11 kW), along with MAPE, MAE, and training time, assess the accuracy of consumption forecasting, while engagement rate and reduction in energy usage serve as business-relevant indicators of marketing impact.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of IoT technology, the nonlinear IoT environment has increasing requirements for the intelligence and resource efficiency of embedded systems. Based on the current background of Internet of Things technology, this study focuses on the design and optimization strategy of intelligent prediction and control algorithms for embedded systems under resource constraints. The proposed algorithm innovatively integrates the long short-term memory network (LSTM) of deep learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO) of reinforcement learning, LSTM processes long-term dependencies in IoT time series data, accurately captures the dynamic changes of the system, and the PPO helps the agent to optimize the control strategy in real time according to the environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, a comprehensive optimization framework combining computing efficiency improvement, storage optimization and energy management is proposed to achieve the best matching of algorithm performance and hardware resources. Experimental data shows that the optimized algorithm performs well in handling nonlinear data prediction tasks, reducing the average computation time by 37%, reducing storage requirements by more than 60%, and reducing energy consumption by 45%. Especially in the nonlinear temperature prediction experiment, the optimization algorithm maintains the same prediction accuracy as the original version, and the response speed is faster and the anti-interference ability is stronger in the face of data peaks, which fully demonstrates the advantages of the algorithm optimization. Compared with the existing methods, the new algorithm overcomes the difficulty of traditional algorithms in dealing with the nonlinear and high-dimensional problems of IoT data in terms of prediction accuracy, and greatly reduces the error. In terms of control performance, it breaks through the limitations of fixed strategies and maintains the efficient and stable operation of the system. It is also highly adaptable and robust. This research fills the gap in the design of intelligent algorithms for embedded systems in the nonlinear Internet of Things environment, and provides strong technical support for enterprises and research institutions to develop the next generation of Internet of Things applications.},

To address this, this study proposes a 3D human animation and motion data generation model that integrates mean shift clustering, graph structure neural network modeling, and Kalman filter prediction. This method achieves adaptive extraction of key bone points through dual-ring neighborhood density clustering, combines local geometry and poses semantics to construct a complete skeleton topology, and introduces a state recursive mechanism for missing point repair and temporal smoothing in the output stage. The experiment showed that the model achieved the highest F1 values of 94.83% and 93.94% on the Human 3.6 M dataset and the Carnegie Mellon University motion capture dataset, with a skeleton point missing rate as low as 6.21%. It maintained an average opinion score of up to 4.78 under multi-view and complex lighting conditions, with an average processing delay of no more than 34 ms. In terms of reconstruction accuracy, acceleration smoothness, and output integrity under extreme poses, this model outperformed other comparison models.

  abstract = {Logistics delivery efficiency and environmental sustainability have become important research areas in the construction of smart cities. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of sustainable logistics and distribution operations in existing smart cities and reduce energy consumption, a multi-objective problem function is constructed for electric vehicle logistics and distribution. Based on the cuckoo algorithm, this study introduces adaptive step size adjustment, bird egg dynamic discovery strategy, and flight reconstruction strategy to optimize the search accuracy and global convergence ability of distribution paths. Finally, a new logistics distribution operation path mechanism is proposed. The new algorithm had an average delivery energy consumption of 149.67 J–160.72 J and a task processing time of 6.32s–8.42s. Compared with the other three advanced planning algorithms, it significantly reduced delivery costs and resource occupation, and improved delivery efficiency by more than 25%. The lowest delivery cost per kilometer was only 1.1 yuan, and the highest delivery efficiency was 40 kilometers per hour.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm with a strategy-guided mechanism and further constructs a path optimization model suitable for multi-destination travel scenarios. This method introduces a safety-aware potential field and a composite reward mechanism to guide the agent to achieve a dynamic balance between path length and safety. In the experimental section, a dataset incorporating map and urban public safety information was constructed, and 800 rounds of path learning simulation experiments were conducted. The results show that the convergence time of the proposed algorithm is 32% shorter than that of the greedy strategy-based method and 27% shorter than that of the policy enhancement method. Additionally, the average path length is reduced by over 100 m, and the safety score improves by over 14%. In multi-destination travel tests, when the number of target points was 20, the total path length was reduced by 3.00% compared to the distance matrix method and by 0.15% compared to the genetic algorithm, verifying its scalability and stability in complex scenarios. The research results indicate that this method can provide efficient, safe, and personalized path planning solutions for urban travelers, offering broad application prospects.},

In the past, the recovery factors for such reservoirs were often predicted through laboratory experiments or numerical simulations, and methods for improving recovery were proposed based on reservoir characteristics.

A neural network-based method for predicting the recovery factors of different blocks is proposed, and the effects of injection volume, timing, concentration, and rate on the recovery factors are analyzed.

At the same time, financial markets are influenced by factors such as market volatility, economic cycles, and unpredictable external shocks, further increasing the complexity of systematic risk modeling and prediction. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity of systemic risk in banks, this study proposes an assessment method for systemic risk in banks based on stochastic differential equations. The results showed that compared with other methods, the model fitting and prediction accuracy of assessing systemic risk in banks based on stochastic differential equations were the highest. When the number of experiments was 1,000, the model fitting degree and prediction accuracy were 0.991 and 96.3%, respectively. The extreme event capture rate and risk premium correlation of evaluating experimental data samples from 30 listed banks using a stochastic differential equation model have been improved. When the number of experiments was 1,000, the extreme event capture rate and risk premium correlation using the SDE model were 93.3% and 0.85. The proposed bank systematic risk assessment method based on stochastic differential equations has superior performance. In real-world banking scenarios, this method captures the dynamic behavior and randomness of the banking system, enabling real-time monitoring and early warning of systemic risks, improving risk management efficiency, and ensuring financial market stability.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the scale of Internet information infrastructure has expanded rapidly, and its threat assessment is becoming more and more important. Assessing the threat of Internet information infrastructure can find out the most vulnerable link in the network node and provide a reference for taking correct network security defense measures. In view of the low accuracy of current Internet information infrastructure threat assessment methods, the study combined relevant data on Internet information infrastructure and constructed a knowledge graph of basic Internet information. This study proposes an Internet infrastructure threat assessment model based on knowledge atlas. In the effectiveness analysis of the model, the most vulnerable network node was Dom5, and it was found that the vulnerability of this node was affected by Dom1, Dom2, Dom3, Dom4, Dom7, and Dom8. Subsequently, in the analysis of the application effect of the model, the average F1 value and average recall rate of the model were 96.13% and 97.26%, respectively, which were better than the comparative model.

  abstract = {The real economy has been seriously hit in recent years, and the government has introduced relevant economic policies to stabilize and promote the development of the real economy. However, the policy uncertainty negatively affects the development of manufacturing enterprises, and the relevant influencing factors need to be analyzed for manufacturing enterprises to achieve long-term stable development. In this study, regression analysis is used to investigate manufacturing enterprises’ technological innovation’ and economic policy uncertainty (EPU)’s connection. Manufacturing enterprises’ innovation activities are negative correlated with EPU and leads to a sustainable lack of technological innovation in enterprises in the results. Meanwhile, in terms of R&amp;D investment and invention patents, EPU has a greater degree of influence on technological innovation of non-state manufacturing enterprises. The proposed methods and viewpoints can provide a scientific research method for measuring the quality of enterprise innovation, that is, using the knowledge breadth method to test the quality of enterprise patents, effectively avoiding the drawbacks of using the number of patents to measure the quality of enterprise innovation.},

  abstract = {This study explores the landscape design of elevated roadside slopes in China’s mountainous cities, aiming to enhance urban environmental aesthetics through an integrated framework of aesthetic and ecological theories. By establishing an aesthetic evaluation system for main road slopes, the research analyzes factors influencing visual landscape quality—including plant configuration, geological conditions, and cultural context—and investigates their correlation with landscape art assessment. Treating mountain slopes as windows for urban civilization, cultural carriers, and ecological nodes, the study addresses the challenge of transforming municipal engineering slopes into symbols of urban humanity. The research integrates 200+ domestic and international literatures, field surveys of 15 main road slopes (over 2 km) in Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming, questionnaires from 300 road users and 50 designers, and 10+ local policy documents. Slopes were selected for geological representativeness, visibility (≤50 m from roads), safety (slope &lt;60°), and diversity (soil/rock types). Empirical analysis includes: (1) status assessment (recording 35% slope data, diagnosing 40% soil erosion and 30% vegetation degradation); (2) evaluation system construction (12 indicators via AHP, with 25% weight for color richness and 30% for morphological diversity); (3) design optimization (30+ plant species for color-seasonal coordination, boosting vegetation coverage to &gt;80% through engineering-biological measures); and (4) effect monitoring (40% coverage increase and 30% erosion reduction within 6 months, with feedback-driven refinements). Findings show that the aesthetic-ecological design model balances visual appeal (e.g., seasonal color gradients) with ecological resilience (e.g., native vine soil fixation), validated by AHP-weighted morphological diversity as the primary aesthetic driver. The study provides a scientific framework for mountainous city slope landscaping, demonstrating its potential to reconcile urban development with environmental sustainability and offering a replicable model for similar regions.},

This study focuses on using CNN models to solve the problem of feature extraction and modeling in economic management big data, and explores its application value and contribution in this field. The CNN model, with its powerful ability to automatically extract features and capture local correlations in data, can break through the bottleneck of traditional methods in processing high-dimensional and nonlinear economic data. By preprocessing economic big data and applying CNN models, key features from multi-source heterogeneous data such as tax data and market transaction data can be efficiently extracted, avoiding the subjectivity and limitations of manual feature extraction. Through statistical analysis, these characteristics not only reveal the significant differences between China’s population and social economy in the eastern and western regions, but also show the overall trend of the economic development of cities and regions through time and space analysis. The application of CNN models provides a new technological path for economic data analysis, which helps to improve the accuracy of economic forecasting, optimize economic management decisions, and is of great significance for promoting the development of research and practice in the economic field.},

  abstract = {Traditional object repair methods usually rely on complex algorithms and a lot of manual labor, making it difficult to repair large and complex objects. In order to improve the efficiency of repairing large and complex targets and reduce the workload of object repair, an object repair model based on digital twin technology is developed. A charge-coupled device in the mechanical arm collects image data from the target object and transfers it to the real-virtual coordinate matching module. The attention mechanism is introduced to construct a multiscale residual UNet object image segmentation model for real-virtual coordinate matching to deal with the object repair trajectory planning problem. When verifying the function of the model, the loss degree, repair model parameters, and object repair error are used as evaluation indicators. The results of the model performance test revealed that the proposed multiscale residual UNet model for object image segmentation exhibited an accuracy of 0.942 while maintaining a loss value of 0.099 at steady state. Compared to the traditional UNet model, the study’s model had fewer parameters by 20.02 million and a slightly improved prediction accuracy of 0.01 on the self-built dataset. Additionally, the inclusion of the attention module enhanced the prediction accuracy by 0.02 M without adding too many parameters. The experiment demonstrated that the deviation between the predicted and actual object center coordinates was less than 1 mm, both horizontally and vertically. This sub-millimeter accuracy allowed for precise virtual-to-real alignment, which was essential for the operation of high-fidelity digital twins. It also ensured reliable robotic manipulation in demanding applications, such as precision component repair and cultural heritage restoration. Furthermore, the use of a dual-robot cooperative approach proved more effective. It was more effective in completing complex repair tasks. It increased system repair capability. It enabled omni-directional repairs previously unattainable with a single robot arm. Crucially, this dual-robot strategy reduced the time required for complex object repair to under 15 s. This represented a 40% improvement in speed over single-robot operation, while maintaining a repair pass rate of 99.2%.},

  abstract = {Accurately locating product target information is crucial for improving competitiveness and brand image. However, traditional methods are often inefficient and lack robustness in complex visual environments. This study proposes an improved product target information localization model, which takes a dense connection module as the backbone to extract multi-scale feature information. Then, a dynamic convolution module is employed to adaptively fuse responses from different convolution kernels, while an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance key regions. Finally, a multi-stage feature refinement module is applied to progressively optimize edge and structural information, thereby generating high-quality saliency maps and improving localization accuracy and model robustness. Compared with the baseline model without refinement, introducing three feature refinement modules increases the F-measure by 0.026, while dynamic convolution achieves an optimal F-measure of 0.951. Moreover, the combination of two feature refinement modules and dynamic convolution reduces the MAE by 0.018. Compared with four state-of-the-art models (Capsal, PiCANet, PoolNet, and DGRL), I-PFPN consistently outperforms them in F-measure and PR curve evaluations. In practice, the model completes product target localization within approximately 0.5 s per image, making it a fast and effective tool for enterprise-level applications in dynamic market environments.},

However, the structural optimization design and construction scheduling optimization of prefabricated building concrete components urgently need to be solved to meet the sustainable development. Therefore, the research adopts the dragonfly algorithm optimized by multiple strategies to optimize the overall structure of prefabricated concrete components in buildings. BIM technology is applied to build a construction scheduling optimization model that satisfies resource constraints and structural constraints to optimize the scheduling plan of prefabricated components during assembly construction and find the shortest construction period and optimal scheduling plan. The experimental results show that in the comparison of intelligent algorithm iteration curves, the improved algorithm was superior to the standard DA, Nelder-Mead, NS-FPA, and CPSO algorithms. In the multi-modal function test, the optimal result of the research model was 17.54, while the standard DA, Nelder-Mead, NS-FPA, and LMA algorithms were 72.5, 52.5, and 20.3, respectively. The convergence and optimization performance of the research model were both the best. In the specific construction optimization, the improved algorithm effectively reduced the cost of concrete components and increased the ultimate bearing capacity of welded joints by 6.24%. The construction scheduling optimization model based on BIM technology saved 0.2631 working days, or 6.31 h, improving the work efficiency and reducing cost.

This study undertakes an in-depth examination and visualization framework aimed at explicating the spread of artistic content on major social media platforms. By consolidating and analyzing data from Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, and Behance, this study examines 500,000 art-related posts over a 12-month period to identify key dissemination patterns and viral dynamics. The methodological framework utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks for extracting visual features and graph-based approaches for modeling diffusion dynamics, supplemented by advanced visualization techniques to explain complex dynamics of dissemination. Findings reveal that the spread of artistic content follows certain temporal and spatial dynamics, with the visual appeal of an artwork, posting times, and network effects constituting key drivers of virality. The visualization framework utilized integrates interactive network graphs, temporal heat maps, and multi-dimensional scaling to represent dissemination pathways, thus enabling real-time tracking and pattern detection. The predictive models achieve an accuracy level of 87.3% in predicting the viral potential, reflecting a significant performance boost compared to conventional baseline techniques. This study offers novel insights into digital art consumption, provides actionable suggestions for artists and cultural institutions, and establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding the diffusion of creative content in interconnected systems.

  abstract = {Under the dual backdrop of the innovation-driven development strategy and the coordinated development of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, the growth of county-level technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Hebei Province has been constrained by regional heterogeneity in resource endowments and industrial foundations, which conflicts with the uniform application of support policies. Accurately identifying spatial differentiation patterns in policy effectiveness has become essential for optimizing policy implementation. Existing studies have primarily employed traditional models such as ordinary least squares (OLS), overlooking the spatial correlation of county-level economic systems. Moreover, limited attention has been paid to the local spatial heterogeneity of policy variables and enterprise development indicators, the nonlinear characteristics of policy effects at the county scale, and the quantification of spatial spillover effects of support policies. To address these limitations, moderation models, threshold regression models, and the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) were integrated in this study to construct a moderating effect measurement model of support policies. Through this approach, the spatially differentiated effects of support policies for technology-based SMEs across counties in Hebei Province were quantified. The nonlinear moderating mechanisms of policy instruments and their spatial transmission patterns were systematically examined. By integrating spatial econometric techniques with policy effect evaluation frameworks, this study proposes a novel paradigm for regional policy research and offers evidence-based guidance for designing differentiated policy measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of support initiatives in Hebei Province.},

The main objective of the research is to cope with the challenges such as occlusion and lighting changes in complex scenes by improving the detection speed and accuracy. To this end, a novel soccer player tracking detection model is investigated. First, channel pruning and layer pruning techniques are used to optimize YOLOv3, which reduces the computational complexity and the number of parameters, while ensuring high detection accuracy. Second, the feature enhancement module and offset sampling mechanism are designed in combination with the improved DeepSORT multi-target tracking algorithm. By combining the Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm, the accuracy of target prediction and trajectory association is further improved. The experiment outcomes show that on the publicly available football network version 2 dataset, the F1 value of the model reaches 94.56%, and the average processing time is only 0.74 s. On the football player tracking and recognition dataset, the F1 value of the model is 95.27% and the processing time is 0.77 s. In addition, the loss rate is the lowest in occluded scenes, at 8.34%, and the highest trajectory consistency reaches 92.59% in lighting changing environments. From this, the model proposed by the research is significantly superior to existing methods in multiple key performance indicators, and has excellent detection capabilities and practical application potential.

The results show that the scheme maintains design order accuracy in both high and low Mach number flows, with a spatial discretization error of 4.95 orders and a time discretization error convergence order of 5.86 orders.

And this format remains stable even when Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy&gt;1, making it suitable for large-scale industrial simulation, which is beneficial for improving efficiency. In one-dimensional shock tubes, bimodal acoustic pulse collisions, and Lax/Sod problems, the density, velocity, and pressure results of this format are consistent with the reference solution, with no oscillation phenomenon.

Building on the recent work of Singh, Sharma, and Kumar—which introduced a self-accelerating parameter dependent on the last iterate—an in-depth stability analysis of these without memory methods in a vectorial framework is proposed. The main objective is to evaluate how parameters’ selection and variation affect the process’s convergence and stability using tools from discrete dynamical systems, bifurcation diagrams, and dynamical planes. The results demonstrate that certain members of the family, particularly those with fourth-order convergence, exhibit superior stability properties compared to the initially proposed fifth-order scheme. Additionally, numerical tests on various nonlinear systems confirm the theoretical stability results. The stable methods of these families can be successfully applied on realistic problems such as preliminary orbit determination and on the nonlinear systems resulting from the discretization of Fisher’s equation used in population genetics and ecology, convection-diffusion equations appearing in engineering problems, etc.},

  abstract = {Deep analysis of ideological and political education (IPE) data is vital for enhancing pedagogical precision. Addressing limitations of current methods—particularly in comprehending complex semantics, integrating domain knowledge, and evaluating civic-political (Si-Pol) characteristics—this study proposes an improved deep learning algorithm. Our framework augments semantic understanding by structuring external knowledge, employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture key textual information, and incorporates Si-Pol features into the loss function design. Evaluated on the COAE dataset, the model achieved macro-averaged F1 scores of 87.3% and 83.6% on the critical tasks of sentiment orientation recognition and values consistency assessment, respectively. This represents a significant improvement of 3.7% to 8.2% over baseline models (TextCNN, BiLSTM-Attention, base Transformer). The research provides a novel pathway for more accurate and interpretable analysis of IPE effectiveness.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a capacity configuration method for a microgrid composed of a photovoltaic (PV) power generation system and a hybrid energy storage system (battery storage + supercapacitors). The core of this method involves constructing a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and incorporating a battery aging model to determine the retirement time of the energy storage system, thereby optimizing the microgrid capacity configuration. Additionally, this paper explores the integration of supercapacitors (SCs) into the microgrid capacity configuration to effectively mitigate battery aging, enhancing the economic performance and operational efficiency of the microgrid. The proposed method is validated through real-world case studies, demonstrating its practical applicability in microgrid development. Moreover, the case study analysis compares the proposed method with traditional methods that do not consider battery aging factors and conducts a sensitivity analysis regarding changes in energy storage procurement cost parameters. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively addresses the challenges posed by battery aging but also offers superior economic and technical performance in microgrid optimization planning and capacity configuration.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene is often used as the outer protective layer of optical cables due to its excellent dielectric, corrosion resistance, and mechanical properties. However, when facing high-voltage optical cable lines, its insulation ability is slightly insufficient. Therefore, a new type of optical cable sheath has been studied and prepared. This sheath is suitable for optical cable systems with voltage levels of 10 kV and below, and can meet the insulation and protection requirements in power communication scenarios. Firstly, different forms of magnesium oxide were prepared by hydrothermal and redox methods, and added to a polyethylene solution. The magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film was prepared by a solution casting process with thermal crosslinking at 180°C for 15 min. To further improve the performance of composite films, a new type of optical cable sheath material, magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film, was prepared by combining high thermal conductivity alumina with fibrous magnesium oxide/polyethylene. The results showed that when the amount of fibrous magnesium oxide in different forms of magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite films was 1.5 phr, the breakdown strength could reach 468 kV/mm, which was 26.49% higher than that of pure polyethylene, and the dielectric capacity increased by 5%. The direct current breakdown strength of the alumina/magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film was 518 kV/mm, which was 14.11% higher than that of the magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film. The above data indicated that the insulation performance of the modified optical cable sheath was greatly improved, which can adapt to higher voltage optical cable protection. The research provides important references for the design and optimization of new optical cable sheath materials, as well as new ideas and methods for material research in related application fields.},

  abstract = {Scientific physical training management is vital to improve the police’s practical literacy and law enforcement capabilities, and it is also crucial in making the police force move towards formalization and professionalism. Good physical fitness is an essential foundation for the police to perform tasks and an important way to improve and apply police techniques and tactics. As the management of police physical training is a complex process, it is a qualitative concept with “fuzziness,” and it is impossible to accurately and ideally describe its content quantitatively only by classical and random mathematics. To carry out scientific quantitative analysis and objective evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages and to promote the development of police physical training and comprehensively improve the level of police physical fitness. This paper studies the application effect of four kinds of Fuzzy (Fuzzy mathematics) calculation methods in the management evaluation of police physical training by combining the fuzzy formula method with a questionnaire survey. The study results show that using four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) scoring methods can determine the quality level of any police physical training management and rank the comprehensive scores from high too low to distinguish the ranking order clearly. The four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) scoring methods are both scientific and reasonable: (reliability), and is simple and easy to implement (validity). Especially in sports research, quantitative evaluation of people or things in a “fuzzy state” is worthy of praise for development and application. Finally, we concluded that the four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) calculation methods have good feasibility and operability.},

A fusion algorithm of improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ACO algorithm is proposed to solve for optimal paths. Firstly, we improve the PSO and adaptively adjust the inertia weight to facilitate the particle search. Besides, we disturb the particles with the chaotic variables to increase the convergence speed. Secondly, the pheromone distribution on the path is adjusted based on the optimal solution of PSO to solve the initial pheromone insufficiency issue in the ACO algorithm. Then, to optimize the update strategy, we adaptively adjust the pheromone intensity values. We also provide a wide range of control schemes for updating the parameters for balancing the search capability and convergence. The results in the simulation environment show that our algorithm is more effective than other improved algorithms. The improved fusion algorithm converges faster and finds shorter optimal path.

  abstract = {The urban resilient distribution network is a crucial component of a resilient power network, facing various risks such as operational failures, climate impacts, and network attacks. These risks pose significant threats to the security of the power networks. However, the existing methods still have some problems, such as incomplete risk awareness indicators and inaccurate identification of power grid operational state. To ensure the secure and stable operation of an urban power grid, a risk situational awareness model for the resilient distribution network cyber-physical system (CPS) based on data density is developed, along with an enhanced Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting (N-HiTS). Firstly, a more comprehensive risk situation index system is proposed to reflect the characteristics of power grid security situation and provide assessment basis for situation understanding and prediction. Second, the data density is used to determine the typical state of each node in order to distinguish between risk and normal states. Thirdly, a neural hierarchical interpolation algorithm with enhanced predictive capabilities is presented for forecasting future operational characteristics. Finally, a neural random network is used to classify the future states of nodes, and the part that does not belong to the typical state is identified as the risk state, so as to realize the risk situational awareness. The model is validated using actual data from a regional distribution network in East China. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves an identification rate exceeding 95% for all types of risks, and both the index system and the model can improve the situational awareness accuracy of each node by about 2%. Therefore, the proposed method can perceive the future risk posture of CPS nodes in the distribution network and have higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract = {At present, for ecological efficiency evaluation, the traditional data envelopment analysis has the problem that the same model is difficult to take into account different proportions of economic and environmental efficiency analysis. This study innovatively proposes a dual-objective data envelopment analysis (DEA) ecological efficiency model that combines environmental efficiency and economic efficiency. This method is based on data inclusion analysis and addresses the limitations of traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) in balancing economic and environmental efficiency ratios. The results showed that, compared to traditional methods, the new method considered cities with lower ecological efficiency more comprehensively. This was because it incorporated unexpected outputs, such as carbon emissions, and dynamic weight allocation. The provincial ENE was about 0.55 (new method), lower than the traditional data envelopment analysis’s 0.6, reflecting a more rigorous assessment of the model’s environmental impact. The environmental efficiency of a province was about 0.55, while the environmental efficiency of cities in the eastern, central, and western regions was about 0.75, 0.42, and 0.42, respectively. The environmental efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.35 and 0.73, respectively. The economic efficiency of the whole province was around 0.97, and the economic efficiency of the cities in the east, center, and west regions was around 0.99, 0.98, and 0.95, respectively, which were all higher than 0.95 and above. It demonstrated that the economic efficiency of the cities in the east, center and west regions was higher. The economic efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.965 and 0.995, respectively, and the economic efficiency of the province was higher at around 0.977. The ecological efficiency of the whole province was around 0.52. The ecological efficiency of cities in the east, center, and west regions was around 0.72, 0.41, and 0.42, respectively. The ecological efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.38 and 0.73, respectively. From 2020 to 2024, the changes in ecological efficiency in the province were more stable. The economic efficiency of all cities in the period from 2018 to 2020 was generally high, and some cities even reached a perfect score. It shows that the study proposes that the method can provide a new research idea for cracking the contradiction between resource environment and regional development.},

By dynamically adjusting the covariance matrix of KF process noise, the synergistic suppression of high-frequency vibration and pulse type illumination noise can be achieved. The experimental results show that optimizing the ORB algorithm enhances the invariance of feature point direction and scale through the Gaussian difference pyramid and grayscale centroid method, and the success rate of feature point matching is improved by 63.1% compared to the traditional method. In extreme lighting changes and dynamic scenes, the algorithm reduces image pixel offset by 56%–67% and increases peak signal-to-noise ratio by an average of 32%–34%, significantly better than mainstream methods such as histogram equalization and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization. By simplifying the calculation process of ORB feature descriptors, the algorithm’s processing speed increases by 57% compared to the traditional SIFT method, meeting the timeliness requirements of industrial monitoring. In four typical industrial scenarios, the pixel matching accuracy reaches 85.23%, 78.34%, and 83.56% in rotation, scale, and lighting variation scenarios. Compared with gyroscope technology and traditional ORB algorithm, the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed method is improved by an average of 2.56 dB and 1.67 dB, respectively.

In response to the problems of poor recommendation accuracy and low degree of personalization in music recommendation systems, this article combined the optimized LGCN-A (Light Graph Convolution Network-Attitude) algorithm to conduct personalized modeling and recommendation research in music recommendation systems. Firstly, the collected data is cleaned and normalized, and feature data of users and music are extracted. Then, a graph structure between users and music is constructed, and each user and music node is initialized with a feature vector operation. The original feature vectors of users and music can be mapped to the embedding space through linear transformation, and the embedding vector can be initialized using Gaussian distribution and regularized. Finally, based on the traditional NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering) algorithm, lightweight processing can be achieved by reducing nonlinear activation functions and feature transformation steps, and self-attention mechanism can be introduced to assign different weights to different users and music. The experiment is based on the public dataset Million Song Dataset to predict the interaction between users and music, and generate a recommendation list. The results show that at k of 20, the recommendation hit rate of the LGCN-A algorithm reached 0.95, which is 0.19 higher than the traditional NGCF algorithm, and the overlap is only 21.43%.

This study suggests a thorough, data-driven approach for segmenting data using adaptive clustering in order to maximize employee remuneration. The paradigm allows for accurate and comprehensible employee stratification by including new indicators like the wage-to-Performance Ratio (SPR), wage growth rate, and satisfaction elasticity. A real-world corporate dataset was used, and to guarantee data quality, extensive preparation was done, including feature engineering, normalization, and outlier elimination. Different employee segments were created using adaptive clustering, which was assessed against conventional K-Means and directed by internal validation indices (such as the elbow method and silhouette score). Strategic pay changes are informed by empirical evaluation’s actionable findings, which include identifying strong achievers who are underpaid and long-tenured employees who are stagnant. HR professionals may identify high-potential employee cohorts and adopt data-driven, performance-aligned remuneration plans with the help of the suggested strategy.

  abstract = {Education is vital for talent development, and assessing English teaching quality helps teachers improve their methods. However, traditional assessment models are inefficient and time-consuming. To address this, this study proposes a new teaching quality assessment model using a forward rule fast-matching algorithm. This approach improves data processing efficiency by removing irrelevant data through a rule-driven data cleaning. The model integrates a deep belief network with the fast-matching algorithm to create an effective evaluation tool, along with a student performance prediction model. Finally, for model validation, the study used a self-collected dataset that included English performance data from 286 students, which was later expanded to include English performance data from 3500 students from 10 universities of different sizes. Experimental results show that the model performs well, achieving a PR curve area of 0.87 and an F1 value of 0.93. After regularization, the model reduced time consumption by 6.18% and space usage by 3.23%. The average matching time was 319 ms, with 927 matches on average—both better than existing methods. Moreover, the difference between actual and predicted English scores was small, with detection accuracy above 93%. In conclusion, the proposed model offers higher efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in evaluating English teaching quality. The research contributes by reducing time costs and improving evaluation effectiveness, offering a practical solution for real-world teaching assessments. It also advances deep learning by combining deep belief networks with forward rule fast-matching techniques.},

  abstract = {Effective agricultural production supply chain management is the key to optimizing the intelligent transformation strategy of ecological agriculture. Traditional research faces huge challenges in resource optimization and dynamic decision-making. Therefore, this paper first abstracts the intelligent management problem of ecological agriculture as a multi-agent sequential decision-making problem. Then, the cosine function is adopted to improve the Transformer model (EOTransformer). For the entire agricultural production supply chain involved in the cooperation, maintain the encoder and decoder structure of EOTransformer. At each time step, agent observations are encoded by passing them through the encoder to obtain their latent representations. The decoder generates optimal actions of each agent through sequential autoregression to obtain the best strategy. Experimental outcome demonstrates that the suggested approach achieves an approximate 90% reduction in parameter scale over standard approach, greatly reducing the complexity of the algorithm.},

To address these challenges, this study proposes a complete detection and management framework based on an improved YOLOv4 model integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of e-commerce and the increasing diversity of user demands, personalized recommendations on online shopping platforms have become an important direction of research in the field of e-commerce, which is extremely important for promoting the intelligent transformation of the e-commerce industry. Personalized recommendations on online shopping platforms directly promote the growth of e-commerce sales by improving user experience and satisfaction; at the same time, through the application of intelligent recommendation technology, it accelerates the technological innovation of the e-commerce industry and the changes in the competitive landscape. However, current personalized recommendation algorithms still have problems such as poor algorithm performance, long iteration time, and low recommendation precision. To better achieve personalized recommendations for online shopping, this article applies deep Q-network (DQN) to explore personalized recommendation algorithms in depth. In the article, data is first collected and preprocessed through data augmentation, and based on the deep Q-network, a user–product interaction matrix is constructed. Afterward, based on user behavior characteristic data, user behavior modeling is implemented. Then a DQN-based learning architecture is constructed by combining long-term interests, short-term interests, and prediction modules, and a small batch gradient descent method is used to train the function. Finally, this article evaluates the performance of the algorithm. The research results show that when the length of the recommendation list is 1, the accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of the DQN algorithm are 0.924, 0.875, and 0.901, respectively. The recommendation algorithm based on DQN achieves good results in indicators of recommendation accuracy, recall, and mean average precision. In this article, DQN is applied, and the online shopping recommendation system is optimized by combining deep learning and reinforcement learning, significantly improving the quality and efficiency of recommendations and promoting the intelligent development of the e-commerce industry.},

Multi-objective collaborative optimization can help designers find the best balance point between multiple objectives and improve the quality and effectiveness of their designs. Therefore, research proposed a graphic design method that combines user label preference information with multi-objective optimization, which combines user preference information with PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm for multi-objective optimization. The findings showed that when the number of training samples was small, the contour coefficients of each model changed significantly, and the clustering effect of the models was unstable. As the amount of training samples increased, the clustering effect of each model tended to stabilize. The contour coefficients based on improved K-means, K-means++, and classical K-means algorithms were 0.743, 0.707, and 0.546, respectively, indicating that the improved K-means algorithm had the best clustering effect in this study. As the number of users increases, the user accuracy of the research method improves to 0.88. The recall rate of the research method is consistently higher than other comparative methods, at approximately 0.93.

  abstract = {With the development of smart grids, short-term net load prediction for distributed energy is increasingly valued, net load prediction can fully explore the difference between electricity load and renewable energy output, and is the basis for energy management and optimal scheduling. Considering that the correlation between source and charge is not considered in the traditional statistical model, and the prediction accuracy is poor, this paper proposes a short-term net load prediction method for distributed energy based on the Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks (STGCNs) and Attention mechanism. First, the time series of factors such as wind power, solar power, historical characteristics of actual load, and weather environment in the integrated energy system are mapped into the data form of graph structure, and the correlation between variables is calculated using the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC). It is used as the weighted value of the connected edges of nodes to construct the adjacency matrix and initialize the graph network. Then, STGCN is used to autonomous feature extraction of the time series. STGCN can consider the uncertainties at both ends of the source and load at the same time, and fully extract the internal relationship between the source and load variables in the distributed energy graph network. Finally, the Attention mechanism is used to strengthen the feature extraction ability of STGCN model for time series data, improving the short-term net load prediction accuracy. The experiment uses the real power data set of an integrated energy system in a region for verification. Compared with other data-driven methods, the fusion model trained and generated has higher prediction accuracy. At the same time, the trained generated model can adapt to different scale data and different prediction lengths in practice, and has strong generalization ability.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. In the early stage, its symptoms can be easily confused with those of aging, causing patients to miss the optimal treatment period and exacerbating the condition. This study aims to assist doctors in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment by using graph convolutional neural networks. The CA-GCN model was constructed by building an adjacency matrix based on sample similarity, introducing Chebyshev convolution for hierarchical analysis, and leveraging an adaptive mechanism based on clinical information to flexibly adjust the relationships among samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the CA-GCN model has a stable accuracy in diagnosis (AUC, 0.97) and prediction experiments (AUC, 0.88), outperforming common machine learning algorithms. This model improves diagnostic accuracy and assists clinical decision-making, predict disease progression, and thus treat patients in a timely manner, reducing the burden on families.},

As the advancement and application of deep learning, e-commerce platform customer churn prediction models with traditional XGBoost algorithms have emerged one after another. However, traditional XGBoost algorithms have many drawbacks and limitations. These problems with slow training speed, accuracy loss, overfitting, and inability to handle large-scale data. Therefore, an improved XGBoost algorithm is introduced to improve accuracy under the influence of data mining and minimal training resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 78.7%, a prediction precision of 73.5%, and a recall rate of 58.7%. For core and important-development customer categories, the AUC values reached 86.7% and 86.5%, respectively. Compared to baseline models such as SVM, BP neural networks, and C4.5 decision trees, the improved XGBoost demonstrates superior accuracy and stability. These findings confirm that the predicted values are closer to the true labels and that the method provides more reliable and accurate support for customer segmentation and retention strategy development on e-commerce platforms.},

Their utility has since broadened to drag reduction in submarines, micro-coolers, biomedical flow control, and thermal reactors. This study computationally simulates and statistically analyzes the energy transfer efficiency of an electro-magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) Casson trihybrid nanofluid flowing past a vertical radiant Riga plate in scenarios involving natural and forced convection, considering the effects of viscous dissipation, suction, and the nanomaterials’ shape factor. The governing model is solved using a hybrid spectral technique, with numerical results validated against benchmark data. According to the results of the current work, suction augmentation diminishes the tri-hybrid Casson nanofluid’s velocity and drag forces. Elevating the values of mixed convection or Casson factors reduces the Casson tri-hybrid nanofluid’s temperature and enhances its energy transfer. The incorporation of non-spherical nanoparticles reduces the Nusselt number by 0.23%–5.3% and increases skin friction by 1.6%–14% in comparison to using spherical nanoparticles. Multiple regression indicates that thermal radiation is the most positive contributor in boosting energy transfer rates. These insights may advance predictive capabilities for thermal management in energy systems and guide next-generation EMHD reactor design.},

Green sustainable development has been extended to the service field and new technologies, new models, and new business forms of green service have been brought into being. Based on the original data of 213 service-oriented corporates, this paper adopts the questionnaire survey method to explore the mechanism between green service innovation carried out by service-oriented enterprises and consumer happiness based on the perspectives of consumers’ “value identity” and “extra-role altruistic behavior.” This study aims to solve the problem of how green service innovation provided by corporates translates into consumer happiness. The findings are as follows: Value identity has a mediating effect between corporate green service innovation and consumer extra-role altruistic behavior (beneficial to corporates and environment), and consumer extra-role altruistic behavior has a serial mediating effect between corporate green service innovation and consumer happiness. Resource heterogeneity positively moderates the relationship between corporate green service innovation and consumer value identity. Resource coupling also positively moderates the relationship between consumers’ value identity and their extra-role altruistic behavior. The conclusion extends the research boundary of enterprise green service innovation and adds a new perspective and context. Moreover, the research results also provide reference for the service innovation transformation of related corporates.},

  abstract = {Tiny Artificial Intelligence (Tiny AI) is transforming resource-constrained embedded systems, particularly in e-health applications, by introducing a shift in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike conventional machine learning (ML), which demands substantial processing power, TinyML strategically delegates processing requirements to the cloud infrastructure, allowing lightweight models to run on embedded devices. This study aimed to (i) Develop a TinyML workflow that details the steps for model creation and deployment in resource-constrained environments and (ii) apply the workflow to e-health applications for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The methodology employs a dataset of 4097 EEG recordings per patient, each 23.5 seconds long, from 500 patients, to develop a robust and resilient model. The model was deployed using TinyML on microcontrollers tailored to hardware with limited resources. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) efficiently runs ML models on small devices, such wearables. Simulation outcomes demonstrated significant performance, particularly in predicting epileptic seizures, with the ExtraTrees Classifier achieving a notable 99.6% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the validation set. Because of its superior performance, the ExtraTrees Classifier was selected as the preferred model. For the optimized TinyML model, the accuracy remained practically unchanged, whereas inference time was significantly reduced. Additionally, the converted model had a smaller size of 256 KB, approximately ten times smaller, making it suitable for microcontrollers with a capacity of no more than 1 MB.
          These findings highlight the potential of TinyML to significantly enhance healthcare applications by enabling real-time, energy-efficient decision-making directly on local devices. This is especially valuable in scenarios with limited computing resources or during emergencies, as it reduces latency, ensures privacy, and operates without reliance on cloud infrastructure. Moreover, by reducing the size of training datasets needed, TinyML helps lower overall costs and minimizes the risk of overfitting, making it an even more cost-effective and reliable solution for healthcare innovations.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of power load is one of the important research directions in demand response uncertainty. Accurate and effective power system load forecasting is an important prerequisite for ensuring the safety, stable operation, and normal production of the power grid. To improve the accuracy of short-term load forecasting in power systems under demand response scenarios, this paper proposes a Transformer load forecasting method that considers demand response potential. Firstly, the change law of response uncertainty with electricity price difference and consumer psychology principles are used to quantify the power demand response results under different probability conditions. Then, Transformer neural networks are used to extract features from user historical load, temperature, electricity price, and other time series data. Finally, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to pay attention to the structural relationship between time series data, analyze the importance of input variables at each historical moment on the current load, and achieve high-precision prediction of user load and demand response potential. This article takes industrial users as an example to predict the power load and demand response regulation power of the general component manufacturing industry. Through comparative analysis with actual data, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with other existing methods, the Transformer model that considers demand response performs well in power load forecasting, providing a certain theoretical basis for evaluating the potential of demand response. The subsequent work will study the characteristics of electric, hot, and cold loads and their coupling relationships under the difference of electricity prices, and improve the forecasting performance of user loads and Demand Response Regulation power, so as to reduce the power generation and operation costs of the grid.},

Conventional therapies like erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) face limitations including injection dependency, cardiovascular risks, and iron intolerance. Vadadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), offers a novel mechanism by stabilizing HIF-α subunits to enhance endogenous EPO production, improve iron utilization, and promote erythropoiesis. Pharmacokinetically, Vadadustat exhibits rapid absorption (peak: 2–3 hours), dose-proportional exposure, minimal accumulation, and 99.5% plasma protein binding, with adjustments recommended in dialysis-dependent CKD due to reduced clearance. Phase III clinical trials demonstrate non-inferiority of Vadadustat versus Darbepoetin Alfa in maintaining target hemoglobin levels across dialysis-dependent (DD-CKD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD-CKD) populations. However, while Vadadustat met cardiovascular safety endpoints in DD-CKD (INNO2VATE trials), it showed a higher major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk in NDD-CKD (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01–1.36). Common adverse events include hypertension (14%), gastrointestinal disturbances (13%), and thrombosis. Drug interactions with oral iron, OAT3 inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol), and BCRP substrates require monitoring. Approved for adults with dialysis-dependent CKD (≥3 months duration), Vadadustat provides an effective oral alternative to ESAs, with potential advantages in iron mobilization and flexible thrice-weekly dosing.

  abstract = {The coupled lateral-torsional vibration of thin-walled beams under moving harmonic loads holds critical engineering relevance. For example, vehicles traversing uneven roads induce vertical oscillations that translate into harmonic excitations on thin-walled beams. Based on Vlasov’s thin-walled beam theory, this study establishes closed-form time-domain solutions for the lateral-torsional displacements of mono-symmetric thin-walled beams by transforming the coupled partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations via modal expansion, and solving them through Laplace transform and its inverse. A finite element solution program based on the Newmark-β algorithm is created for validation purposes, with verification results demonstrating close alignment between analytical and numerical solutions. A key innovation involves representing a single vehicle load as two eccentric lateral forces in parameter analysis, enhancing the accuracy of simulating vehicle-induced dynamics. Furthermore, parametric studies quantitatively characterize the effects of critical control parameters (excitation frequency, moving speed, span length, load eccentricity, and warping stiffness) on lateral-torsional coupling displacements. Key conclusions are that torsional displacement is more velocity-sensitive; warping suppresses peak amplitudes. These findings provide a profound foundation for designing thin-walled bridges to avoid resonance.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization and the rise of cultural industries, the planning and advancement of urban cultural industry has become an important research object. To study the advancement of urban cultural industry planning, this study proposes a comprehensive fuzzy algorithm research system. The methodology dynamically optimizes indicator weights through a fusion of static weights (determined via Analytic Hierarchy Process) and dynamic weights (derived from Euclidean distance-based similarity normalization). A multi-dimensional digital indicator system spanning digital factor investment, innovation environment, and industry competition is constructed, with competitiveness quantitatively assessed using entropy weighting. FP-Growth further mines implicit association rules among indicators to enhance correlation analysis. Experiments show that when the number of people involved is 400 thousand, the calculation time of the research method is 330 s, which is significantly improved compared with the performance of the comparison method which exceeds 900 s. In the runtime data volume test, the retained data volume generated by the research method in 500 s was only approximately 130M, which was much less than 310M and 220M of the comparison methods. During the data processing, the data error rate in the retained data tends to be stable and fluctuates between 2% and 3%. The research methods have obtained accurate and effective analysis results on the promotion of urban cultural industry planning in both types of countries. This indicates that the research method has good performance and practical application effects and can provide effective references for urban cultural industry planning.},

Learning management systems (LMSs) that are housed on the cloud, mobile applications for tailored language learning, chatbots driven by artificial intelligence for language practice, virtual reality technologies for language learning, and data analytics tools for tracking student progress are the five distinct possibilities that are presented at this time. On the basis of eight criteria, each alternative is given careful examination. These criteria are as follows: cost-effectiveness, flexibility, customization, security, integration, and scaling. A crucial component of the decision-making process is the CRITIC-AROMAN method, which functions inside a Fermatean fuzzy (FF) environment. Through an analysis of the relationships between the various criteria, CRITIC guarantees that a comprehensive assessment of the relevance of each criterion is carried out by accurately balancing them. Then, in order to measure the effectiveness of the alternatives, AROMAN employs ratio evaluations and ranks them according to how well they performed in comparison to these criteria. However, the FF environment offers a flexible framework for dealing with imprecise data, despite the fact that the decision-making process is riddled with ambiguity. In the end, these techniques make it possible to conduct an organized and comprehensive evaluation of the many IT-driven options that may be implemented in English as Second Language (ESL) classrooms. This, in turn, makes it possible to make informed decisions that are in accordance with the objectives and priorities of the institution.},

The experimental group adopted the classroom interactive Chinese teaching mode based on IoT technology, and the control group adopted the traditional Chinese teaching mode. Before and after the experiment, the college students in the two groups were tested on their comprehensive language ability and questionnaire survey on their satisfaction with language learning, and at the same time, the college students in the experimental group were interviewed to collect their evaluations and feedbacks on the teaching mode. The experimental results show that the comprehensive language ability and language learning satisfaction of the college students in the experimental group are significantly higher than those in the control group, and both of them are significantly improved during the experimental period, which indicates that the teaching mode has a positive impact on college students' language learning.

To effectively manage and control energy consumption, this study proposes a study on intelligent perception of energy consumption through trust transmission among Internet of Things nodes.

Firstly, it conducts research on the intelligent perception trust model for Internet of Things nodes to ensure accurate calculation and evaluation of node trust, and to adapt to changes in the Internet of Things environment. Secondly, a trust transmission energy consumption intelligent perception model based on multi-agent nodes in the Internet of Things is constructed. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of trust transmission and control energy consumption, the concept of multi-agent is introduced and combined with energy consumption intelligent perception technology. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of the model decreases from the initial 0.56 to 0.24 with the change in the number of recombinations, a decrease of approximately 57%. As the number of cycles changes, it decreases from the initial 0.51 to 0.22, a decrease of approximately 57%. It is evident that it has significant advantages in energy consumption control.

By uncovering these insights, targeted training and improvement plans can be developed, enhancing player performance and optimizing competitive outcomes. Association rules in data mining techniques are used, and the Apriori algorithm in association rules is analyzed and improved. The ACARMI algorithm (an improved algorithm of constrained association rule mining based on item) is then applied. Then, data from six top badminton competitions is collected and converted into Boolean data suitable for this algorithm. A data mining module is designed to mine the tactical association rules of all players, and a specific analysis is conducted on one of the players, successfully analyzing their tactical strategies. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this article, FP-Growth algorithm and DHP algorithm are applied to comparative experiments. The experiment shows that compared with the FP-Growth algorithm, the initial and final running times of the algorithm in this article with minimum support and different constraint numbers are around “355 ms and 75 ms,” “150 ms and 45 ms,” respectively; similarly, compared with the DHP algorithm, they are around “165 ms and 35 ms,” “175 ms and 55 ms,” respectively. Under two sets of experiments, the algorithm proposed in this article presents better operational efficiency.

  abstract = {Pulse repetition interval (PRI) selection significantly impacts the performance of modern radar systems. Although fixed PRI radar systems have made significant advancements, they face inherent challenges such as vulnerability to interference, deception, and high sidelobe levels. To mitigate these issues, random PRI radar systems have been developed, offering improved multitarget detection and enhanced anti-jamming capabilities. However, random PRI introduces complexity in sidelobe suppression, which is critical for maintaining radar system performance. This paper reviews sidelobe suppression techniques in random PRI radar, focusing on the Cyclic Algorithm-New (CAN) and various window functions, including Hanning, Hamming, Kaiser, and Chebyshev windows. By leveraging the CAN algorithm’s unique capability to optimize phase in the frequency domain, this study transfers the traditional trade-off between main lobe width and sidelobe suppression to edge effects. The results demonstrate that applying time-domain windowing to the time-domain sequence (which was optimized in the frequency domain via the CAN algorithm) significantly improves sidelobe suppression, with the Chebyshev window showing superior performance in high-precision scenarios. This work provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for enhancing radar system performance in complex electromagnetic environments.},

To address the issues of malicious program propagation control, this study uses the deep deterministic gradient algorithm to design a malicious program patch control method. On the basis of analyzing the propagation mechanism of malicious programs, intrusion detection systems are used to model the malicious programs. The rehabilitation model for susceptible infected individuals is applied to describe the process of malware transmission and construct a composite malware patch propagation model. A malicious program patch control method based on the dual deep Q-network algorithm is designed by introducing a composite malicious program patch propagation model. The dual deep Q-network algorithm could achieve network equilibrium in 45 time steps. Under the attack of malicious programs with different hit rates, the peak proportion of susceptible devices reached 0.07, 0.02, and 0.286, respectively. The number of devices infected by high hit rate malicious programs was 2.81 times that of devices infected by low hit rate malicious programs. In dynamic network environments, the DDPV method showed good adaptability, could effectively control the propagation of malicious programs under different dynamic conditions, and maintained high network gains and patch success rates. Therefore, adopting the designed malicious program patch control method can effectively suppress the spread of malicious programs by quickly identifying and sending patches, providing strong support for building a secure network environment.},

  abstract = {In the context of educational digital transformation and the deep integration of intelligent technologies, Mixed Reality (MR) technology has enabled the creation of immersive collaborative environments, offering a novel paradigm for student team-based innovation and design practice. However, the exponential growth of interaction data and the dynamic complexity of collaborative scenarios in MR environments have presented a critical challenge: accurately capturing behavioral features within both human-computer interaction (HCI) and social collaborative interaction (SCI) to improve collaborative efficiency. Existing research demonstrates three major limitations: (i) single-modality data are insufficient to reflect the social context of team collaboration; (ii) static feature extraction methods fail to accommodate the evolving demands of design tasks; and (iii) inadequate modeling of team role differentiation has resulted in suboptimal interdisciplinary collaboration recommendations. To address these issues, a dynamic interaction recommendation method based on dual interaction relationship inference was proposed. A five-layered processing model—comprising an input layer, embedding layer, student preference extraction layer, team preference extraction layer, and prediction layer—was constructed. Dynamic student operation trajectories were captured using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, while global and local attention mechanisms were employed to integrate team interaction data, enabling multi-level modeling of both personalized preferences and collaborative contexts. This study represents the first integration of dual interaction relationships into a recommendation framework, overcoming the limitations of conventional single-modality approaches. A dynamic, role-sensitive solution is thereby provided for intelligent collaboration systems in MR-based educational environments, offering significant theoretical and practical implications for the digital transformation of education.},

  abstract = {In the context of current tourism informatization, with the rapid development of Internet, artificial intelligence and other technologies, tourism data mining technology has been widely used. To solve the problem of insufficient depth in tourism data analysis, Apriori and strong association rule algorithms are studied to design tourism data mining techniques. Based on the traditional Apriori algorithm, this study analyzes its shortcomings in processing large amounts of data and proposes the use of correlation to fuse frequent itemsets in the Apriori algorithm, in order to improve the effectiveness of strong association rules. Meanwhile, parallelization is introduced to continue optimization, and the practical application value is analyzed and judged. The experiment outcomes indicate that when using the Apriori algorithm and strong association rule extraction for efficiency and accuracy experiments, the implementation time is reduced by 359%. The generated association rules account for 25.67% of the total, with an efficiency 2.6 times faster than other algorithms. The maximum and minimum correlation values are 1.3 and 1.1, respectively, with a range error of no more than 0.3. The changes in support and credibility are more stable and reliable than other algorithms. The data show that the optimized Apriori strong association rule mining algorithm designed has significantly improved computational efficiency and accuracy. The research results are of great significance for the data mining and development of tourism systems.},

Grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), it develops an integrated framework that combines psychological and technological dimensions. Based on data collected through an online questionnaire and analyzed via structural equation modeling, the study finds that algorithmic technology enhances consumers’ perceived ease of use by improving access to live-streaming interfaces and increases perceived enjoyment by strengthening anchor effectiveness. These factors jointly shape consumers’ attitudes toward live shopping. Additionally, algorithmic mechanisms such as data targeting, user labeling, scoring systems, and group-based recommendations significantly affect behavioral intentions through both direct and mediated pathways, including attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and promotional incentives. This research offers a novel empirical contribution by modeling how algorithmic personalization impacts live shopping behaviors, providing theoretical and practical insights for digital commerce applications.},

  abstract = {In education, it is crucial to comprehensively evaluate the physical fitness of students. The limitations of information processing and analysis efficiency make it difficult for traditional evaluation methods to reveal deep physical correlation patterns. Given this, this study will focus on innovative evaluation methods that combine frequent pattern growth algorithms. An Apriori association rule model based on transaction compression and hash optimization is proposed to address association classification between physical fitness indicators. Moreover, this study optimizes operational efficiency through preprocessing techniques and hash acceleration strategies. It introduces enhancement parameters to accurately identify and establish strong association rules to achieve efficient and accurate evaluation of student physical fitness. The results showed that by comparing the running time of K-means + FP-growth and improved FP-growth under different support levels, the improved FP-growth tended to stabilize after a support level of 0.2%. The optimized model improved the execution efficiency by 82.87%–88.4% compared to Apriori and FP-growth in physical measurement data processing. The effectiveness and reliability of the improved algorithm were verified by measuring strong association rules with the introduction of enhancement degree. This study is expected to better understand the physical fitness status of students, and provide new ideas for educational decision-making and practice, which has profound practical significance for promoting innovation in physical fitness assessment methods.},

Financial staff play a very important role in an enterprise, and their mental health issues can have negative impacts on the operational efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. However, current methods for analyzing mental health suffer from high costs, low accuracy, and low efficiency. In response to this, a financial staff mental health analysis model that combines biosensing technology and decision tree algorithm is proposed. This model is applied to enterprise management work.

The study selected 100 employees as the research subjects. Through a 3-month follow-up monitoring period, data was collected and the validity of the model was verified. The F1 score, recognition accuracy, recognition time, and recall rate were 0.94, 95.28%, 2.31 seconds, and 93.84%, respectively. Compared with other models, its performance was significantly better. In addition, in practical application experiments, the psychological health analysis accuracy of the proposed model reached 95.35%. In practical applications, the turnover rate and performance of the financial staff in the corresponding enterprises decreased and increased by 8.09% and 10.20%, respectively.

By introducing a momentum coefficient, a grouping position update strategy, and a reverse learning mechanism, the PGWO algorithm significantly improves global search capability and convergence speed, effectively avoiding early convergence to a local optimum. Taking the accurate identification of traffic violations as the core issue, this study applies PGWO algorithm to the traffic violation prediction model based on the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset. By comparing and analyzing the original Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm and other traditional optimization algorithms, PGWO showed excellent performance in improving the accuracy of traffic violation arrest. In addition, the PGWO algorithm has been integrated into the PNN regression prediction model, and its effectiveness and superiority in the field of traffic laws have been further verified through testing on the Kaggle dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the PGWO algorithm not only achieves greater accuracy in predicting traffic violations but also enhances the model’s generalization ability, providing a new optimization strategy and decision support tool for intelligent traffic management and regulatory compliance.},

In performance testing, the average gas consumption of this technology in blockchain is only 1.12, far lower than other technologies, and the resource cost advantage is obvious. In the encryption time test, when the number of encryption attributes exceeds 45, the traditional encryption technology significantly increases the encryption time. However, the research technology is similar to reference, and when the number of attributes is between 5 and 15, there is a 7.25% improvement in encryption performance compared to reference. In addition, in government recorded scenarios, the interception rate reached 99.4% under high load (1500 attacks), with 1491 intercepted attacks, outperforming other technologies. In addition, in the delay and throughput testing of the encryption process, the maximum delay of the research technology was only 352 ms when the encryption attributes were 68, and the maximum throughput was 3584 TX/s, both of which were superior to similar technologies.

Although project-based learning (PBL) has been widely recognized for its pedagogical benefits, existing research has primarily focused on quantitative evidence of its effectiveness, with limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which PBL fosters these skills. Moreover, few studies have explored how PBL supports CTS and RCA development in Chinese college EFL contexts. To address these gaps, this study explores how PBL facilitates the development of CTS and RCA by employing a qualitative case study approach. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, classroom observations, and journals. Purposive sampling with maximum variation was employed, and three cases from high, medium, and low levels of CTS and RCA were selected as participants of the study. Thematic analysis was conducted within cases and across cases. The study reveals that PBL fosters CTS by engaging students in problem-solving, inquiry-based learning, and reflective evaluation. In addition, it enhances RCA by integrating explicit reading instruction, authentic material engagement, and collaborative discussions. Moreover, the study highlights differentiated development pathways in CTS and RCA across learners with varying proficiency levels, supported by adaptive scaffolding that facilitates their integrated growth. The findings contribute to the literature by proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the cognitive and instructional mechanisms through which PBL supports CTS and RCA development in EFL contexts.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, Linux operating system, as an open source system, is widely used in servers, embedded devices, and cloud computing platforms. Because of its stability, flexibility, and efficiency, Linux systems play a role in many key areas. However, with the complexity of application environment and the expansion of system scale, the reliability and performance evaluation of Linux system have gradually become the focus of research. Based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, this paper proposes a new reliability benchmarking and dynamic performance evaluation method of Linux system. By constructing a fuzzy evaluation model, the reliability of Linux system is comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated, and through comparative analysis, the dynamic performance optimization strategy of Linux system in different running environments is put forward. Based on experimental data and actual usage scenarios, this paper collects performance data of multiple Linux systems in terms of load, network transmission, IO operation, etc., covering mainstream versions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian. Through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of these data, the reliability scores of different system versions are obtained, and their performance bottlenecks are deeply analyzed. The experimental results show that the reliability score of Ubuntu system under high load conditions is 82.5%, while the reliability score of CentOS system is slightly lower at 78.3%. Through dynamic performance evaluation, it is found that IO performance fluctuates significantly under high concurrency, which affects the stability and response speed of the system. The evaluation method proposed in this paper can not only accurately reflect the performance of Linux system in practical application but also provide theoretical basis and technical support for system optimization. The research results are of great significance to improve the reliability and performance of Linux systems, especially in large-scale applications and demanding industry environments.},

  abstract = {Chinese ceramic culture has a long history, and Chinese ceramics are closely related to the process of Chinese history. In each era, the dissemination and evolution of Chinese ceramics has formed its own characteristics in the dissemination background and channels, dissemination characteristics, and dissemination influences. Ceramic culture is the common artistic language of mankind, which exists in the form of a special cultural symbol. It has a long history and profound cultural heritage, and plays an important role in Sino-foreign exchanges. However, there are many difficulties and challenges in the process of communication and dissemination with cultures from all over the world. It is increasingly an important topic to study the propagation path of ceramic culture, so as to promote overseas spread for ceramic culture. This work uses complex networks to predict and analyze the propagation path of ceramic culture. First, this work selects the BP network as the basic framework to predict the propagation path of ceramic culture. Neural networks are complex networks that can perform such tasks efficiently. Second, because the BP algorithm has problems such as slow convergence and easy to be affected by the initial weight, this work uses the PSO algorithm to make up for the shortcomings of BP algorithm. To solve slow convergence in the later stage of the PSO algorithm and easy to fall into local optimum, this paper adopts improved strategy with dynamic inertia weight and dynamic learning factor. Third, this work integrates the improved PSO (IPSO) with the BP network to construct an IPSO-BP network, and realizes the prediction of the propagation path of ceramic culture based on IPSO-BP.},

  abstract = {Whether tourism resources can be scientifically and effectively developed and utilized is directly related to the amount of economic benefits that tourism resources bring to developers, as well as the revenue data of the local tourism industry. Therefore, how to develop tourism resources has become the main issue that countless scenic area developers need to study today. When formulating a tourism resource development plan using traditional methods, it is usually necessary to arrange researchers to evaluate the quantity and quality of the tourism resources owned by the scenic area. This process often takes several months, and after obtaining the evaluation data, it will be submitted to the decision-making level for repeated and unpredictable meetings and discussions. The discussion mainly focuses on the proportion of service investment and specific measures for each resource in the scenic area, and finally a preliminary plan is obtained. In response to the drawbacks of traditional methods such as time-consuming and cumbersome steps, this study attempts to apply genetic algorithms to optimize the development of tourism resources, hoping to provide an intelligent and efficient method for formulating development plans. The process of using genetic algorithms to develop tourism resource development plans is as follows. Firstly, the optimization task was modeled, abstracted into a mathematical representation that the model can understand, and model parameters were set for subsequent iterative tasks; then, the population was randomly initialized to provide a richer gene pool for the entire population, allowing individuals in the population to be distributed throughout the solution space. Next, it is necessary to iterate the population, where individuals within the population undergo selection, crossover, and mutation in each iteration round, while adding randomness to evolve towards higher fitness values. When the iteration round ends, the highest fitness value of individuals in the population can converge, and this individual represents the best solution considered by the model. Five simulation experiments were conducted in this article. The initial population size was 100, 120, 140, 80, and 70, and the number of iteration rounds was 100, 80, 70, 110, and 130. Finally, the highest fitness values of the five experiments all converge to 208.9, and the X of the individual with the highest fitness values converges to [1,1,1,0,0]. Y converges approximately at [0.44, 0.41, 0.15, 0,0], and Z converges at [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]. Finally, this article also compares with examples of rural tourism development to verify the effectiveness and practicality of genetic algorithms in optimizing tourism resources. After calculation, the sample distance between excellent development cases and model generated solutions is 7.512, the sample distance between negative cases and model generated solutions is 31.836, and the sample distance between fuzzy cases and model generated solutions is 16.757. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of genetic algorithms can provide scientific decision support and methodological guidance for the development and utilization of tourism resources.},

  abstract = {With the widespread application of AI image generation technology in higher education design fields, traditional design education models face the necessity of reevaluation. This study aims to explore how design aesthetic features (as objective product attributes) influence designers’ creative thinking and design expression (as subjective capabilities), and accordingly reassess the educational value of foundational design courses in the AI era. Using a comparative experimental method, the research recruited 25 first-year and 25 third-year industrial design students to create product designs using Midjourney, with 36 industrial design experts systematically evaluating the works. Results indicate that design aesthetic features significantly impact design expression more than design thinking, and the two student groups demonstrate notable differences in design element application: novice design students primarily express creativity through intuitive visual elements such as product patterns and product appearance, while advanced students more effectively utilize professional design elements like form contours and material textures, reflecting how design education facilitates students' transition from perceptual cognition to rational analysis. Additionally, the positive correlation between creative thinking and design expression strengthens with deepening design education, indicating a mutually reinforcing relationship. Based on these findings, the paper suggests that foundational design courses in the AI-generated imagery era need repositioning: color and expression courses should shift from basic skill training to high-level theoretical education, creative thinking courses significantly increase in importance, form and material courses maintain core value but need content updates aligned with AI characteristics, while human-computer collaborative design should become a new curricular direction. This study provides an empirical foundation for design education reform in the AI era, emphasizing the importance of understanding design essentials and cultivating innovative thinking.},

It enables teachers and students alike to communicate a gamut of emotions through its visuals. Nevertheless, the abstract and subjective nature of emotions coupled with the intricate and nonlinear relationship between image characteristics and image sentiment presents a formidable challenge in image emotion classification. Thus, this study proposes a novel image emotion classification model that integrates the depth separable convolution technique. First, the RGB features of the image are extracted through the judicious use of yellow correction, brightness adjustment, and size scaling, while optimizing color video signal transmission with YCrCb. Second, the deep semantic features of the image are extracted through multi-scale fusion features using an improved FPN model, wherein pre-training parameters of ResNet101 are transferred to the model. Finally, the emotion semantics in art images are classified using a convolution block attention module to form a depth separable convolution. Experimental results reveal that the 33 image evaluation features obtained through training have a strong correlation with the expressed emotional semantics. The predictive capacity of the proposed model aligns with the true polarity of the sample with a remarkable accuracy of 93.31% in emotional classification.},

In addition to using the short-term energy difference (STED) technique to precisely determine the temporal assessment of every note in the audio of a piano performance. Additionally, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to assess pitch accuracy.

The piano performances are categorized as “Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor” in this examination, which is structured for a classification problem. Our findings emphasize the efficacy of the SHS-IPNN technique, as demonstrated by its overall performance in terms of recall (90.5%), accuracy (96%), F1-score (93.5%), and precision (95.5%). The experimental outcomes indicate that the SHS-IPNN model outperforms existing methods in terms of accurately detecting performance errors and evaluating piano performances.

  abstract = {Portrait painting, as a traditional art form, has seen increasing research efforts aimed at automating its creation with the advancement of computer technology. Currently, research on computer-generated portrait painting primarily focuses on using deep learning models to generate high-quality artistic style works from input images. However, despite the application of advanced technologies such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) in this field, there are still shortcomings in terms of preserving image details and features. To address this, the study proposes a portrait design model based on dynamic receptive fields (DyRF), whose core innovation lies in introducing multi-scale convolutional modules and adaptive receptive field mechanisms to achieve dynamic perception of features and precise reconstruction of details in different image regions, significantly enhancing the image’s ability to retain details and artistic expression. Experimental results show that DyRF significantly outperforms comparison models on multiple key metrics: achieving a Fréchet depth distance (FID) of 12.21, approximately 30% lower than DyMo (17.65) and FSGAN (23.66); it achieves a feature similarity (FSIM) of 0.85, significantly higher than SCA-GAN (0.71) and FSGAN (0.68), indicating superior performance in terms of image realism and feature consistency.

At the same time, VR technology is introduced to build an immersive virtual environment, so that designers and users can intuitively experience the landscape effect in three-dimensional space, breaking through the limitations of traditional plane or two-dimensional display methods. The experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, this method significantly improves the scientificity, interactivity, and design efficiency of landscape design schemes: the enthusiasm of designers is increased by 70%, and 66.3% of designers say that the design time is greatly shortened; public satisfaction is increased from 13.3% “very satisfied” under traditional design to 50%, and design risks and costs are effectively controlled. Research shows that the integration of intelligent big data and VR technology not only solves the pain points in the traditional design process but also promotes the transformation of design thinking from one-way expression to multi-party collaboration, expands the expressiveness and social acceptance of landscape design, and provides the industry with a new technical path and practice paradigm.},

The experiments show that the proposed multi-feature fusion tracking method can still achieve a better tracking effect in the case of high target similarity, with direct applications in real-time analysis of athletes’ movement trajectories and tactical behaviors during physical education classes. Different IoU thresholds can ultimately affect the tracking performance of the algorithm to a large extent, providing quantitative support for optimizing teaching evaluation systems. It can be seen from the results that when the IoU threshold is 0.5, the algorithm achieves the best tracking performance, with the HOTA index improving by 3.8 points compared to the benchmark method, AssA index by 6.4 points compared to the benchmark method, and IDF 1 index by 7.1 points compared to the benchmark method.

The tracking method consists of three-level target associations, and the similarity needed to calculate the association is calculated using the information of twin network, multi-feature fusion, and spatial location.

  abstract = {Forklifts, as one of the most commonly used transportation tools in current engineering construction, have extremely high research value. With the increasing energy-saving requirements of the forklift industry, energy-saving improvement of the lifting system in the hydraulic lifting system of forklifts has become a research hotspot. To optimize the energy saving of the forklift hydraulic lifting system, this research proposes to use the secondary regulation technology to optimize it. The gravity potential energy generated in the lifting of the load is recovered through the secondary components, and stored in the energy accumulator to provide energy for the operation of the system, to reduce the energy consumption of the engine. The experimental results show that compared to traditional lifting systems, the proposed secondary regulation lifting system saves 29 kJ of energy consumption and can achieve an efficiency of 87.8%. In addition, the load weight, lifting speed, and energy storage capacity all have varying degrees of influence on the energy consumption of the improved secondary regulation system. When the load weight is 5 kg and 15 kg, the energy consumption difference between the two is 75 kJ, and the displacement difference is 0 m. When the lifting speed is 0.1 m/s and 0.3 m/s, the displacement distance difference between the two is 1.5 m, and the energy consumption difference is 123 kJ. When the energy storage capacity is 5 L and 11 L, the displacement distance difference is 0.1 m, and the energy consumption difference is 89 kJ. Therefore, the improved secondary regulation and lifting system proposed in the study has high energy-saving performance.},

  abstract = {With the development of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and cloud computing, there has been a sweeping wave of digitalization across diverse fields and countries. Research indicates that digitalization has driven a surge in research and development (R&amp;D) activities and significantly enhanced R&amp;D efficiency. Cost review is a critical aspect of managing R&amp;D efficiency. However, traditional cost review methods no longer suffice in meeting the demands of the digital era. This raises the question of whether digital technologies, such as LLM, can facilitate an evolutionary shift towards a more automated and efficient cost review approach that synergizes human and machine efforts. This paper validated the positive impact of digital technology on R&amp;D efficiency using a Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) model and the impulse response analysis. Based on empirical results, we discussed the role of LLM in cost review and evaluated the potential risks associated with its use. To mitigate these risks, we recommended that integrating LLM with expert insights for analysis and interpretation, ensuring more reliable outcomes.},

An elephant herding optimization algorithm and support vector machine-based network intrusion detection method are proposed to address the difficulties and low detection accuracy of the detection. This method first uses an optimized elephant swarm optimization algorithm to select features from the intrusion data and then uses the elephant swarm optimization method to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine algorithm. Finally, a detection model is constructed based on support vector machines. The main contribution of the research is the proposal of a network intrusion detection method based on improved swarm optimization algorithm and support vector machine. By using an improved swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine classification algorithm, this method significantly improves the accuracy and stability of detection when dealing with the classification task of network intrusion detection. The experimental results show that the detection model has a stable average accuracy of around 94% in detecting four types of intrusion data, surpassing the performance of other commonly used algorithms.

In response to the challenges of scarce and uneven quality of mural image data, the system adopts a two-stage progressive training strategy. Firstly, a deep convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a large general image dataset to obtain the basic visual feature representation and then fine-tuned and optimized on a professional mural dataset through a domain adaptive method. The feature extraction stage innovatively integrates the high-level semantic features of deep neural networks with the low-level artistic features of traditional image processing. Among them, the deep features are extracted through an improved residual network architecture, while the artistic features blend the color distribution features based on the HSV color space with the improved rotational invariance LBP texture features. The system innovatively designs a feature fusion module based on the attention mechanism, achieving dynamic optimization and combination of multi-source features through learnable feature weights. Experimental verification shows that, compared with mainstream deep network models, this system has achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy of feature recognition in the era of murals. At the same time, it has demonstrated excellent generalization performance in cross-dataset tests, providing reliable technical support and new methodological guidance for the intelligent research of cultural heritage.},

This article investigates the impact of integrating PBL methods into classroom instruction, guided by students’ learning objectives and supported by questionnaire responses. The study focuses on six IPTC classes at a university where PBL was implemented, examining various aspects of the implementation process and proposing corresponding countermeasures. As electronic devices increasingly rely on embedded systems, engineers face escalating challenges in system design and must acquire new, interdisciplinary skills. To meet these demands, it is essential for engineers to bridge knowledge gaps across traditionally distinct fields. However, there are ongoing concerns that current educational institutions do not provide a sufficiently robust foundation for such interdisciplinary learning. This study employed comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of PBL-based instruction, using both test scores and student feedback. A paired-sample test comparing post-test results between the control and experimental groups revealed a statistically significant difference (

The research introduces a data-driven method utilizing deep learning (DL)-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and respond to customer feedback, thereby enhancing engagement through personalized, timely, and context-aware communication. Data was collected from social media, customer service chat transcripts, and online feedback from energy company websites. The text was refined using preprocessing techniques such as lemmatization and stop-word removal. Word2Vec was used for feature extraction to capture the semantic meaning and context of customer expressions. The proposed method integrates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with an Attention-based Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (Att-TCNN) to capture contextual and temporal features in customer communication. The system uses BERT to understand customer language and track behavioral patterns by extracting contextual word representations and processing them through temporal convolution layers enhanced with attention, focusing on relevant text sequence parts. This hybrid BERT-Att-TCNN approach supports sentiment classification, topic identification, and engagement prediction, delivering personalized, adaptive, and real-time customer engagement in power marketing. Python was used to implement and train the model efficiently. Results from experimental evaluation demonstrate that the proposed BERT-Att-TCNN model achieved performance metrics ranging from 90 to 96%, highlighting the model’s robustness and reliability compared to traditional NLP models.

Although current dance posture estimation technologies have made some progress, there are still deficiencies in the accurate capture of three-dimensional spatial information and real-time analysis of dynamic postures. This study addresses the limitations of existing technologies and proposes a new method combining YOLO-V3 with a cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN), aimed at improving the accuracy and real-time performance of dance motion capture in VR environments. This paper proposes an innovative three-dimensional dance pose estimation algorithm that combines YOLO-V3-based human localization with three-dimensional cropping technology and a three-stage cascaded CNN system to significantly improve the precision and accuracy of dance poses in VR environments. The method demonstrates its superiority in generating accurate human models and handling real-world data by optimizing pre-trained weights and combining synthetic and real datasets. A series of experimental verifications demonstrate that both technologies significantly improve the accuracy and real-time feedback capabilities of dance motion analysis, showcasing potential applications in the fusion of art and technology.

The critical challenge in this method lies in accurately identifying the arrival time of the travelling wave signals. To address this, two different wavelet basis functions were selected to process the travelling wave signals, and their effectiveness in processing the same fault at different locations was compared and analyzed. The results show that the db4 wavelet better retains the original signal features. The error range for the Haar wavelet was 0.4289–0.6948 km, while for the db4 wavelet it was 0.0301–0.2960 km. Thus, the db4 wavelet provides more accurate ranging than the Haar wavelet.},

  abstract = {Property engineering project management is faced with increasingly complex risks and challenges. If these risks are not effectively controlled, it is easy to lead to cost overruns, time delays and even project failures. This study proposes a property engineering construction safety risk assessment method based on the IT2FS-MARCOS method to address the uncertainty of risk assessment caused by the subjectivity of expert decision-making and the problem of considering multiple risk factors under different risk parameter weights. A property engineering construction safety risk indicator evaluation system was constructed, and the combination of the G1 weighting method and the objective weighting method (CRITIC) was used to analyze the weights of each risk indicator. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) were introduced to improve the compromise-based alternative ranking method (MARCOS) in multicriteria decision-making. The utility function values of each risk factor were calculated, and the construction safety risk factors of property engineering projects were analyzed and evaluated based on the utility function values. The findings reveal the dynamic process of construction risks in property engineering projects. The model not only considers the fuzziness of expert evaluation but also adopts a multicriteria decision-making method to avoid simple weighting of risk parameters. This method has a high degree of fit with engineering practice and provides a new approach of handling risk assessment in uncertain information of property engineering.},

  abstract = {Under corporate crises, the formation of credit relationships based on group-level credit reciprocity strategies is a multi-factorial phenomenon. From the perspective of a fully mixed corporate group, the research explores the inadequacy of traditional snowdrift game models in adapting to the structural elements of credit relationship formation. Firstly, it improves the model by introducing inter-temporal costs, benefits, and crisis randomness of credit reciprocity as decision parameters. Secondly, it introduces inter-temporal credit reciprocity as a condition to allow the snowdrift game model to express the evolution between corporate groups. Finally, based on credit reciprocity, the mechanism of credit relationship formation is verified through numerical simulations. The results show that under the crisis probability, the formation of credit relationships exhibits a “threshold trigger,” and the inter-firm assistance and crisis probability play an important role in establishing credit relationships between enterprises.},

Through cross-validation, this paper selects the optimal adjustment parameters, constructs a penalized logistic regression model, and compares it with the standard logistic regression model. Research has shown that the MCP penalty logistic regression model performs the best in accuracy (89.6 ± 0.8%), F1 score (0.852), AUC value (0.918), and other aspects, outperforming the standard logistic regression model and other penalty logistic regression models. The MCP model identified 15 important financial indicators that have a significant predictive effect on the company’s financial crisis. Overall, the financial crisis warning model combined with MCP penalty logistic regression performs well in prediction accuracy and variable selection ability, providing an effective financial crisis warning tool for enterprises.},

As grid systems become more sophisticated and complex, there is an increased need for digital asset management and automation to make operations more efficient. A lot of standard grid management techniques include manual physical inspection and repair of assets. These methods tend to take too long and raise operational costs. The proposed project will improve the grid management methods by employing both digital asset feature identification and automation. The intention is to promote greater operational efficiency through automation identified through real-time monitoring of decision-making processes. The proposed process will include identifying digital maintenance features on grid assets, including transformers, electricity lines, and meters, using IoT sensors. To standardize the input values, the data is pre-processed with procedures such as z-score normalization. Features including voltage, temperature, and current are extracted using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units with Grid Search Optimization (AttenBi-GRU-GSO) method are used to analyze the processed data to predict the faults and optimize performance. The AttenBi-GRU-GSO combines the attention mechanism to focus on critical features, Bi-GRU to capture sequential dependencies from both past and future, and GSO to fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters for optimal performance, ensuring efficient and accurate fault detection and prediction in grid management. Experimental results demonstrate that the AttenBi-GRU-GSO method achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 95.31%, an MAE loss of 0.11, a total loss of 0.07, and an RMSE loss of 0.03. Automated systems provide control of detected problems by responding with remedial actions, including rerouting power and organizing maintenance. The automation increases the accuracy and speed of fault detection, as well as reduces downtime and maintenance costs.

However, traditional recommendation systems face user diversity and information overload, driving the search for more intelligent and adaptable solutions. Therefore, a multi-recommendation model for e-commerce is proposed by integrating backpropagation algorithm and genetic algorithm. The backpropagation algorithm is used to learn user historical behavior data and establish an initial recommendation model. Then, the genetic algorithm is applied to evolve and optimize the model to meet the personalized needs. Through continuous iteration and evolution, the recommendation model can better capture the potential interests and behavioral patterns of users. The proposed method reached the target value after 51 iterations, which was significantly faster than that of the pre-optimized model. The latter reached the standard after 100 iterations. In terms of error, the highest value was 43, with an average of about 15, while the highest value of the optimized network was only 40, with an average of about 12. Therefore, the optimized network performed significantly better than the pre-optimized network.

The study specifically examines underground mining personnel across four high-risk operational roles, employing a randomized controlled trial design with validated psychological empowerment measures based on established empowerment and social cognitive theories. The results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in all safety metrics evaluated, with the greatest gains in correct identification of threats (experimental group: 82.5% vs control group: 52.6%) and response times to integrated physical-digital threats (41.5% faster).

  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of educational technology, the complexity of attention allocation among university students in information-rich learning environments has significantly increased. Effective attention allocation is crucial for learning outcomes; however, traditional research methods face limitations in capturing and analyzing dynamically changing cognitive processes. This study aims to utilize neural network technology, particularly the model based on Time-series generative adversarial network (TimeGAN), to identify and analyze the patterns of attention allocation in university students’ cognitive processes. The TimeGAN model, selected for its proficiency in handling time-series data, is employed to reveal the dynamic shifts of attention across various tasks and states. The second part introduces a novel framework that combines a Customized Gate Control (CGC) model with a progressive hierarchical extraction model, aiming to more accurately simulate the management of attention switching in a multitasking environment. These approaches enhance the model’s adaptability to individual differences, offering support for the formulation of personalized learning strategies. Not only does this research expand the application of computational models in the field of educational psychology, but it also provides new theoretical foundations and practical tools for optimizing teaching designs and promoting cognitive development among students.},

  abstract = {In response to the problem of insufficient adaptability of parameterized learning in local observation graph signal scenes in multi-task learning scenarios, a graph signal processing technique for multi-task scenarios is studied and introduced. In this technology, the research is based on the improved diffusion least mean square algorithm for clustering sampling, using different graph filters to train parameters and a clustering strategy to complete sampling. In addition, a multi-task power grid voltage graph signal detection technique with improved high pass filtering is proposed, and power grid data security detection is achieved through threshold setting and projection detection. In the analysis of graph signal processing, the research model has better steady-state learning performance. For example, in the transient mean square deviation test of multitasking scenarios, its convergence value is −31.25 dB, which is better than similar models. In the single-task transient mean square deviation test, the research model is closer to the reference standard, with a convergence value of −34.25 dB and better learning ability. In power application analysis, the research model performs better in graph signal detection, such as in voltage amplitude scenarios where the maximum detection probability is 100%. In the voltage angle scenario, when the voltage angle is higher than ±−2°, the detection probability of the research model is higher than 92.25%. It can be seen that the technology proposed by the research has excellent application effects.

Conventional forecasting models struggle with accuracy, scalability, and robust optimization, especially when dealing with non-linear, high-dimensional energy datasets. Moreover, they lack adaptability to volatile demand–supply dynamics and real-time operational constraints. This research presents a next-generation intelligent platform that integrates a Weighted Golden Eagle Optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (WGEO-LightGBM) for predictive modeling and operational optimization in electricity marketing and service delivery. Data is collected from IoT-based smart meters and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, encompassing load demand, pricing signals, and historical consumption trends. The collected data were preprocessed using missing value imputation, Min-Max scaling, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to enhance model input quality and reduce feature redundancy. The WGE algorithm enhances the search efficiency and solution diversity by adaptively adjusting flight dynamics and prey targeting mechanisms. LightGBM, a fast, scalable regression model, is used for short-term load forecasting and price prediction, enabling real-time pricing, demand-side management, efficient service delivery, and resource allocation. The WGEO-LightGBM model predicted load values ranging from approximately 120 MW–160 MW across multiple hourly intervals, closely aligning with actual observations and demonstrating its precision in dynamic grid environments. Its integration into intelligent platforms offers scalable, data-driven solutions for real-time energy management and improved service delivery.},

In order to find the potential relationship between students’ learning behavior and academic performance from complex teaching data and provide better teaching solutions for educators, this paper used the Apriori algorithm to mine association rules in educational data. This study collected learning data from 5000 students in their first to third year of high school from a key higher education institution and a non-key higher education institution. Through data preprocessing and transformation, the optimized Apriori algorithm was used for frequent itemset mining, and four main learning behavior patterns were identified: online discussion, completing assignments on time, classroom participation, and additional reading. The experimental results show that the optimized algorithm reduces the execution time by 32% from 12.5 seconds before optimization to 8.5 seconds after optimization when processing the same amount of data. The performance of the optimized algorithm is stable when processing large-scale data. As the amount of data increases, the running time of the algorithm steadily increases from 2.4 seconds to 15.0 seconds, and the number of frequent itemsets gradually increases from 48 to 270. Research has found a significant correlation between frequent participation in online discussions and timely completion of assignments with student performance, particularly among students who attend regularly and have a higher Grade Point Average (GPA), with support and confidence levels of 0.22 and 0.85, respectively.

  abstract = {The rapid advancement in educational technology has ushered in an era where multimodal learning environments are increasingly recognized as crucial for fostering students’ cognitive and emotional development. This research explores the dual impact of these environments, integrating diverse sensory information, including visual and auditory inputs, thus offering enriched learning experiences with potential influences on students’ cognitive and emotional states. A notable gap in current research is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how multimodal learning environments distinctly affect these aspects of student development. Traditional methodologies in this field often fail to account for the dynamic nature and individual variances inherent in the learning process, thereby limiting the depth of insights into the influence mechanisms of these environments. To bridge these gaps, this study employs a dual-methodological approach. Firstly, a sophisticated correlation matrix is developed to diagnose cognitive development within multimodal learning environments, effectively identifying key factors in cognitive processes. Secondly, an innovative emotion recognition model is utilized, incorporating sensor feature embedding and temporal feature embedding techniques, to adeptly capture students’ emotional fluctuations within these settings. The findings from this study provide substantial implications for educational practice. They enable educators to enhance the design and optimization of learning environments, promoting not only cognitive growth but also emotional well-being among students. This approach underscores the importance of addressing both cognitive and emotional domains in educational settings to foster holistic development. This study innovatively establishes a matrix correlating students, learning items, and knowledge points, facilitating a joint analysis to diagnose the cognitive development mechanism within multimodal learning environments. Additionally, an emotion recognition model, combining both sensor and temporal feature embedding networks, has been constructed. This model accurately identifies and analyzes students’ emotional states. The primary contribution lies in providing a comprehensive method for evaluating both cognitive and emotional states of students, which aids in optimizing personalized learning strategies and enhancing educational outcomes.},

The fingerprint feature encryption algorithm is introduced. Dynamic keys are generated through the translation, rotation, and scaling transformations of biometric feature points, forming double-layer encryption with the improved RC4 algorithm to achieve secure storage and access control of data. Experiments show that in the multi-source archive image test, the average MSE value of the model is 28.56 and the PSNR value is 32.45, which improves the noise suppression ability by 15.3% compared with the traditional median filtering algorithm. Facing complex scenarios, the decoding rates reached 87.33% and 92.11%, respectively, and the positioning accuracy rate reached 97.38%. Under the FGSM attack, the decoding rate of the model remained at 100%, and the EER value was only 0.92%. The above results prove that the proposed model has better encryption performance.

The results show that 74% of the people support the use of multi-dimensional intelligent software in curriculum reform. However, 40% of them believe that they do not have enough technical proficiency in familiarizing themselves with the software itself. As a result, their willingness to recommend the digital software they have used to others is not high.

  abstract = {Traditional equipment manufacturing training methods face many problems, such as high resource consumption, high safety risks, time and space limitations, difficulty in personalized teaching, and incomplete evaluation. This article aims to develop an intelligent international equipment manufacturing training platform by combining deep learning and virtual reality (VR) technology to address these issues. Firstly, the virtual reality technology was utilized to create immersive virtual environments, reducing reliance on physical equipment and venues, lowering costs and resource consumption, while eliminating security risks in real operations. Students could conduct practical training anytime and anywhere in a virtual environment, overcoming the limitations of traditional training in terms of time and space, and enhancing the flexibility and convenience of learning. Then, through deep learning algorithms CNN (convolutional neural network) and RNN (recurrent neural network), the platform could analyze students’ operational data in real-time and provide personalized feedback and guidance. The teaching content and difficulty were adjusted according to the learning progress and performance of the students, ensuring that each student can have a suitable learning experience. In addition, deep learning algorithms could automatically evaluate students’ operational skills and learning effectiveness, and generate detailed evaluation reports, making the evaluation process more objective and fair, and avoiding the influence of subjective factors. The training platform developed in this article could also simulate complex equipment manufacturing scenarios and troubleshooting processes, allowing students to significantly improve their scores in operational accuracy, efficiency, fault recognition ability, and problem-solving ability. The average improvement percentage of students in various evaluation indicators was about 43.83%. Through the development and evaluation of this platform, this article aims to significantly improve the efficiency, safety, and learning effectiveness of equipment manufacturing training, providing an innovative solution for international equipment manufacturing training.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effects of the Tactical Programme for Critical Thinking (TPCT) on tactical performance and critical thinking (CT) in elite male underwater rugby (UWR) players. Twenty-four experienced players (mean age: 29.38 ± 7.11 years; playing experience: 10.86 ± 4.82 years) were randomly assigned to either a control (STR) or experimental (TPCT) group. Both followed identical physical, technical, and tactical training standards. Over 20 sessions (two per week), the TPCT group trained through core tactical principles of UWR, integrating guided reflection and collaborative decision-making to promote critical engagement with in-game situations. Tactical performance was evaluated using RUSTAC (Rugby Underwater Tactical Assessment Criteria), a validated observational tool developed for UWR that codes behaviours during game sequences, including spatial occupation, decision timing, and role consistency in both offensive and defensive phases. CT skills were measured using the Critical Thinking Measurement Index. Results showed that TPCT participants significantly improved tactical performance (p = 0.017; d = 0.81), while the STR group showed no significant changes. Both groups experienced slight, non-significant improvements in CT. These findings suggest TPCT may be effective for enhancing tactical performance in elite UWR athletes, although its direct effect on measurable CT remains inconclusive. Further longitudinal studies with larger samples are encouraged to assess the sustained cognitive impact of TPCT and its integration into high-performance settings. Practically, coaches may consider incorporating structured reflection and tactical questioning into training to deepen understanding and support decision-making under pressure.

Mixed-methods scrutiny of roughly 2400 posts drawn from eight service providers forms the evidential core of the project. China’s social environments lean heavily towards visual artistry—more than 42% of the data, by one estimate—and produce formal novelties at an impressive 63% clip. Russian spaces, in contrast, foreground century-old stories, with nearly 41% of the corpus devoted to such materials, and score 54% on an informal semantic-adaptation metric. Hybrid cultural mixes are on the rise: China’s proportion jumped from 42 to 69% between 2020 and early 2024, while Russia’s climbed from 38 to just over 52% in the same window. Content rooted in tradition outlasts its contemporary cousins by a wide margin, attracting average user attention for just over 7 days in Chinese streams and for roughly 9 days in Russian ones; the shorter lifespan of modern posts hovers around 3 days in both contexts. Engagement styles diverge, too: Chinese users tend to share posts at a 39% rate, whereas Russian cohorts favor commenting, which they do at close to 43%. Taken together, the observations chart culturally specific pathways of digital adaptation that preserve core identities and introduce a Cultural Resilience Index as a new methodological benchmark.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a secure food quality traceability system based on a multi-chain blockchain architecture to improve both data protection and the efficiency of food quality management. The system leverages blockchain technology to monitor and safeguard the entire supply chain—including production, processing, and transportation. To ensure confidentiality and integrity of data, the system integrates the Paillier encryption algorithm and secure hash algorithms for encrypted storage and secure sharing (the Paillier algorithm supports addition and multiplication operations, making it suitable for handling data aggregation and analysis tasks in the supply chain. It has high computational efficiency and can quickly complete data encryption and decryption). Hyperledger Fabric is employed to manage permissioned access, enforce data query control, and mitigate unauthorized operations. Security tests indicate that the system achieves high encryption efficiency—encrypting 2500 kb of data in 22 ms with a 32-bit key and achieving the fastest decryption at 443 ms with a 128-bit key. Compared to traditional systems, it significantly improves throughput (412 TPS vs 305 TPS) and risk interception (92 vs 52). These results demonstrate that the proposed system enhances cybersecurity in traceability applications by offering strong encryption, fine-grained access control, and high performance. It provides a robust and scalable solution for securing sensitive data in food supply chains, with broader implications for blockchain-based cybersecurity applications in industrial networks.},

  abstract = {This research carried out the durability assessment of manufactured sand concrete under the combined effects of stray current and chloride ions. Experiments demonstrated that manufactured sand concrete resists chloride ion penetration 15%–25% more than natural sand concrete does, with the best performance registered at 6.4% stone powder content. Stray current causes the electromigration effect which causes chloride ion migration to be more rapid. The depth of chloride penetration is about 30% greater when 10 V is supplied compared to 40 V. COMSOL Multiphysics-based numerical simulations (a finite element analysis software) showed that the irregular morphology of manufactured sand particles increases the transport paths of chloride ions, creating a “tortuosity effect” with a value of 1.35. This value is higher than that of natural sand, which is 1.22, and the circular aggregate models, which is 1.15. At the same time, the stone powder filling effect reduces the porosity of concrete. The simulation results accurately matched the experimental data by more than 90% for the early stage of corrosion. This research offers theoretical evidence for the feasibility of manufactured sand concrete applications in coastal metro engineering and shows its best performance under severe conditions of stray current and chloride exposure. The use of manufactured sand provides significant sustainability benefits by reducing natural sand depletion and environmental impact while maintaining superior durability performance.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of portable electronic devices, the demand for 12-bit low-power analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chips continues to grow. Considering that these devices typically rely on battery power, high precision and stability are crucial. In order to improve the voltage resistance of ADC chips under high voltage, an innovative bootstrap sampling switch design is proposed, which utilizes the capacitance characteristics of NMOS and PMOS transistors to enhance the voltage resistance of the chip. At the same time, considering factors such as power fluctuations, time domain and voltage interleaving, a two-stage hybrid architecture based on successive approximation registers (SARs) and time to digital converters (TDCs) was studied and designed to optimize the balance between low power consumption and high voltage resistance performance. The results showed that the power consumption of the chip design was only 9.5 mW. The voltage compensation measures significantly reduced the error value from 7.01% to 1.97%, optimizing 5.04%. In summary, this design not only improves the accuracy and speed of ADC chips, but also successfully controls the exponential growth of power consumption, which has strong practical value. The proposed solution by the research institute has broad potential in multiple application fields, especially suitable for situations with high requirements for power consumption and stability, such as medical imaging and aerospace. This design provides new ideas and directions for the development of high-performance and low-power ADC chips in the future.},

  abstract = {Amidst profound transformations witnessed in the contemporary occupational landscape, precipitated by persistent forces of globalization and digitalization, an urgent emergence of the need for a comprehensive array of adaptive skills has been observed. Addressing this imperative, the merging of vocational education and lifelong learning is deemed essential, emerging as a cornerstone in contemporary educational discourse. Though the import of adaptive skills is universally acknowledged, the means to impart such training effectively remains elusive. Present technological strategies reveal shortcomings in provisioning individualized learning experiences and in extracting semantic information from textual content. Through the current investigation, a strategy is introduced whereby adaptive skills are fortified via intelligent recommendations, in tandem with an optimized Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network structure, aiming for an incisive classification of adaptive skill training texts. Such strategies not only delineate a fresh theoretical paradigm for adaptive skill instruction but also proffer cutting-edge technical reinforcement for the intertwined realms of vocational education and lifelong learning. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of an adaptive skill enhancement method based on intelligent recommendation and the design of an intelligent test item recommendation algorithm for adaptive skill enhancement. Additionally, the research introduces innovative improvements to the LSTM network structure by incorporating thematic semantic information, enabling the model to generate more accurate text representations, thereby significantly improving classification performance and the accuracy of personalized recommendations. These contributions provide effective technical support for enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive skill training.},

Our Machine–Readable Co-design (MaRC) toolkit, a CE method, leverages human–machine teaming to address the collection and analysis of community stories at scale in CBPR. MaRC integrates AI/ML technologies to support effective community co-planning. In this study, two researchers used MaRC to capture and analyze over 100 community stories. While researchers spent over 120 hr across 2 months manually measuring and recording data, MaRC computed each story within 8 to 10 minutes, achieving an 84% concordance rate with our manual, baseline analysis.

Moreover, this study proposes an innovative diarticulation model, which quantifies the co-articulation effect through a consonant-vowel/vowel-vowel visual weight function and optimizes the mouth shape parameters through a dynamic feedback mechanism. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the recognition performance of the model, with an F1 value of 0.91 and a domain matching dataset CER of 6–8.5%. The pronunciation correction effect is outstanding, with a 43% reduction in vowel error rate (23.1% → 13.2%) and a 38.5% improvement in consonant connection accuracy.

  abstract = {With the growth of the film market, users are often overwhelmed by irrelevant information, making it difficult to make accurate movie choices. To address this, we propose an improved deep structured semantic model (DSSM) movie recommendation algorithm based on Spark technology. The algorithm employs two DSSMs: one to extract users’ long-term preferences and another for final movie recommendations. The preference model integrates explicit and implicit user interaction features, while the recommendation model utilizes recent viewing history and search behavior. Experiments were conducted on the MovieLens 100K and MovieLens 1M datasets, using metrics such as accuracy, recall, mean reciprocal ranking (MRR), diversity, and normalized discounted cumulative return (NDCG). The results show that the improved algorithm outperforms others in recall, with rates of 36.0% and 42.1% for the top 40 recommendations on the MovieLens 100K and 1M datasets, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm’s NDCG scores for the top 10 recommendations were 0.525 and 0.554, higher than those of competing algorithms. The system, built on Spark technology, passes all performance tests, with an average response time of under 600 ms. These results demonstrate that the proposed DSSM-based movie recommendation algorithm can provide accurate recommendations while overcoming the challenge of data sparsity. The research not only provides an efficient and accurate solution for the field of movie recommendation, but also shows the significant advantages of Spark technology in processing large-scale data sets, which has a wide range of application value and promotion prospects.},

  abstract = {Objective:
            The new drug KarXT targets muscarinic receptors to reduce the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Haloperidol is effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, while sulpiride has shown modest efficacy in alleviating negative symptoms. The shared and distinct molecular mechanisms of these drugs are unclear. This study aimed to determine if the mechanism for KarXT overlaps with the benefits of haloperidol for positive symptoms and sulpiride for negative symptoms.
          
          
            Methods:
            The putative target genes for the three drugs were identified, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify core targets. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses of the top 20 core targets were conducted. A drug-pathway-target-disease network was constructed.
          
          
            Results:
            The search yielded 179 common targets for haloperidol against positive symptoms, 96 targets for sulpiride against negative symptoms, and 99 targets for KarXT against schizophrenia. Haloperidol affects positive symptoms by targeting the IL-17 signaling pathway via TNF, IL6, IL1B, MAPK3, and CASP3, and sulpiride affects negative symptoms by targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway via BDNF, INS, AKT1, IGF1, and BCL2. KarXT affects schizophrenia by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway via AKT1, FOS, CASP3, NFKB1, and IGF1. Molecular docking revealed good binding affinities between the drugs and the potential core targets.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            This study provides insights into the distinct molecular mechanisms by which haloperidol and sulpiride affect distinct symptoms of schizophrenia. KarXT integrates the partial effects of both drugs, including CASP3 with haloperidol and AKT1 and IGF1 with sulpiride.

  abstract = {As the demand for e-voting grows, it has become particularly important to ensure the security and fairness of the voting system. Therefore, an e-voting system is studied and designed to ensure the non-tamperability of voting results. The system utilizes zero-knowledge proof to verify the identity of the voter, while ensuring the tamperability of the voting data through blockchain technology. The experimental results indicated that the system outperformed the existing schemes in terms of processing speed and verification efficiency. Specifically, when the number of voters was 200, the time consuming and single verification time of this system were 3.7 s and 6.4 ms, respectively. When the number of voters increased to 600, the time consuming and single verification time were 8.3 s and 13.3 ms, respectively. In the number of candidates/voters was 5/80, none of the system’s gas consumption exceeded the maximum limit of a single transaction in Ether. Among them, the gas consumption of Vote Control contract was 5577485, and the gas consumption of non-interactive zero knowledge contract was 3826753. Furthermore, the more candidates there were, the longer it took the system to operate, although the number of voters had less of an effect on the cost of operating the voter system. The above outcomes reveal that the e-voting system proposed in the study provides a secure and efficient solution for small-scale voting activities and provides a basis for future optimization of large-scale voting scenarios.},

This study proposes an improved DV-Hop algorithm (IOWDV-Hop) to address this issue. The IOWDV-Hop integrates an optimal weighting function with an anchor node selection strategy. This method improves the accuracy of node localization by introducing error-minimizing weights and a constraint-based mechanism for selecting anchor nodes. Experiments were conducted using different irregular network structures for comparative testing. The results showed that the proposed algorithm performed best in a “Tˮ-shaped network.

This research examines how big data analytics can be used to improve user interactions on powerful marketing platforms. The specific goal is to improve energy efficiency, personal services and dynamic marketing techniques based on user behavior analysis. The dataset contains consumer consumption patterns, pricing information, and interaction logs. Research uses big data approaches to evaluate massive volumes of user interaction data.

Recognizing the challenges in automatic fashion style generation, particularly the lack of high-fidelity image recognition and realistic style synthesis, the research proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework named the automated fashion style generation model based on image recognition techniques. To address the identified research gap, the research introduces a novel Vision Transformer-driven Style Generative Adversarial Network (ViT-StyleGAN), aiming to transform raw fashion imagery into diverse, high-quality styles. For this research, a comprehensive dataset comprising fashion items was assembled to ensure rich stylistic diversity. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and clothing region segmentation using a Mask R-CNN variant, ensuring clean inputs for the model. Feature extraction was performed using an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder to capture detailed spatial representations. The proposed framework processes the gathered data by first extracting robust features; it is subsequently used to create innovative fashion designs using the StyleGAN-based generator. ViT-StyleGAN effectively leverages global visual context and fine-grained texture generation, optimizing outputs for realism and creativity. The ViT-StyleGAN was evaluated with the YOLOv5s models that were trained for 100 and 300 epochs.

In practical applications, the air compressor of the fuel cell system will be affected by the frequency and amplitude of changes in the air load. To effectively solve this problem, this study proposes and evaluates the control algorithm of fuel cell air compressors considering the characteristics of air load. Firstly, a control model of the fuel cell air compressor system including air load and back pressure valve model is established. Secondly, the input–output feedback linearization (IOFL) theory is adopted to globally linearize the control model of the fuel cell air compressor system. Finally, the Q-axis current of the improved speed loop is generated through the feedback of the air state quantity to correct the output torque of the air compressor.

  abstract = {Traditional online advertising evaluation indicators (e.g., click-through rate and conversion rate) are characterized by limitations in scope and delayed feedback, rendering them inadequate for real-time and comprehensive evaluation. The existing models have insufficient accuracy when fusing multiple features. Therefore, the research proposes an evaluation framework that integrates multimodal features (MF) with attribute integration for user classification and constructs a cascading model based on MF and timing features (TC). The classification of user types is achieved through the attribute integration method, which utilizes multi-source data, including cognitive styles and emotional states. Quantification of features is facilitated by employing membership functions. The cascade model involves combining Markov chains and the PrefixSpan algorithm to mine temporal patterns. The results showed that when the user type was 2, the cluster center distances were (1.3, 0.9), and the type differences were significant. Under the activation of ReLU, the Auc of the cascade model was 0.803 and the logloss was 0.45. Under tanh activation, Auc = 0.795 and logloss = 0.452. The evaluation accuracy rate of the cascade model from 18:00 to 22:00 can reach up to 0.99 at most. The studies show that this method improves the evaluation accuracy and provides technical references for the industry.},

  abstract = {Lane line boundary detection algorithms primarily rely on camera-acquired image data for accurate recognition. However, during image acquisition, distortions caused by glass refraction and the inherent imaging principles of the camera can compromise the precision of lane line detection. To enhance the precision of road environment perception, this study first conducts a comprehensive camera calibration to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, which serve as the basis for subsequent geometric distortion correction of the acquired images. Subsequently, Otsu’s method is employed for binary segmentation of lane images, and Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) is utilized to transform the perspective and extract precise lane line boundary coordinates. The eight-neighborhood boundary tracking algorithm is then employed to track lane lines, improving image processing speed while reducing false positives and false negatives. Finally, the Least Squares Method is utilized to fit the extracted boundary points of the lane lines, thereby constructing an accurate mathematical model for lane representation. The experiment was conducted using multi-element lane lines as the test platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves nearly a fivefold improvement in detection speed compared to the method without inverse perspective transformation. The Intersection over Union (IoU) between the extracted lane lines and the ground truth reaches 0.88, approaching the ideal value of 1.0. The pixel-level accuracy of lane line extraction is 93.7%, and the recall rate, representing the proportion of correctly extracted lane line pixels, is 95.2%. Furthermore, the balanced F1-score, which evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall, reaches 0.98, indicating excellent overall performance. Additionally, it exhibited superior robustness. These findings suggest that this method can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lane line detection in complex road environments, thereby providing reliable technical support for intelligent driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).},

This research explores the neurocognitive enhancements induced by VR-based English phoneme learning through multimodal bio-signal analysis and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. A total of 450 English learners participated in immersive VR scenarios designed to target challenging English phonemes within authentic conversational tasks. Two types of datasets were collected: one in the form of a CSV file containing EEG signals and eye-tracking data, and the other comprising audio signal data. EEG and eye-tracking data were preprocessed using Z-score normalization to ensure consistency. Audio data were denoised using the Savitzky–Golay filter, which effectively preserves phonetic information while removing environmental noise. The cleaned data were fed into the feature extraction process. For the EEG and eye-tracking data, feature extraction was carried out using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), while Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the audio data to capture detailed phonetic features essential for phoneme classification. This approach ensures accurate classification of phonemic performance and prediction of neurocognitive load in immersive VR-based phoneme learning. A feature-level fusion technique was employed to integrate the normalized event-log features and audio-based MFCCs into a unified, high-dimensional feature space, enabling comprehensive multimodal analysis. The Manta Ray Foraging Optimized Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (MRFO-LGBM) was introduced to optimize the LGBM model, enabling accurate classification of phonemic performance and prediction of neurocognitive load.

Yet, academic programs comprising structured offerings like degrees, diplomas, and certificates frequently face challenges in adapting promptly to the changing demands of the labor market. This lag often leads to a sustained disconnect between the skills students acquire and those sought by employers. To address this challenge, this research introduces an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven framework that leverages a Spatially-Aware Attention Long Short-Term Memory (SA-LSTM) architecture to harmonize academic curriculum with labor market trends. The framework processes two primary datasets: academic data, including curriculum outlines, course descriptions, student performance records, and labor market data, derived from online job postings, government employment reports, and industry white papers. The data undergoes a rigorous pre-processing pipeline, including cleaning, tokenization, and embedding using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to extract relevant features and feature-level fusion combines the features. The SA-LSTM model is the core of the system, incorporating spatial attention mechanisms to identify and model curriculum content and shifting skill requirements in the labor market. By leveraging the use of the attention mechanism, the model identifies contextual constraints in academic content and labor market trends to enable the identification of gaps in skills and new industry requirements. The SA-LSTM model generates curriculum recommendations from these results, suggesting new course modules, course modifications, and has better performance in accuracy with 96.2%, in comparison to baseline methods.

Effective asset prioritization and disposal planning are critical to maintaining system reliability, minimizing operational risks, and optimizing financial performance. This research introduces a robust data-driven framework for asset prioritization and disposal planning by integrating advanced analytics and optimization techniques. Diverse datasets are collected, including asset condition reports, maintenance logs, operational performance data, failure records, and environmental parameters. Data preprocessing uses Z-score normalization to scale numerical features and handle anomalies, while missing values are treated using appropriate imputation methods to maintain dataset integrity. Asset prioritization is assessed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), enabling structured multi-criteria decision-making based on factors such as failure impact, maintenance cost, and system importance. Natural Gradient Boosting (NGB) is employed to forecast asset degradation and estimate failure probability and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with high accuracy. These predictive insights formed the basis for prioritizing assets for replacement or disposal. A Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) is developed to optimize disposal schedules and support long-term planning within operational and financial constraints. This approach balances budget limitations with criticality and RUL outputs to generate efficient replacement strategies. Integrating AHP, NGB, and PGA within a unified decision-support system highlights the potential of hybrid analytical models in modernizing public infrastructure management. The results show that the hybrid approach performs significantly better than traditional approaches in terms of System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI). This approach supports proactive maintenance, reduces systemic risks, and enhances the overall resilience and performance of power distribution networks.},

To address this issue, this article proposed a choir sound balance optimization model based on simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The experiment included sound data collection, environmental characteristic measurement, and evaluation index setting, which verified the effectiveness of this method in dealing with different voice parts and complex environmental factors. The outcomes demonstrated that the simulated annealing algorithm significantly reduced the standard deviation of the volume and frequency of each voice and improved the balance of the volume and frequency. In all scenarios, the volume standard deviation of the simulated annealing adjustment method was smaller or equal to the standard deviation of the conventional adjustment method. The standard deviation of the simulated annealing adjustment method was always the lowest among all voice parts and time windows. The average frequency standard deviation of the four voice parts decreased by 51.21% and 31.70% in indoor environments, 52.10% and 30.96% in semi-open environments, and 49.25% and 29.49% in outdoor environments, respectively. The subjective evaluation results of users further verified the effectiveness of the model, and various listeners gave high ratings to the adjusted volume balance and overall sound quality. This indicates that the method has broad application potential and can cope with diverse practical performance environments. The research results of this article provide a scientific sound balance optimization tool for choir groups, which can help choir conductors and sound engineers achieve higher levels of sound balance and harmony in actual performances.},

  abstract = {Image emotion classification technology has been widely applied in fields such as social media. How to accurately extract emotional information from numerous images has become an essential issue in computer vision. To achieve high-precision image emotion classification, this study proposes a polarity-aware attention mechanism for both negative and positive coarse-grained sentiment classifications. Among them, polarity perception refers to the perception and classification of the binary polarity (positive/negative) of image emotions, while supporting fine-grained emotional intensity evaluation. At the same time, a classification network combining polarity-aware attention module and Transformer is introduced to achieve fine-grained emotion classification containing eight emotions. The results showed that the proposed polarity-aware attention mechanism classification method had an average accuracy of 95.88%, an average recall rate of 94.94%, and an average F1-value of 95.62% on the Twitter I binary sentiment classification dataset. In the ArtPhoto eight emotion classification datasets, the fusion of polarity-aware attention module and Transformer classification network achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.23% and the lowest accuracy of 96.14% for the eight emotions. The highest classification accuracy of the weighted spatial context network was only 89.01%. The results indicate that the proposed image sentiment classification technique has achieved significant performance advantages in both coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification tasks. The study provides important methodological support for applications in multiple fields including social media and sentiment computing.},

            H-NMR spectroscopy were used to identify the produced compounds. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was employed to examine the lipophilicity of the silylated derivatives of piroxicam. Due to the non-polar nature of the column used in this device and the polarity of piroxicam and its derivatives, the retention time of silylated derivatives was longer in the column compared to the original piroxicam, due to the inherent nature of these materials which have high non polar properties. The results show an acceptable increase in the lipophilicity of the silylated derivatives compared to piroxicam. To evaluate the hydrophobic properties of drugs e.g., piroxicam and the silyl derivatives of piroxicam, the distribution of the species around the drugs were investigated in a Water/Octanol mixture using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Results of the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and continuous hydrogen bond networks suggest a favorable interaction between Octanol molecules and the silyl derivatives of piroxicam compared to piroxicam.},

Firstly, RepConv and DBB reparameterization modules are introduced to enhance the ability of multi-scale feature fusion and solve the problem of large scale difference of visual objects. A centralized intra-layer adjustment feature pyramid network is designed, which combines the deformable attention mechanism and CASPPF in a parallel way. The pyramid network is globally centralized adjusted in a top–down manner, and the spatial weight of the global representation in the network is increased, so that the improved algorithm can obtain comprehensive and discriminative feature representation. The cross-entropy loss function is replaced by the exponential sliding sample weighting function (EMA‐SlideLoss) to enhance the classification ability of the model and improve the stability of training. Using these methods, we propose an improved model RDE-YOLOv8-Pose model. The experimental results show that compared with the YOLOv8-Pose model, this research method improves mAP@0.5 by 0.142 and achieves a detection speed of 47.4 frames/s. This study can effectively improve the motion capture ability of artificial intelligence methods for soccer players, and provide more efficient and accurate technical support for intelligent monitoring of sports events and auxiliary referee decision-making.},

This study conducts numerical simulations on L-shaped frames subjected to frequent earthquakes to investigate the influence of low-frequency content on the torsional responses of planar irregular frame structures (PIFSs). Five L-shaped frame models with varying length-to-width ratios (L/B) of the protruding limbs-1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, and 3:1 were developed using ABAQUS. Columns were modeled using solid elements, reinforcing steel with truss elements, and floor slabs with shell elements. The peak shear forces and bending moments in corner columns were compared under various conditions of low-frequency content to analyze the effects of low-frequency content and L/B ratios on wave passage effect in frames. The results indicate that when the low-frequency content of seismic waves is sufficient, wave passage effect occurs in outer corner columns, whereas inner corner columns remain unaffected. At apparent wave velocity of 2000 m/s, increasing L/B ratios amplify peak shear forces and bending moments in wave-facing outer corner columns by 28.3% and 43.8%, respectively.

  abstract = {In this study, we present a new multimodal subtitle translating system integrating a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based syntactic error correcting mechanism. To produce accurate and fluid subtitles, our system aggregates text, video, and audio inputs. The grammar error correction system based on GRNN finds and fixes syntactic mistakes in the translated subtitles, therefore raising their general quality. Our testing findings reveal notable increases in subtitle translating accuracy and fluency of the proposed method. With a translation accuracy of 92.5%, the proposed method beats the baseline by 10.2%. By means of a 95.1% syntax error correction accuracy, the GRNN-based syntax error correction system lowers the syntax error rate by 70.5% Our method achieves a fluency score of 4.8/5.0, compared to 4.2/5.0 for the baseline technique, therefore improving the fluency of the translated subtitles. With a BLEU score of 0.85, our method shows great degree of similarity between the reference and translated subtitles. In all measures—including BLEU score, translation accuracy, syntax error correction accuracy, and fluency score—the DE-GRNN-based technique beats the GRNN-based method. The results show 8.2% increase in BLEU score, indicating improved subtitle quality, 2.9% increase in translation accuracy, showing better correctness, 3.6% increase in syntax error correction accuracy, indicating improved subtitle accuracy and 2.1% increase in fluency score, so indicating naturalism and readability. The findings show how well the proposed method generates correct, fluid, syntactic error-free subtitles.},

  abstract = {In martial arts action recognition, complex poses, occlusions, and dynamic changes can lead to insufficient estimation accuracy, and traditional methods suffer from inaccurate joint localization and poor recognition of continuous pose jumps. In response to this, the research proposes the Dilated Convolution-Attention-Stacked Hourglass Network Pose Estimation (MS-DConv-Att-SHN) to achieve martial arts action recognition. Firstly, multiple dilated convolutions and mixed attention are proposed to improve the computational complexity and loss of joint information in stacked hourglass networks, enhancing the ability to capture subtle joint displacements. This is crucial for accurate estimation of complex poses such as movement, flicker, and virtual real transformations in martial arts. Secondly, in response to the strong coherence of martial arts movements, local feature refinement and channel fusion techniques are used to enhance the correlation analysis between consecutive action frames, solving the problem of traditional methods’ fragmented recognition of action chains such as “exertion contraction.” A martial arts action recognition system based on the improved MS-DConv-Att-SHN method has been developed to better identify individual movements and capture the intrinsic relationships between movements in routines. This provides key technical support for the digital inheritance, intelligent evaluation, and standardized promotion of martial arts, making it more closely aligned with the movement characteristics of martial arts that combine form and spirit. The results indicate that structural improvements to the stacked hourglass network can effectively increase its percentage of correct keypoints (PCK) and mean average precision (mAP) for both datasets, with PCK and mAP values exceeding 92% and 85%, respectively. The average recognition accuracy of attitude keypoints in the MS-DConv-Att-SHN model is superior to other comparison models, with a difference of over 1.2% compared to other models. The improved MS-DConv-Att-SHN model achieves recognition accuracy of over 90% for different martial arts movements, showing smaller parameter counts and PCK values compared to other comparative models. The research method can effectively provide technical support for the automation analysis of martial arts movements, sports training assistance systems, and intelligent martial arts teaching.},

In the results, the multi-modal model showed significantly higher accuracy and F1 score in detecting false news than the unimodal model. Its accuracy and F1 score improved by an average of 7.57% and 7.34% on the POL and GOS datasets, and 7.20% and 6.38% on the WEIBO and TWITTER datasets. In addition, hyperparameter analysis showed that the model performance reached its optimum when the parameters r and k were adjusted to their optimal values. The ablation experiment further validated the importance of the channel attention mechanism and graph comparison method in improving model performance. The results indicate that multi-modal models have significant advantages in detecting false news and can effectively utilize information from different modalities to improve detection accuracy. This study is meaningful for evaluating the reliability of false news information and the media’s credibility in society.

This study utilizes microwave transmission technology to measure the complex dielectric constant of grain and establishes a calculation model linking grain density and dielectric constant, offering a feasible approach for detecting the average density of grain piles. To address the “underdetermination” issue in identifying anomalies using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) echoes, a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation model of the granary detection environment is developed.

The proposed model preprocesses historical classroom data through feature correlation analysis and PCA-based dimensionality reduction, followed by K-medoids clustering to improve data structure and training efficiency. It then takes Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to enhance the input representation of the LSTM model. Experimental results demonstrated that the improved CNN-LSTM achieved an F1 value of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.11 with 1000 training samples, significantly outperforming baseline models including CNN, LSTM, and GRNN.

By analyzing two distinct scenarios—one with a small damping coefficient (β = 0.01) and the other with a larger damping coefficient (β = 0.5)—we observe that the damping parameter significantly influences system behavior. Specifically, in the first scenario, the system exhibits stable damped harmonic motion with constant energy, while in the second scenario, the system experiences energy dissipation and becomes unstable. This study highlights the critical role of damping in determining the system’s stability and energy dissipation, showcasing the effectiveness of both MS-DTM and numerical methods in analyzing nonlinear oscillatory systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the regional double-layer indoor high-precision positioning system based on Ibeacon network is studied. 3 circle positioning and centroid positioning algorithms are commonly used indoor positioning algorithms. However, due to the wireless signal in the process of indoor transmission will have a certain attenuation. Therefore, there will be some errors in these positioning algorithms. In this paper, the positioning error is reduced by filtering out the equipment information with large error, and then an improved multi circle positioning algorithm is proposed based on the three circle positioning. At the same time, the weighted centroid algorithm is added to the improved positioning algorithm, which can effectively improve the positioning accuracy. Compared with the traditional positioning algorithm, the improved positioning algorithm can limit the positioning error within 4 m. Compared with the traditional location algorithm, this algorithm is more stable. Finally, the paper gives the experimental simulation of the improved algorithm. With the help of Ibeacon equipment, the system obtains the distance between the current position and Ibeacon anchor. Through the simulation experiment, the improved algorithm of direction control is added, which performs well in the area block.},

  abstract = {With the development of information computing, online learning platforms have become increasingly popular, but there are still problems such as unsuitable learning resource recommendations. Therefore, this study proposes an online learning platform based on artificial intelligence adaptive learning and collaborative filtering algorithms, with innovation primarily reflected in the knowledge tracking model and multiple improvements to the collaborative filtering algorithm. The study also introduces knowledge acquisition/knowledge forgetting mechanisms and learning progress speed, significantly improving the accuracy of identifying learners’ knowledge state evolution. In the improvements to the collaborative filtering algorithm, the study first integrates user feature weights, then combines confidence factors with cosine similarity calculations, and finally introduces constraint factors to optimize neighborhood selection. The experiment shows that the maximum accuracy of knowledge state prediction of the improved model is 80.5%, which is 9.2 higher than the second best convolutional knowledge tracking model. The root mean square error and r

            are −0.005 and 0.005 higher than the second best deep crossover network, respectively. When the constraint factor is 2, the improved collaborative filtering algorithm achieves the minimum mean absolute error of 0.784. The improved algorithm achieves the best performance when the amount of neighboring nodes is 30, with a recommendation accuracy of 80.6%. At the same time, the teaching effect of the lab class is significantly better than that of the control class. In difficult questions, the correct answer rate is 4.9% higher than that of the control class, and there is statistical significance between the samples (

  abstract = {This study investigated the mechanical response of composite materials based on polyester resin and fiberglass, doped with large silicon carbide (SiC) particles (100–250 µm). The research included bending tests (ASTM D7264), nanoindentation, and multiscale computational homogenization to describe the mechanical behavior across scales. SiC doping was applied at 1.5%, 3%, and 5% by weight, using two fiberglass configurations: continuous laminates and a mixed arrangement of continuous and discontinuous laminates, with 13 fiberglass layers per sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyzed porosity and SiC distribution at the interface, while nanoindentation tests examined the matrix, fibers, SiC particles, and their interfaces. Long laminate stacking provided the best mechanical performance due to uniform reinforcement distribution at the fiber/matrix interface. Increasing the SiC content in long laminates improved flexural strength by 17.5% compared to undoped samples. In contrast, mixed laminates exhibited a 41% strength reduction due to SiC particle agglomeration and stress concentrations. Bending curves of SiC-doped samples showed three stiffness zones, attributed to hierarchical mechanical behavior with progressive reinforcement activation. The large SiC particle size and low fraction enhanced deformation capacity below 50 MPa while increasing flexural strength. This balance of strength and deformation represents a novel finding in composite performance.},

  abstract = {Background
            Lactoferrin (LTF), a conserved glycoprotein, plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis, oxidative stress management, and anti-inflammatory responses. Its high iron-binding affinity and protective actions make it a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, characterized by oxidative damage and disrupted metal homeostasis.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed to modulate LTFs activity, providing a cost-effective therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.
          
          
            Methods
            We employed molecular docking to screen a library of ∼3500 FDA-approved drugs for binding affinity to LTF. Drug profiling and PASS analysis were used to predict biological activities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations evaluated the stability of LTF-drug complexes, with key parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, and hydrogen bonding assessed. Principal component analysis and free energy landscape mapping further explored protein-ligand interactions and conformational stability.
          
          
            Results
            Ten drugs with high binding affinities were identified, among which Mosapramine and Quinupramine emerged as promising candidates based on their drug profiling and PASS activities. These drugs demonstrated stable binding to LTFs iron-binding pocket, as confirmed by MD simulations. Drug profiling indicated neuroprotective properties, including anti-inflammatory and cognitive-enhancing activities. PCA and free energy analyses revealed conformational stability of the LTF-drug complexes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            This study highlights Mosapramine and Quinupramine as potential modulators of LTF for neurodegenerative diseases. The findings underscore the efficacy of computational screening in repurposing drugs, paving the way for further experimental validation and therapeutic development.},

  abstract = {The integration of wind power into extensive grid networks presents a confluence of challenges arising from the inherently intermittent nature of wind resources and transmission bottlenecks. To address these complexities and maximize wind energy utilization while meeting demand requirements, a holistic planning paradigm is indispensable. Such an approach entails the synergistic coordination of wind power capacity allocation and siting, expansion of transmission infrastructure, and integration of energy storage systems. Additionally, operational strategies for both generation assets and energy storage facilities play pivotal roles in optimizing system performance. A joint planning framework is formulated to minimize the aggregate costs associated with transmission network augmentation, energy storage system deployment and operation, conventional unit dispatch, wind curtailment, and penalties incurred during periods of high demand. This model incorporates linearized representations of constraints governing energy storage system planning and operation and quadratic generation cost functions, facilitated by Mixed-Integer Linear Programming methodologies. Rigorous evaluation of the proposed methodology is conducted utilizing representative test systems across diverse scenario settings. The empirical findings underscore the efficacy of the devised planning model in significantly bolstering load acceptance capacity and facilitating heightened levels of wind power integration within the grid infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of electricity load time series is crucial for optimizing power system scheduling and ensuring reliable operation. However, existing approaches face challenges in effectively capturing long-term global trends while addressing short-term local fluctuations. This study proposes a hybrid strategy that integrates the Mamba algorithm for long-term predictions with the Transformer model for short-term forecasting, leveraging the complementary strengths of both methods. The Mamba algorithm captures global trends in long-term sequences, while the Transformer focuses on local variations in short-term data. This combination enhances both long-term trend accuracy and the detection of short-term fluctuations. Additionally, a robust sequence decomposition module is introduced to refine the sliding window mechanism, which segments long sequences for Transformer input, thereby reducing computational overhead and memory demands. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms both standalone Mamba and Transformer models in prediction precision, computational efficiency, and memory optimization. Specifically, compared to Mamba, the hybrid model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 37%, and compared to Transformer, it achieves an 11% reduction in MSE. Additionally, the training time is shortened by 34%, and GPU memory usage is reduced by 47%. These findings confirm that the proposed strategy effectively integrates the advantages of Mamba and Transformer, achieving reliable long-term load forecasting alongside robust short-term prediction capabilities.

  abstract = {A crucial aspect of creating character images in digital media is ensuring that animated characters’ details and distinctive features are accurately aligned. Additionally, facial animation contour feature matching and seamless splicing are essential for conveying precise facial expressions, making them key technologies in the creation of animated characters. Traditional facial motion capture technology makes it difficult for the audience to experience the character’s expressions. Low matching accuracy, low stitching efficiency, and severe image distortion after stitching are just a few of the issues that need to be addressed. An animation-based face contour feature matching method is proposed in this paper to address the issues raised above. Training a neural network with images of faces and animation characters is the first step in matching the datasets. Then, a Gaussian low-pass filter is used to scale and denoise the complex animation image in the scene. By using the double threshold method, a smooth image’s contour is detected, and the contour feature is extracted and a matching relationship is built. Finally, the facial key point bone parameters are used in conjunction with the face geometry correction. The best matching pair of faces is selected for image contour stitching based on a qualitative analysis of character expressions. The results of the simulation show that it has better feature matching accuracy, shorter running time, and stronger anti-distortion ability than the traditional stitching method, which greatly helps to improve the efficiency of animation manufacturing and increase the output.},

The evaluation of the inhibitors’ effectiveness for protecting mild steel was conducted using the weight loss method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the Tafel method. The surface characteristics of the metal coupons were characterised using surface characterisation techniques (scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy). The hydrophobic properties of the inhibitors were evaluated by means of contact angle. Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Frumkin's isothermal models were used to study inhibitor adsorption properties. The best fit was obtained for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adsorption process is a mixed type rather than physisorption or chemisorption. The inhibitor PPMTU exhibits the maximum inhibition efficiency of 99% by the weight loss method and 98% by the Tafel method at a concentration of just 90 µM. Notably, this is the first work to attain this high inhibition efficiency at a remarkably very low concentration of inhibitor, indicating that a very small amount is sufficient to control the corrosion process by up to 99%. The experimental data are validated using computational methods. The results are promising.},

  abstract = {In the communication systems of intelligent micro-grids, the intrinsic security of the physical layer is insufficient, with high computational complexity and poor robustness. To address these issues, a beamforming algorithm based on deep learning and successive convex approximation (DL-SCA) is proposed. Initially, under the premise that the norm of channel estimation error is bounded, a secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated. A deep neural network is employed to learn the intricate mapping between channel state information (CSI) and the optimal beamforming matrix, facilitating the extraction of profound channel features. Subsequently, building upon the initial solution obtained, the beamforming precoding optimization problem is further solved using the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Ultimately, through the Monte Carlo experiment based on imperfect CSI, the security performance and convergence speed of different algorithms are compared. In comparison with the zero forcing (ZF) beamforming algorithm, there is an approximate 20% increase in the system secrecy rate; and when compared with the traditional SCA algorithm, there is a reduction of about 10% in the execution time. This substantiates that the DL-SCA algorithm can effectively enhance the intrinsic security performance of the micro-grid, with high robustness and rapid convergence.},

Because of taking state variables from the model, the system’s resilience against disturbances is notably strengthened. In contrast to the augmentation error signal design method, this approach allows for the derivation of the adaptive control law without the need for an augmentation error signal. Consequently, there is a reduction in the number of adjustable parameters, and the elimination of a set of filters significantly simplifies the system structure, rendering it more amenable to engineering implementation.

  abstract = {In the face of increasingly complex and multi-phase construction projects, traditional scheduling methods struggle to account for uncertainties commonly encountered on construction sites—such as sudden weather changes, delayed material deliveries, and fluctuating labor availability. These unpredictable factors often lead to significant discrepancies between actual progress and the original schedule. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid construction progress optimization scheduling model that combines the A* algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA), referred to as the A*-GA model. This approach leverages the heuristic search capability of the A* algorithm and the global optimization power of GA. The A*-GA model first employs the A* algorithm to generate an initial construction schedule, prioritizing candidate solutions to identify the most efficient task execution path and ensure rational allocation of time and resources. This preliminary plan is then further refined using GA. Through customized encoding schemes, fitness functions, and genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation, the model iteratively evolves better scheduling solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the A*-GA model significantly improves project efficiency, reducing the overall construction period by 59 days and cutting costs by 1.501 million yuan. The proposed model proves effective in optimizing both time and cost, offering a more intelligent and adaptive solution for construction progress management in complex engineering environments.},

In this study, we focus on tackling the challenges posed by the OpenMIC-2018 (Open Museum Identification Challenge-2018) dataset. Leveraging the powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the research aims to address common interference factors in instrument recognition, such as background noise, pitch variations, and volume fluctuations during performances. By effectively mitigating these challenges, this approach enhances the accuracy and precision of instrument recognition, offering valuable contributions to both academic research and practical applications. Firstly, FFT (fast Fourier transform) is used to extract MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient), chroma, time-domain, and spectral energy from each audio frame. Initial CNN models with 10 different hyperparameters are trained, and the prediction results are merged with the original features. Then, one-dimensional convolutional layers are used for spectral feature convolution operations, and pooling layers are used for downsampling. ReLU (rectified linear unit) is used as the activation function and nonlinearity is applied. Dropout layers are added between convolutional layers and a portion of neurons are randomly set to zero. Next, the learning rate is adjusted based on cross-validation. For multi-label classification tasks, a binary cross-entropy loss is used and parameters are updated through backpropagation algorithm. Finally, a secondary CNN model is used. The merged features are input and the prediction results are obtained. The research results indicate that the innovative method used achieves an average accuracy of 0.92 on OpenMIC-2018, with an accuracy of 0.97 for accordion, flute, and organ, realizing relatively precise instrument recognition.},

  abstract = {The social sciences and humanities have increasingly adopted computational terminology as the organizing categories for inquiry. We argue that by organizing research around vernacular computational objects (e.g. data, algorithms, or AI) and divided worldly domains (e.g. finance, health, and governance), scholars risk obscuring the universalizing practices and ambitions of computation. These practices seek to establish new relationalities at unprecedented scales, connecting disparate domains, circulating resources across boundaries, and positioning computational interventions as universally applicable. Drawing on intellectual traditions that inspect the fixity of universalizing claims, we problematize the easy adoption of computational categories and argue that they serve as epistemic traps that naturalize the expanding reach of computational universalism. Instead of accepting the hardened categories of our interlocutors, we propose attending to the partial, effortful, and often contested work of translation and commensuration that enables computational actors to position themselves as obligatory passage points across all domains. This approach reveals not only the remarkable achievements of computational relationalities at scale but also their exclusions, betrayals, and partialities. Our intervention aims to spur perspectives that examine how computational actors parse both technical objects and social worlds to advance universalizing ambitions while simultaneously obscuring the enormous labor required to maintain these divisions and connections.},

  abstract = {The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework offers a robust and intuitively probabilistic approach, presenting advantages over the less interpretable neural network models, particularly in the context of image super-resolution. Traditional applications of GPR in super-resolution have primarily focused on the posterior mean for generating predictions, neglecting the insightful predictive variance. This variance quantifies the confidence level of each prediction, a critical aspect for ensuring the reliability of the reconstructed images. In this study, we leverage this underutilized metric by incorporating a confidence regularization term into the iterative back projection process. This innovation aims to enhance the reconstruction fidelity by guiding the enhancement process in a more informed manner. Our extensive experimental analysis on established benchmark datasets confirms the superior performance and efficiency of our proposed approach, marking a significant advancement in super-resolution methodologies.},

The results show a significant negative correlation between economic policy uncertainty and corporate performance. However, financial slack can reduce the negative impact of this uncertainty on corporate performance. By effectively managing financial slack, companies can mitigate the adverse effects of economic policy uncertainty.

However, due to the relatively recent development of online education, the quality of available resources varies significantly. To address this issue, this study explores the application of machine learning in online education, focusing specifically on how to design and optimize personalized learning paths. The goal is to enhance learning effectiveness by tailoring educational resources to individual needs. In this approach, student learning data is collected and analyzed using the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize students into distinct learning groups. Based on each group’s learning objectives and focus areas, customized resources are recommended to provide a more targeted and optimized learning experience. Through user collaborative filtering, users were asked to rate the recommended courses and improve resource recommendation. Then, based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, the content features of learning resources were analyzed and targeted learning path recommendations were made. Finally, through deep Q-learning network (DQN), personalized learning path planning was further strengthened and improved, achieving functions such as personalized learning path recommendation, intelligent tutoring system, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and optimized resource allocation. By combining machine learning methods to optimize the learning path of online education, the learning efficiency of students was significantly improved; their learning experience was optimized; the coherence of learning was greatly improved. The satisfaction of students with the online education platform improved by using machine learning under high-frequency usage ranged from 4.6 to 4.9, which was considered very satisfactory. After learning, the learning performance score was as high as 4.7 to 4.9, which was considered excellent.

However, integrating Spherical Video-Based Virtual Reality (SVVR) with IBL remains underexplored. This study proposed an SVVR-based IBL approach to enhance geography education for high school students in Thailand. A quasi-experimental design was used, with students divided into an experimental group (SVVR-based IBL) and a control group (IBL only). Results showed significant learning improvements in both groups, with the experimental group achieving notably higher gains.

Monte Carlo simulation is then employed to generate a large dataset of input samples, from which the first-order and total sensitivity indices for each variable are calculated to assess their impact on the model’s output. The NSGA-II algorithm, a multi-objective optimization technique, is utilized to balance multiple objectives within the cost model. By optimizing parameter settings, the study evaluates the model’s predictive performance under various parameter combinations, including the associated time and resource consumption.

It used 11 financial indicators as the main data to collect financial data from multiple enterprises and form a dataset. GA can be used to optimize the weights of financial indicators. This article constructed a FHA model, evaluated the constructed model, conducted corresponding analysis based on experimental results, and drew conclusions. The results showed that the model optimized by GA had significant improvements in evaluation accuracy and adaptability. The maximum mean squared error (MSE) of the GA in all comparative experiments was 19.962, which was lower than the minimum MSE of 20.043 obtained by other comparative methods. The maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the GA in all comparisons was 4.988, which was lower than the minimum MAE of 5.031 obtained by other comparison methods. This indicates that the enterprise financial health evaluation model based on GA has sufficient accuracy, is more objective in determining the weights of financial indicators, and has higher scientific validity in the evaluation results. The optimized enterprise FHA model provides more effective services for enterprise financial management.

  abstract = {Real-time fault monitoring in cable networks with complex topologies is of great significance in improving the stability of power systems. In recent years, Time-Reversal Multiple Signal Classification (TR-MUSIC) has been proposed for soft fault location in cable networks. This method can use single-frequency data to calculate the pseudo-spectrum and the faults can be located by finding the maximum energy positions. However, due to the propagation of harmonic signals, there will be multiple peaks in the pseudo-spectrum in the high-frequency band, which are referred to as ghosting traces. This leads to an inability to accurately determine the location of the soft fault, causing the false peak to be referred to as a ghost fault. This paper analyses the frequency characteristics of the TR-MUSIC method and then introduces the idea of co-prime sampling for frequency sampling to eliminate the influence of ghost fault. The results show that co-prime sampling in TR-MUSIC can counteract the effects of ghosting traces and reduce the computational complexity.},

Visual analysis of learning trajectories shows that some learners exhibit intermittent learning states with significant fluctuations in learning performance, while others tend to stabilize after a significant increase in performance at specific stages, indicating that their learning strategies are effective in the early stages but then enter a learning bottleneck period. Some learners exhibit a decline in performance, suggesting that their current learning strategies are ineffective.

  abstract = {Functional core stability training has been widely applied in various fields and has shown positive results. In order to study its application methods and effects in police physical training, we developed a mathematical model according to the characteristics of fighting of SWAT, and methods are designed to be more in line with the action form of the fighting of SWAT. Except for the traditional strength exercise, this research adds another 12 weeks of core stability exercise, and then conducted a study on seven indicators that reflect the strength of fighting with hands before and after this 12 weeks of exercise, using these mathematical data to construct a mode. The mathematical model features of the core stability training for special police combat are shown as follows: the effect of exercise in the experimental group is significantly better than the control group. However, the core stability exercise has a different degree of impact on those indicators that reflect the strength of fighting with hands.},

This study integrates machine learning algorithms and data-driven methods to deeply mine massive learning data and construct an efficient adaptive teaching model. The model uses advanced machine learning techniques to identify each learner’s needs and learning paths accurately. Research data shows that the practical application of this model has increased the learning efficiency of business English learners by 30% and significantly improved their learning satisfaction. In terms of a data-driven approach, over 5 million pieces of learning data were collected and analyzed, covering learners’ learning habits, performance changes, feedback, and other aspects. These data provide a strong basis for optimizing teaching strategies, making teaching more accurate and personalized. This study utilizes machine learning algorithms to achieve immediate responses and personalized guidance for learners’ questions.

In today’s interactive media landscape, the significance of storyboard design for animation is becoming increasingly prominent. This paper aims to propose an intelligent storyboard algorithm to enhance the design of interactive contexts in animation and advance the modernization of animation production. A basic framework for storyboard-based virtual assembly animation is established, integrating storyboard scripting with virtual assembly technology commonly used in film and television. The entire assembly process is realized through the continuous construction of scenes, providing a detailed approach to the information representation and modeling of the storyboard script. Experimental results demonstrate that the storyboard virtual assembly animation system proposed in this paper significantly improves the interactive effects of animation and enhances the intelligent processing capabilities of animation production. Consequently, this system can be employed in future intelligent storyboard animations to optimize the expression of interactive contexts.},

  abstract = {In the realm of contemporary education, the emergence of big data technology has underscored the significance of analyzing student emotional and cognitive patterns, a process crucial for unveiling individual traits and needs throughout the learning experience. This study introduces a novel diagnostic framework, leveraging big data to precisely evaluate these patterns and enhance the allocation of personalized teaching resources. Traditional analysis methodologies, often limited by their inability to effectively process complex data structures and provide operational utility, are thus addressed. The proposed framework incorporates an integrative approach for emotional and cognitive diagnosis, employing Bayesian networks’ probabilistic distribution methods. This approach not only augments the interpretability of diagnostic outcomes but also streamlines the estimation of student ability distributions. Additionally, a groundbreaking multi-objective optimization strategy, grounded in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), is presented, complemented by a solution method devised using a hybrid adaptive ant colony algorithm. This innovative method facilitates the efficient allocation of personalized learning resources, thereby significantly enhancing the adaptability of teaching content to individual student needs. The findings from this methodological and empirical investigation contribute a pioneering perspective to the field of personalized teaching. They provide educational practitioners with effective decision-support tools and offer researchers novel insights and methodologies in related domains.},

            K
            NN queries, the knowledge base gets sufficient information. In the knowledge base, every tuple is thought as a region. The regions of the knowledge base will be clustered into more significant regions. When a query is submitted, our method tries to obtain all of the results from the clustered regions. From this strategy, we can minimize the response time by getting candidates set quickly from the clustered regions and avoiding partially or wholly access to the underlying systems say database or files. Numerous experiments have been conducted using datasets of varying dimensions, including low-dimensional datasets (2, 3, and 4) and high-dimensional datasets (25, 50, and 104). The outcomes of these experiments demonstrate a notable superiority of our proposed method over analogous approaches presented in antecedent literature, particularly concerning the evaluation of a sequence of

  abstract = {Auto-PLD is the automatic design algorithm framework of machine learning pipeline for the whole-process data analysis scenario. First, define a machine learning pipeline with five stages and can support the processing of continuous and discrete type features separately. Then, the automated pipeline design problem is decomposed into two sub problems: structure search and hyper parameter optimization, and an algorithm combining reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization is proposed to alternately optimize the two subproblems. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of automatic pipeline design, two parallelized pipeline construction methods are further proposed. Experimental results show that Auto-PLD outperforms auto-sklearn with most datasets. Moreover, with the increase of computing nodes, the parallelized Auto-PLD can further improve the pipeline building performance. The Auto-PLD-random method performed at 1, 4, and 8 hours respectively: 19, 22, 23, 27, 26, and 25. Automated Pipeline Design with Q-learning (Auto-PLD-Q) methods performed at 1, 4, and 8 hours: 18, 20, 26; 23, 27, and 27.

Auto-LLE is an automated machine learning algorithm framework for lifelong learning scenarios. For the classification task based on concept drift and data imbalance, an algorithm based on weighted ensemble learning of adaptive model was proposed. Concept types are divided into “long-term concepts” and “short-term concepts,” and different types of concepts are handled separately using incremental learners and adaptive weight update methods, and automatically capture the concept drift and improve the model prediction performance. Based on Auto-PLD and Auto-LLE, we design and implement a system that supports both automated pipeline design and automated lifelong learning. In system design, high system accessibility and scalability are obtained by designing easy high-level programming interface and pluggable module integration. In task type, the common data analysis tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering are supported.},

  abstract = {This article proposes ‘Thinking with the Archipelago’ as a critical analytical lens to examine racialized urban ecologies and spatial politics in Cartagena, Colombia. Grounded in long-term ethnographic research along the Ciénaga de la Virgen, Cartagena’s largest urban wetland, this study explores how local communities negotiate socio-ecological marginalization amid colonial continuities, green gentrification, and speculative urbanism. Drawing on Caribbean thought, Black geographies, and urban political ecology, I conceptualize the “Archipelago City” as a relational, dynamic space shaped by water, mangroves, and dispossession. This spatial metaphor challenges binary logics of center and periphery, instead foregrounding fragmented but interconnected urban geographies.
          Using the historic eviction of the neighborhood Chambacú as a symbolic and discursive anchor, I trace how racialized displacement and environmental degradation continue to shape urban imaginaries and technocratic development projects. In dialogue with local resistance practices, especially community-led environmental organizing in Comuna 6, I show how everyday experiences of the mangrove become forms of counter-cartography, asserting alternative ecological futures and modes of belonging. Rather than treating nature as a neutral backdrop for development, ‘Thinking with the Archipelago’ centers the poetics and politics of relational space, reclaiming the value of wetland lifeworlds. This approach decenters technocratic narratives and illuminates how communities articulate knowledge and solidarity across fragmented geographies. Ultimately, this article calls for a critical rethinking of urban-environmental futures in the Caribbean, emphasizing how colonial and neoliberal orders are actively contested through situated, everyday practices of resistance and care.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the teaching quality level of university courses is a very meaningful teaching research work. In the context of big data, various artificial intelligence algorithms can effectively utilize massive data to construct intelligent models for evaluating the teaching quality of universities. Popular algorithms include genetic algorithm, BP (Back Propagation) neural network, and support vector machine. However, the modeling steps of these algorithms are usually cumbersome and time-consuming. In response to this, this article proposed a university teaching quality evaluation model based on the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The model calculated the posterior probability of labels using Bayesian formula and the posterior probability of features by statistically analyzing the feature distribution in the sample. The label with the highest posterior probability was selected as the evaluation result for the feature vector. This article designed experiments to verify the performance advantages and disadvantages of this model compared to other models, and compared the modeling time, accuracy, mean square error, and disciplinary generality of the Naive Bayes model with the three aforementioned models. The results indicated that the modeling time of the Naive Bayes model was 0.12 seconds, with an accuracy of 0.895 and a mean square error of 0.1902. The accuracy difference between science and philosophy disciplines was 0.029, with a mean square error difference of 0.0190. Although the model in this article does not have an advantage in prediction accuracy compared to other models, it has good disciplinary universality, mainly due to its simple model structure and extremely short modeling time.},

The research aimed to investigate the extent to which holistic Chinese cultural thinking is applied to drive sustainable business practices in China. We drew empirical insights from multiple perspectives and 74 key informant interviews, ranging from Chinese government officials and practitioners to university academics. Using Foucault’s episteme to examine the possibility of a transition to systems thinking, our key findings reveal that the Chinese micro-economy and firm-level operations, whilst being aware of the importance of environmental issues from top–down, still focus on economic values in the short run. However, as an episteme change is recognized over time, it is likely that the gap between vision and practice will be narrowed down, and a sustainable China just might prevail.},

The proposal of “Inflection Point Analysis Method” and “CrossMountain” pattern solves the problems of scattered clustering and low discrimination caused by the minimum perplexity determining the number of topics; the model can automatically construct subtopic evolution scenarios based on time windows, effectively alleviating the phenomenon of topic drift. The experiments were conducted from the optimal number of topics and topic perplexity, dynamic subtopic detection, and subtopic evolution relationship scenarios, verifying that the Dynamic Subtopic Detection Model for Temporal Text outperforms the topic perplexity method in selecting the optimal number of topics and exhibits more accurate tracking performance in dynamic subtopic detection.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a technique for constructing a typical disaster knowledge graph integrated with its spatial and temporal characteristics. First of all, through the analysis of typical disaster events, established the “event-space-time-causal” triplet model, the disaster three factors relationship, formed a comprehensive, systematic disaster knowledge framework, and then use deep learning technology of semantic analysis of large amounts of text data and relationship extraction, to automatically build a disaster knowledge map.

The results show that the knowledge graph construction method can better express the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of some natural disasters, and provide more comprehensive and accurate disaster prevention and control and response strategies for decision-making agencies.

The use of ink, brushstrokes, and thematic components influenced by Confucianism, Daoism, and other philosophical traditions are few of the creative styles and methods that were popular during this period in Han painting (HP). HP is distinguished by its delicate brushstrokes, subtle ink washes, and meticulous attention to detail. It frequently depicts themes of nature, landscapes, animals, and everyday life. As an integral part of China’s creative legacy, this form of art continues to be honored and it had a significant effect on later Chinese painting (CP) shape. HPs’ color qualities and Patterns would suffer significant deterioration with time. Research on the culture indicates that Han art is limited. In addition, there is a powerful correlation between changes in the reliability of CP and the environment. The conservation and study of traditional Chinese HP techniques by artificial intelligence (AI) offers a possible path forward for the preservation and knowledge of this historic art form. In this research, the link between safeguarding the environment and the patterns (P), color (C), and shapes (S) of CP was investigated using a novel earthworm tuned recurrent neural network (EW- TRNN). We gathered Hans CP datasets as experimental data. Image preprocessing using Gaussian blur filter for noise reduction. Feature extraction employs the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to capture the textural P and brushwork style characteristics. The study’s findings demonstrate that the suggested approach is more authentic in predicting the P, S, and C features of Chinese artworks.

This article used gated recurrent unit (GRU) to conduct in-depth analysis and learning of athlete training data, and designed targeted training plans for athletes to achieve the goal of improving sports performance. Firstly, a set of athlete training data was collected, and wavelet transform and box plot methods were utilized to denoise and handle outliers in the data; then, the GRU model was used to analyze these data and extract the most valuable feature indicators, providing a basis for adjusting subsequent training schemes. Finally, taking 15 basketball players from A University as research subjects, a personalized training plan was designed to help them better train and improve training effectiveness. The experiment showed that 15 athletes were selected, and their average score on the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) test after the experiment was 14.73 points, which was 2.4 points higher than before the experiment. Before the experiment, only 4 people had an FMS score of 14 or above, accounting for 26.67%, which was very low. However, after the experiment, 12 people had an FMS score of 14 or above, accounting for as high as 80%. Based on the GRU model, personalized training plans were studied to improve athlete performance and health, providing new research ideas for athletes to develop personalized training plans. This can better adapt to the different needs of different types of athletes, thereby improving their training effectiveness and competitive level.},

  abstract = {With the development and popularity of automated parking lots, the problem of high energy consumption generated by unreasonable scheduling of parking robots has become increasingly prominent. In order to solve the scheduling problem of automatic parking lot, an intelligent scheduling strategy based on deep Q-network algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of high energy consumption caused by unreasonable scheduling in automatic parking lot. By introducing double deep Q-network architecture and advantage function, the scheduling strategy of the robot is optimized. In this study, the time difference error is used as the weight of the sample cache and the negative energy consumption value is used as the reward function to evaluate the performance of the improved deep Q-network algorithm and the traditional algorithm. The simulation results show that the improved deep Q-network algorithm performs well in vehicle scheduling optimization with a reward value of 46.8. By analyzing the distribution of vehicles in the garage under different algorithms, the effectiveness of the improved deep Q-network algorithm in preferentially utilizing high-quality garage resources is further verified. It demonstrates how the enhanced deep Q-network algorithm can efficiently optimize the automated parking lot’s scheduling strategy while utilizing the premium garage to lower operational energy usage.},

In order to solve these problems, a hydraulic oscillator is designed. When drilling fluid flows through the hydraulic oscillator, the hydraulic oscillator generates mild oscillating forces and is transmitted through the drill tool to the drill bit, thereby reducing the friction of the drill tool on the wall, reducing the possibility of pressure and sticking. In order to verify the rationality of the design, Simulink is used to simulate the dynamic characteristics of the screw motor in the oscillator. The results show that the speed of the screw motor fluctuates from 0 to 0.01 s, and the stable speed of 6.8 r/s will be reached after 0.01 s. Finally, the prototype is trial-produced and tested.

  abstract = {Due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak in 2019, many schools are unable to teach online, which stimulates the birth of a new teaching model in the education industry. Online teaching has developed by leaps and bounds with the rapid development of information technology. Information-based teaching is a way to enhance student learning from the learning environment. There are many factors that influence the learning environment, including the classroom teaching scenario, cooperation between teachers and students, and communication in the classroom. In the teaching process, the teaching mode has changed from the traditional teacher-teaching-student-learning fill-in-the-blank teaching to the independent acquisition of knowledge by students. In order to investigate the current status of teaching informatics on the Internet, we chose a university in city A as a research object to investigate the current status of teaching informatics in its online philosophy department. At present, information technology teaching in China is still in a backward state. The current situation of information-based teaching in China is (1) the lack of information-based teaching resources and the lack of standardization in the use of resources. (2) Lack of awareness of online information teaching. In order to promote the level of online information-based learning of our schoolchildren from a comprehensive perspective, and in response to the drawbacks of online information-based teaching in China found in the above experimental survey, we propose an online information-based learning model based on big data and artificial intelligence decision-making to enhance students’ learning interest through an interesting learning model. After experimental verification, it can be concluded that our proposed model can significantly improve students’ behavioral performance and learning ability, and has a certain role in enhancing students’ learning effectiveness. Finally, we make recommendations based on the current state of application of big data and artificial intelligence in online informatics teaching. The recommendations are to improve the current situation of information-based teaching on the one hand to improve the quality of information-based resources, which requires the joint gate-keeping of the government, schools and teachers.

  abstract = {Demand-side management is becoming increasingly pivotal in modern power systems. This paper introduces a highly practical distributed control strategy for managing clusters of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). The approach is designed to enhance the participation of TCL clusters in demand-side management, ensuring efficient and reliable power system operations. The proposed control strategy defines a priority list, where TCLs can locally reconstruct the global priority list through distributed information exchange. Based on this list, TCLs make local decisions regarding their operational states. Furthermore, the strategy employs an asynchronous communication protocol, which significantly reduces the cost of establishing communication networks compared to control strategies based on synchronous communication. Numerical simulations confirm that, under the asynchronous communication mechanism, the proposed strategy effectively achieves precise tracking of the cluster’s aggregated power relative to the reference power, while also minimizing occurrences of temperature exceedance.},

To gain a deeper understanding for the impact of advertising images on audience sentiments and preference prediction, a saliency prediction model and an advertising preference prediction model for text reinforcement learning are proposed based on eye movement data. The saliency prediction model enhanced the visual features of advertising images by analyzing the text saliency in advertisements. The advertising preference prediction model utilized eye movement data and graph convolutional neural networks to understand individual visual reactions and sentiment preferences towards advertising images. The performance test results indicated that the proposed significance prediction model performed excellently on the accuracy-recall curve and F-measure curve. The accuracy on the model prediction performance of the study using the method was 0.787, SROCC was 0.628, PLCC was 0.583, and EMD decreased to 0.064. The highest SROCC value between the model and the true value can reach 0.6169, the highest PLCC can reach 0.5722, and the lowest error is 0.1929. The average similarity of the advertising preference prediction model was about 0.55 when the liking score was 1. When the score was 7, the average similarity increased to about 0.65. It presents that the method can effectively predict different preferences and meet practical application needs. As a result, the study not only enriches the research framework of advertising sentiment analysis and preference prediction but also provides more practical tools and methods for advertisement design, personalized recommendation, and marketing strategy development.

To address this issue, this study proposes an enterprise information resource sharing model based on YOLO algorithm, which combines a gated recurrent unit with an improved YOLOv4, taking shipyard enterprises as an example for research. YOLO, as a powerful real-time object detection tool, can effectively process image and visual document data.

  abstract = {Introduction:
            Early detection through routine screening methods, such as the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, is crucial for reducing cervical cancer mortality. However, the Pap smear method faces challenges including subjective interpretation, significant variability in diagnostic confidence, and high susceptibility to human errors—leading to both false negatives (missed abnormalities) and false positives (unnecessary follow-up procedures). Providing a first opinion could improve the screening examination pipeline and greatly aid the specialist’s confidence in reporting. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have shown promise in automating cell classification, reducing human error, and identifying subtle abnormalities that may be missed by experts.
          
          
            Methods:
            In this study, we present RunicNet, a CNN-based architecture with attention mechanisms designed to classify Pap smear cell images. RunicNet integrates attention mechanisms such as High-Frequency Attention Blocks-enhanced Residual Blocks for improved feature extraction, Pixel Attention for computational efficiency, and a Gated-Dconv Feed-Forward Network to refine image representation. The model was trained on a dataset of 85 080 cell images, employing data augmentation and class balancing techniques to address dataset imbalances.
          
          
            Results:
            Evaluated on a separate testing dataset, RunicNet achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.78, significantly outperforming baseline models such as ResNet-18 (F1-score of 0.53) and a fully connected CNN (F1-score of 0.66).
          
          
            Discussion:
            The findings support the potential of attention-based CNN models like RunicNet to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening.

  abstract = {The nonnegative representation-based classification (NRC) method has attracted increasing attention in the field of face recognition. Building upon collaborative representation (CR), NRC incorporates a nonnegative constraint on the representation coefficients, thereby reducing the contribution of irrelevant training samples and enhancing overall classification performance. Despite these improvements, NRC inherits the same decision-making mechanism as the CR method, resulting in a decoupling of the representation and classification stages. This separation limits the method’s classification effectiveness. Furthermore, the presence of multicollinearity in the nonnegative representation may introduce inaccuracies in classification estimates, further undermining performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the competitive-collaborative nonnegative representation (CCNR) model. CCNR integrates two regularization terms: A competitive constraint and a collaborative constraint. The competitive constraint adopts a residual-based strategy during the classification stage, thereby strengthening the connection between representation and classification. This approach enables training samples from different classes to compete in representing the query sample, significantly improving classification performance.

We use parallel survey experiments in the United States and China across two waves in early 2020 and mid-2023 to assess the extent to which threat perceptions consistent with security dilemma thinking exist among mass publics, change with political context, and can be ameliorated. Our findings are consistent with interpretations of the security dilemma emphasizing its relative intractability. At least in the U.S.-China context, threat perceptions consistent with security dilemma thinking do not appear easily ameliorated by priming respondents to consider factors believed to ameliorate the security dilemma: offense-defense distinguishability, economic interdependence, nuclear weapons, and the reciprocal nature of the security dilemma.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging method that utilizes radio waves and magnetic fields. This study focuses on reducing the acoustic noise produced inside the cylindrical shell of the scanner, where the patient is located. Vibration modes are generated by eddy currents in the cylindrical shell induced by gradient magnetic fields. Additionally, the scanner wall is typically joined to the gradient spiral cylinder, causing vibrations to be transmitted to the wall and thereby producing extra sound waves. The present study investigates methods for mitigating noise from the scanner wall and reducing the transmission noise from the spiral gradient cylinder. Numerical methods and practical solutions for lowering acoustic noise in MRI gradient coils are explored. A 20 mm uniform absorber is demonstrated as an effective design for significantly reducing acoustic noise in the frequency range 0 to 3 kHz. Finally, numerical analysis of gradient cycles yields solutions that lower both vibration and noise levels.},

This study focuses on the relationship between thinking styles and role selection tendencies among Uyghur and Han students in a CSCL environment in a cross-cultural context. Using the Thinking Style Scale, the study surveyed 82 Uyghur and Han students in the second year of junior high school at No. 23 Middle School in Urumqi, Xinjiang, and revealed significant differences and correlations in their thinking styles and role selection in CSCL learning. The study also explains the mechanisms behind the differences in thinking styles and role choices from the perspective of cultural adaptation theory. The findings are as follows: (1) There are significant differences in thinking styles between Uyghur and Han students in a cross-cultural context. (2) Uyghur and Han students show different tendencies in role selection during CSCL learning. (3) There is a significant correlation between specific thinking styles and specific role selections among Uyghur and Han students in a cross-cultural context. The results not only enrich the theoretical foundation of cross-cultural education but also provide new perspectives and strategies for role allocation and instructional design in CSCL practice, contributing to the enhancement of ethnic unity, mutual assistance, and integration.},

First, the optimization of third-party logistics distribution for agricultural products and the construction of an evaluation index system are carried out. Then, the analytic network process is used to establish a comprehensive evaluation system that includes multiple levels and evaluation index. The results indicate that the analytic network process has the best performance. When the evaluation process is 100%, the complexity, adaptability to dynamic environments, decision consistency, and usability are 57.3%, 19.2%, 92.6%, and 93.1%, respectively. The example analysis results show that the second service provider can be the preferred target. The above results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, provide scientific basis for the selection of agricultural product logistics service providers, and provide direction for logistics service providers to improve and optimize their services.},

  abstract = {In recent years, student management methods have evolved from traditional disciplinary approaches to comprehensive quality education, emphasizing holistic development and personalized guidance. The application of information technology has made management more intelligent, with smart systems and big data analytics providing services more closely aligned with student needs. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies, NLP techniques have also made significant strides. This paper introduces an innovative SC-BGRU-ATT sentiment polarity analysis framework for analyzing student comment data using NLP techniques. This framework begins with the extraction of textual data using word embedding techniques, followed by further feature processing through Text-CNN and BI-GRU with a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a classification module is employed to identify the sentiment polarity of the texts. The test results on public datasets show that the framework achieves over 80% accuracy in identifying two types of sentiment polarity, and over 90% accuracy on self-built datasets. This significant performance demonstrates the potential of our framework in advancing sentiment polarity analysis. Moreover, by accurately capturing and analyzing students’ sentiment and opinions, this approach supports more effective self-organization and management of students. The innovation of this study lies in the integration of multiple models and the enhancement of relevant modules’ performance, leading to an improvement in sentiment polarity analysis. This technological advancement not only refines sentiment polarity analysis but also provides a scalable and adaptable framework for analyzing student sentiment in educational settings. The improved model performance offers robust, data-driven support for decision-making in student management, enabling institutions to better understand and respond to student needs. Furthermore, the modular design of our approach allows for seamless future enhancements, including integration with transformer-based models and multimodal data processing, ensuring continued advancements in sentiment analysis applications.},

  abstract = {Artistic portraiture holds a significant position in the art world, with its stories of artistic personalities carrying significant educational value and holding offers much scope for research. Amidst the contemporary artistic education milieu, pedagogical practices have embraced an amalgam of online and offline intelligent instruction modes, thus broadening the art students’ access to artistic portraiture. However, the abundance of digital resources has created a concomitant conundrum regarding the classification and selection of artistic portraiture, emerging as a pressing issue. Emotion recognition, a mechanism that enables natural human-computer interaction, assumes critical importance in artistic portraiture classification, as character emotional expressions serve as a pivotal basis for the said classification. Nevertheless, the extensive costs incurred during the collection and annotation of emotional data related to artistic portraiture constitute a major bottleneck that inhibits the development of emotion recognition research. This paper endeavors to explore the application of knowledge transfer between cross-domains or cross-tasks to enhance the efficacy of emotion recognition in scenarios involving limited or no labeling. To achieve efficient classification of portraiture, the paper employs a blend of domain adaptive and transfer learning techniques to map features onto a shared space between domains. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through unsupervised sentiment classification and labeling of artistic portraiture based on the collected dataset, which resulted in an improvement in performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 46.7% compared to the most relevant domain adaptive sentiment analysis methods.},

  abstract = {As global environmental problems become increasingly severe, the concept of green development has gradually become an important strategic direction for corporate development. As an important tool to measure the environmental performance of enterprises, green accounting is of great significance to promote the sustainable development of enterprises. Green accounting performance evaluation can not only help enterprises identify and improve their environmental management strategies, but also provide data support for the formulation of relevant policies. However, the existing performance evaluation methods mostly focus on quantitative analysis, lacking systematic and comprehensive evaluation. Therefore, this study puts forward a performance evaluation model of enterprise green accounting based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, in order to scientifically evaluate enterprise green accounting performance in a multi-factor and multi-level environment. First, through literature research and expert interviews, this study determines the key indicators that affect the performance of enterprises’ green accounting, including resource utilization efficiency, pollution emission control, and environmental protection investment return. These weights derived from AHP are then integrated into the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, where they are applied to weight the membership degrees of each performance indicator. This integration allows the model to combine the structural rigor of AHP with the flexibility of fuzzy logic, resulting in a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of green accounting performance. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to generate a weighted composite score that reflects the overall environmental performance of enterprises across multiple green accounting indicators. Through the case analysis of three typical enterprises, the evaluation model based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can accurately reflect the actual performance of enterprises in green accounting. It demonstrates high applicability and operability, particularly for medium to large-sized enterprises in resource-intensive sectors such as chemical manufacturing, energy, and metallurgy, where environmental management and green investment decisions are of strategic importance. The data analysis shows that the comprehensive score of green accounting performance of enterprises evaluated by this model has increased by about 12% to 18% compared with traditional evaluation methods that rely primarily on financial metrics or single-dimensional environmental indicators. The data analysis shows that the comprehensive score of green accounting performance of enterprises evaluated by this model has increased by about 12% to 18% compared with the traditional evaluation method. The model produces a composite score for each enterprise and also classifies performance into qualitative levels such as excellent, good, moderate, passed, and failed, based on defined thresholds. This dual output enables both precise quantification and intuitive interpretation of enterprise green performance, while also effectively identifying the influence of each indicator on the overall performance and providing specific directions for improvement.},

  abstract = {Sentiment classification and prediction are critical research areas in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting sentiment tendencies and opinions from text. Previous studies have predominantly relied on sentiment dictionaries, machine learning, or deep learning methods, each of which presents two main challenges. First, sentiment dictionaries and machine learning methods heavily depend on manually constructed sentiment lexicons and features, resulting in relatively low accuracy. Second, deep learning models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and are frequently regarded as “black box” systems, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. To address these issues, we propose an optimization method for text sentiment classification that combines a large language model (LLM) with a deep learning BERT model. Specifically, building on the concept of ensemble learning, we perform dual sentiment determination by fine-tuning the BERT model in conjunction with the cue-based GPT-3.5-turbo LLM. This approach utilizes the LLM to provide a robust basis for sentiment judgment. Validation is conducted using two classical datasets: one from the entertainment domain and another from the marketing domain. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy exceeding 90%, outperforming the benchmark model by at least 2 percentage points. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing multi-domain sentiment classification performance.},

  abstract = {During COVID-19, a blended approach to online and offline interactive teaching and learning will be a primary mobile teaching methodology. The effectiveness of online and offline interactive blended learning models depends heavily on the evaluation and optimization of the quality of instruction. However, current evaluation methods often lack systematicity and accuracy, and cannot fully reflect the actual performance and learning effects of students in the interactive blended learning mode. To optimize student learning in this mobile mode, it is most important to adhere to the basic design principles, utilize micro-learning resources and establish a mobile online teaching platform. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation system and a hybrid teaching quality evaluation model based on back propagation (BP) neural network were proposed in the study. The new model innovatively combined BP neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) to propose a GA-BP optimization model. Subsequently, the accuracy and dependability of teaching quality evaluation were successfully increased by the study’s establishment of a thorough hybrid mobile system. The outcomes revealed superior student performance in the hybrid teaching mode compared to traditional methods, with an increase in the number of students achieving high scores. Among the four evaluation models (GA, BSA, BP, and GA-BP), GA-BP demonstrated the closest alignment with original grades. It yielded mean error and mean relative error of 3.78 and 0.03, respectively, representing the smallest discrepancies. These findings underpinned the efficacy of the blended instructional model in enhancing student learning outcomes. Moreover, the GA-BP-based mobile evaluation model was more accurate in assessing the quality of instruction, thus providing a more effective evaluation.},

At the same time, deep learning emphasizes the understanding, utilization and generation of knowledge, and further strengthens students’ innovation and entrepreneurship literacy by cultivating human-machine collaboration, which is in line with the concept of “learning by doing” in contextual cognitive theory. In addition, deep learning has the characteristics of thinking training, knowledge transfer and application, which echoes the requirements of higher-order thinking cultivation in Bloom’s educational goal classification theory, which can effectively improve the knowledge integration, transformation and application ability of college students, and enhance the ability of knowledge creation and innovation and entrepreneurship. In the application of practical education scenarios, taking the YOLOv5s network as an example, after the introduction of the SE module and the SIoU loss function, the average accuracy (mAP) of the feature detection and entrepreneurship scene recognition tasks of innovative projects is increased to 89.74% and 89.33%, respectively. This significant performance improvement intuitively demonstrates the ability of deep learning algorithms to accurately analyze education data.

India promotes dialogue as opposed to confrontation and has from the highest level stated ‘this is not the time for war’. Peace as rhetoric and practice constitutes a feminist principle. In the light of this positioning, what would a feminist foreign policy (FFP) look like and how should it be measured? In this article, we trace recent debates on an FFP and examine how it can conceptually apply to Indian foreign policy. Policymakers who seek positive change advocate an FFP, in keeping with UN Security Council Resolutions (SCR) 1325 and others that call for the participation of women in institutions of peace, politics and security. With a focus on the case of India, we broaden the paradigm of the FFP to include internationally accepted norms like sustainable development goals and human security be part of the goals of FFP. Further, we seek to broaden the metrics of how FFP can challenge patriarchal systems and intersecting oppressions.

  abstract = {The study primarily focuses on the optimization of query scheduling within economic dynamic systems, which are characterized by vast, sensitive datasets that necessitate exceptional accuracy and reliability. As the digital age accelerates data proliferation, the complexity of data retrieval escalates, leading to critical challenges such as sluggish query speeds and inconsistent results in existing systems. Traditional query algorithms, which rely on basic search logic such as keyword matching and hyperlink analysis, have been proven unsuitable for enterprise-scale operations, often resulting in delays and inaccurate data. To address these deficiencies, an Improved Query Scheduling (IQS) algorithm is embedded within an economic dynamic system model. The IQS leverages continuous data reading capabilities to enable seamless algorithm execution, coupled with weighted screening of query node loads. This approach significantly reduces central processing unit strain while enhancing query efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model, which processed multiple combinations of query features with a CPU execution time of less than 5 seconds and achieved near-perfect query accuracy (0.99). In real-world deployments, the model maintained stable load distribution, completing platform-level queries in 16.56 seconds at a spatial frequency of 1. These findings underscore the model’s superior query scheduling capabilities for economic dynamic systems, confirming its ability to efficiently handle routine economic data queries with precision and reliability. This advancement offers a robust solution to the persistent challenges of data-intensive economic environments.},

Alkali-treated natural fibers were utilized to fabricate composites with optimum microwave power and processing time of 600 W and 720 ± 30 s, respectively. Mechanical tests showed notable improvements compared to pure HDPE, comprising a 24.1% augmentation in tensile strength (24.2 ± 1.3 MPa), a 10.6% increase in Shore D hardness (59.2 ± 2.5), a 32.3% enhancement in flexural strength (18.3 ± 0.9 MPa), and a 28.5% rise in impact strength (23.6 ± 1.4 kJ/m²). Wear experiments indicated that wear and specific wear rate (S

            increases at lower loads (10–20 N) at moderate velocities. Friction studies showed reduced and uniform friction forces for the hybrid composite, whereas HDPE experienced 50% higher friction forces accompanied by thermal softening and adhesive wear. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated a wear progression from mild adhesive at 1 m/s to severe abrasive and thermal wear at 3 m/s. The HDPE matrix underwent substantial degradation, whereas natural fibers enhanced load-bearing capability, enhancing composite stability and tribological performance.

  abstract = {As micro-teaching software advances, more and more teachers and students opt to use micro-classroom videos for learning. Traditional video analysis methods often perform poorly and have low accuracy when analyzing micro-classroom videos. To address this issue, the research introduces a novel approach for constructing an intelligent video analysis platform. This approach integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network with the You Only Look Once version 5 small (YOLOv5s) algorithm. The bidirectional feature pyramid network classifies and integrates video image information. The research then utilizes the YOLOv5s algorithm to collect feature information from intelligent video images within micro-classrooms. The image feature information goes through an input-output process. Next, the research incorporates a fusion compression excitation attention module to improve the accuracy of model-based video analysis, ultimately building an intelligent video analysis platform for micro-classrooms. The results show that the proposed method achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.31% for various video image information, with a harmonic mean of 97.67%. Its average accuracy for video analysis reaches 0.91, significantly exceeding that of other algorithm models. In the practical effect analysis experiment of the video analysis platform, the micro-teaching software shows a memory occupancy rate of only 1.54% and a central processor occupancy rate of just 1.77%. Additionally, its response time is better than that of other video analysis platforms. These findings indicate that the proposed method provides high accuracy and strong practicality for intelligent video analysis in micro-classrooms.},

  abstract = {Addressing the issues of low prediction accuracy and slow computation speed in existing cost prediction methods for the Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) turnkey contracting model, this study proposes an improved generalized regression neural network prediction model based on a multi-universe optimization algorithm. The model employs an adaptive mechanism to regulate the exploration and exploitation phases of the algorithm, uses the optimization algorithm to determine the optimal smoothing factor, constructs the cost prediction model, and applies the entropy weight method to determine the weighting ratios of the indicators.

A prediction error of the main structure of the model is 3.9%, which is 4.6% and 1.7% lower than other algorithms, and the prediction error of the foundation engineering is +2.8%. The total cost predicted by the model exceeds the actual construction cost by 4.8688 million yuan, with a prediction error of 3.07%. This is less than the allowable deviation of ±5% for construction cost predictions. Therefore, the total cost proposed by the study exceeds the cost prediction model, which can effectively improve the accuracy of cost predictions while significantly increasing the speed of model calculations, thereby optimizing decision-making and cost management efficiency for engineering projects.},

  abstract = {With the booming development of sports events, the demand for athlete performance evaluation has begun to increase. The visualization analysis of basketball player data is significant for the analysis of individual value and potential of athletes. However, existing data analysis methods have problems such as insufficient efficiency, low accuracy, and insufficient attention to the inherent attributes of sports events. Therefore, to better analyze the composition data of basketball team members, the study combines Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Random under-sampling techniques to handle the imbalance in the athlete dataset, and then uses Random Forest (RF) to extract data features. Based on this data processing, a ensemble learning method based on SMOTE, Random under-sampling, and RF (SRR)-Voting is proposed to predict athlete performance. The results demonstrated that in the player dataset analysis, the Precision, Recall, and F1 of the research method were 0.9486, 0.9588, and 0.9752, which were superior to comparative methods. The proposed method had a ROC value of 0.94 and a fitting value of 0.17, indicating better fitting performance. This indicates that the designed player composition data visualization analysis method based on ensemble learning can effectively analyze the various attribute data of competitive players and ordinary players, providing effective data support for the comprehensive quality analysis of competitive players.},

Traditional manual approaches to inorganic materials database construction are labor-intensive and error-prone. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that leverages instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge extraction and discovery in inorganic materials science. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific corpora—including peer-reviewed articles, patents, and chemical databases—the system accurately extracts structured material-property-synthesis relationships from unstructured text. These records are aligned to a schema and stored in a queryable knowledge graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate inverse design by prompting LLMs to generate candidate materials satisfying user-defined targets (e.g., high thermal conductivity). Evaluations on benchmark synthesis corpora show high accuracy in named entity recognition (F1-score &gt; 95%) and low numerical error for temperature/duration extraction. The resulting database supports effective downstream applications such as Curie temperature prediction (RMSE = 23.6 K, R

  abstract = {Existing methods for evaluating and predicting the health status of ecosystems suffer from low efficiency and low prediction accuracy. Therefore, an urban ecosystem health evaluation system and simulation prediction method based on geographic information systems and improved Markov models is proposed. Firstly, the basic geographic data of the research area is obtained through the spatial analysis function of GIS and the interpretation technology of urban remote sensing images. Based on the pressure-state-response model framework, 15 quantitative indicators were selected from three dimensions: environmental pressure, ecological status quo, and human coping to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system. In the stage of health status assessment, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to intelligently optimize the penalty factor and kernel function parameters of the support vector machine. By adaptively adjusting the position and velocity of the particles to find the optimal parameter combination, an ecosystem health classification model with the best classification performance is finally established. The prediction module integrates the dual advantages of Markov chains and cellular automata, uses the historical state transition probability matrix to represent the evolution law of the time dimension, combines the neighborhood transformation rule of CA to describe the spatial diffusion effect, and generates future multi-scenario prediction results through explicit iterative calculations in space. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method reached 95.2%, with a root mean square error of only 0.08. After applying the proposed method to practical ecosystem health management, the probability of the health status of the corresponding regional ecosystem transitioning to a healthier state reached 0.45% and 0.30%, respectively. In addition, the health status recognition accuracy of the proposed method also reached over 98%. The urban ecological health assessment and simulation prediction method proposed in the research can effectively assist in the effective implementation of ecosystem maintenance work and provide a reliable basis for urban ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems are pivotal for enabling high-capacity wireless communications in next-generation networks. However, effective beamforming remains a key challenge due to high propagation loss and the dynamic nature of mmWave channels. Traditional approaches relying on exhaustive search or static codebooks are inefficient in mobile and blocked environments. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive beamforming algorithm that formulates beam selection as a Markov Decision Process and applies the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method to learn continuous-valued beamforming strategies. To enhance reliability, the framework integrates a hybrid policy mechanism that fuses learned actions with domain-aware heuristics for robustness under uncertainty. Simulation results show that our method achieves up to 35% higher spectral efficiency and 1.5 dB lower beam misalignment loss compared to DQN and heuristic baselines, while converging 40% faster during training. These results highlight the promise of actor–critic reinforcement learning in realizing intelligent, low-overhead beam control for dynamic mmWave MIMO environments.},

  abstract = {The growing influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital media has catalyzed the development of autonomous content creation, transforming the production and consumption of visual art, design, and cultural narratives. Despite advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), existing research often overlooks comprehensive frameworks that assess both the aesthetic quality and moral implications of AI-generated content. This research aims to bridge that gap by proposing a holistic evaluation framework tailored for GAN-generated visual media. The novelty lies in combining aesthetic feature analysis with moral assessment using deep learning and language-based evaluation tools. It utilizes the ArtBench-10 dataset, which consists of 10 diverse artistic styles. Preprocessing steps include z-score normalization, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and resizing images to 256 × 256 pixels to standardize input and enhance visual clarity. For aesthetic analysis, key features such as color harmony, texture richness, symmetry, and compositional balance were extracted using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. The proposed method employs a conditional GAN (cGAN) to autonomously generate artwork, while a GPT-based language model, along with a rule-based ethics filter, evaluates associated textual metadata to detect potential moral issues, such as bias, cultural appropriation, and offensive content. Implemented using TensorFlow 2.0, the model supports modularity and real-time evaluation. Results indicate superior classification performance, achieving 96.3% precision and a 95.2% F1-score, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework in selecting aesthetically coherent and ethically sound AI-generated visual outputs.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of financial fraud in digital finance applications—such as mobile banking, cryptocurrency transactions, and online payment gateways—has rendered traditional rule-based detection systems increasingly ineffective, leading to heightened financial losses and security vulnerabilities. These systems struggle to adapt to complex fraudulent schemes, resulting in inefficiencies in identifying such activities. This research introduces a Scalable Black Widow-driven Gradient Boosting Machine (SBW-GBM) framework designed to enhance fraud detection through real-time data analysis and machine learning (ML). The framework evaluates performance in both decentralized finance and traditional financial contexts, utilizing two separate datasets. The first dataset is based on an Ethereum Phishing Transaction Network; the second originates from Kaggle and pertains to Credit Risk Assessment. Data preparation involves addressing missing values, normalizing numerical features, and employing outlier detection techniques to improve data quality. For feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces data dimensionality while preserving critical information regarding transaction behaviors. The classification employs Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for high predictive accuracy, with the SBW algorithm dynamically fine-tuning GBM hyperparameters to enhance efficiency. Inspired by black widow spiders, the SBW algorithm optimizes hyperparameter selection by eliminating weak solutions and reinforcing stronger ones. This results in an adaptive fraud detection model trained on labeled transaction data. Experimental results confirm that SBW-GBM achieves an F1-score of 0.899, an accuracy of 0.948, an error rate of 0.128, and an experimental runtime of 0.40 seconds on Dataset 1, outperforming the baseline FFSVM. For Dataset 2, SBW-GBM attains a precision of 0.875, a recall of 0.660, an F1-score of 0.750, and an AUC of 0.932, surpassing benchmark traditional classifiers. By continuously learning from new transaction patterns, the proposed framework ensures adaptability to emerging threats and supports real-time fraud detection.},

The application of existing models in emotional computing is limited, and has difficulty matching musical characteristics with human-perceived emotions. The research proposes an Intelligent Golden Eagle-driven Scalable Reinforcement Learning (IGE-SRL) framework to optimize the emotional depth of AI-generated music compositions. Data collection involves compiling a dataset of emotionally labeled music pieces from open source. The dataset includes diverse genres and emotional contexts, ensuring balanced representation. Preprocessing includes noise reduction into fixed-length sequences. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted as key features to capture timbral and spectral characteristics relevant to emotional perception. The IGE-SRL framework uses a policy network to generate melodies and harmonies with an adaptive reward function, integrating emotion recognition models, listener feedback, and sentiment analysis. The IGE algorithm improves exploration-exploitation balance by dynamically adjusting learning parameters, while the SRL agent refines music sequences through policy gradient updates, ensuring emotionally coherent pieces. When compared to traditional methods and rule-based approaches, the suggested IGE-SRL framework greatly improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated music. The performance of the suggested IGE-SRL method was evaluated in terms of precision (95.2%), F1-score (97.3%), accuracy (95.13%), recall (96.4%), and entropy (6.124). A greater sense of musical diversity and emotional coherence is confirmed by listener evaluations. By optimizing SRL parameters, the IGE approach enhances composition quality and convergence speed.

To solve visual network problems, FFA-CausalConvoNet uses several layers and artists’ unique visual components to create works of art that mimic human efforts. The objective is to investigate the human-AI collaborative artistic production by creating a multimodal visual network that combines Chinese ink painting and Western oil painting by utilizing advanced AI techniques. A dataset containing labelled images of Chinese ink paintings and Western oil paintings was utilized for training. Gabor filters were used to capture texture and patterns, separating thin, smooth gradients of ink from rough brushstrokes of oil. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) are used for feature extraction and fusion, which improves texture and shape detection. The proposed generation method utilizes a Flexible Firefly Algorithm Driven Causality-Aware Convolutional Neural Network (FFA-CausalConvoNet) to blend these features and create hybrid artwork that performs well, successfully combining with different styles. The suggested method is implemented by using Python 3.10.1. The resulting artworks displayed a unique blend of the oil painting’s texture and the delicate brushwork of Chinese ink with style fusion accuracy (94.5%), text quality score (9.1 score), processing time (3.5 sec) and cultural fidelity (8.5 score).

Taking nylon 6 (PA6) as the research object, combined with X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, the effectiveness of the algorithm in the evolution of crystal structure (α/γ crystal transformation) was verified. The research results show that the algorithm has been tested for its ability and scalability in processing data of different spatial dimensions, with a spacing of 5 between datasets. A simulated dataset with different clustering dimensions was established to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in different clustering dimensions of the data stream. It was found that the algorithm performed well in the spatial aspect of the data stream, had good scalability, and performed well for any clustering. It can effectively handle high-dimensional data and has higher accuracy than the CluStream algorithm due to its use of subspace clustering. Nylon 6 mainly exhibits different characteristic peak shapes, such as the alpha crystalline characteristic peak shape at 2θ = 19.8° and θ = 22.9°, and the gamma crystalline characteristic peak shape corresponding to the point at θ = 20.8°. In addition, diffraction peaks of the alpha crystal form were observed, attributed to the addition of apigenin in the range of 0.01–0.05%. The effect of apigenin on the transformation of PA6 from the γ crystal form to the α crystal form decreases as its amount increases. The diffraction peak of the γ crystal structure in the figure appears again at θ = 21.2, during which 1% apigenin is added.

The model enables edge nodes to collaborate securely, ensuring accurate and trustworthy fraud diagnosis. A top-down structure is recommended for financial records, adaptively partitioned for efficiency. The differential privacy mechanism employs randomized responses, while the blockchain-secured computational model (BSCM) safeguards customer and transaction privacy. Traditional fraud detection may delay detection and response due to real-time detection restrictions. The proposed system identifies fraud in real time, saving financial losses. The blockchain paradigm provides transparent, tamper-proof transaction records and secure data storage, unlike current systems. The proposed solution employs oversampling and undersampling to handle imbalanced datasets with more fraudulent transactions than lawful ones. Theoretical analysis shows real-time fraud detection is achievable with minimal error rates while preserving privacy. Compared to client-server models, BSCM reduces data write execution time by 2.6x and improves data retrieval efficiency by 20x. Experiments also evaluate the impact of larger financial datasets. The financial record selection and information extraction models achieved 96.5% and 95.2% accuracy, respectively, with F1-scores of 94.6% and 93.1%, balancing precision and recall. The edge-sharing network demonstrated strong performance in response time, throughput, packet loss, and latency. Additionally, the blockchain-based transaction verification system achieved 99.9% accuracy, excelling in verification speed, network latency, and throughput.},

  abstract = {The digital transformation of power systems necessitates robust solutions for data security challenges, such as provenance verification, tamper resistance, and privacy compliance. This research proposes a novel blockchain-based architecture integrated with threshold proxy re-encryption (TPRE) to establish a trustworthy electricity data ecosystem. The framework transforms grid devices and organizational units into permissioned blockchain nodes, creating an immutable ledger for end-to-end data provenance while preventing unauthorized modifications. Regulatory entities gain granular traceability capabilities to audit data flows and pinpoint anomalous nodes with cryptographic certainty. To address the dual requirements of multi-party data sharing and privacy protection in smart grid environments, we implement an optimized TPRE scheme that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional approaches. Our solution enables secure delegation of re-encryption rights while maintaining threshold-based access control over sensitive power consumption data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces computational overhead by 33.3% under multi-user scenarios compared to conventional proxy re-encryption methods, while enhancing key randomness through threshold-based secret sharing. The proposed framework offers practical insights for implementing cryptographically secure, regulator-compliant data management systems in critical energy infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Given the challenges in capturing temporal dependencies within sports event data and the imbalance between global and local feature representations, this study introduces a Transformer-based model designed to address these issues. By leveraging a multi-head self-attention mechanism, the model effectively captures dynamic features across different time granularities, thereby enhancing the analysis of temporal event data and improving the accuracy of win rate prediction. Specifically, a time-segment encoding strategy is first employed to partition the event sequence data, enabling independent processing of features within each temporal segment. Subsequently, a multi-level Transformer architecture is constructed to extract both short-term and long-term dependencies at different hierarchical levels, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of game dynamics. To further refine feature representation, a dynamic self-attention adjustment mechanism is incorporated, allowing the model to adaptively focus on salient features based on the characteristics of the input data. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with baseline models—including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—the proposed model achieves superior performance. Specifically, it improves prediction accuracy by 10.7%, 8.3%, 3.9%, 6.0%, 4.3%, and 2.4%, respectively, and enhances precision by 10.6%, 9.4%, 5.0%, 6.5%, 4.5%, and 3.6%, respectively.

  abstract = {Background:
            Although cloud computing has been increasingly adopted in university information systems to support teaching, research, and administration, existing cloud service platforms still face significant challenges in two key dimensions: intelligent resource scheduling and comprehensive security protection.
            Problem:
            Most current resource allocation strategies rely on static models or heuristic-based rules, which lack adaptive capabilities in dynamic and high-load environments. Simultaneously, existing cloud security mechanisms often focus on traditional encryption methods or basic access control, which are insufficient for protecting sensitive data in open, high concurrency subsystems such as digital libraries.
            Proposed solution:
            To address these gaps, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture optimization and deep security design scheme tailored for university cloud platforms. The core innovation lies in the integrated application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and advanced cryptographic frameworks to achieve dynamic, secure, and efficient service delivery.
            Methodology:
            DRL is employed to build a system-aware, environment-adaptive resource scheduling algorithm that maps complex system states to optimal resource configurations in real time. For the security framework, this paper introduces a multi-layered encryption and access control strategy: attribute-based encryption (ABE) ensures secure data transmission, while the scheme is extended to Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy ABE (MABE) based on the Ring-LWE assumption, enabling decentralized identity access management (IAM) with formal security guarantees. In addition, a K-Means-based network log analysis mechanism is developed for real-time detection and classification of user behavior and potential attacks, forming a closed-loop system of threat perception, behavior recognition, and active response.
            Results:
            The experimental results show that the K-Means + ABE attribute-based encryption algorithm can be applied to the network information security management of LAN in terms of data. Compared with the classical heuristic-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and greedy algorithm, the fitness function value of the new algorithm in this paper is 4.4% and 5.6% higher on average, respectively, which can effectively balance the demand for QoS and resource cost.
            Significance:
            Therefore, the optimization scheme is superior to the traditional architecture design in response efficiency, resource utilization, and security performance. This paper provides a feasible theoretical basis and technical path for the construction of cloud platform under the background of university digital transformation.},

A three-dimensional composite indicator system (“financial robustness–strategic credibility–environmental resilience”) is developed to compare the predictive performance of Logit models and backpropagation (BP) neural networks in estimating corporate default probabilities. Empirical findings reveal: (1) Under the composite indicator system, the BP neural network achieves 81.7% default prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the Logit model (72.4%), with a 32-percentage-point improvement in identifying defaulted entities; (2) Using single financial indicators, the BP network maintains superiority (58.3% overall accuracy vs 48.3% for Logit), validating its capacity to capture complex risk features; (3) The composite system enhances prediction accuracy by 23.4% (BP) and 24.1% (Logit) compared to single indicators, demonstrating the early-warning value of non-financial metrics. These results suggest that the synergistic application of multi-source composite indicators and BP neural networks substantially improves the precision of dynamic credit risk assessment in the NEV sector, offering methodological support for differentiated financial services and regulatory oversight.},

Deep representation learning extracts the system features; causal inference reveals the causal relationship between variables, so enhancing the operability and assessment accuracy. Specifically, the intelligent assessment method proposed in this study achieves a mean square error (MAE) of 0.149, which is significantly lower than other traditional methods. In terms of causal effect estimation, the estimation of this method is 0.92, which is much higher than other models.

The module uniquely combines down-sampling and up-sampling operations within a single convolution block to capture both local and global contexts, addressing key limitations in existing methods. In addition, an improved Dice loss function is proposed, which integrates both under- and over-segmentation penalties through an mDice loss. This is combined with a cross-entropy loss based on classification to optimize segmentation performance. The proposed self-correcting convolution segmentation algorithm demonstrates superior accuracy in segmenting lung infection regions compared to existing methods, particularly the AMSU-Net network. Experimental results indicate that the inclusion of multi-scale spatial information and refined loss functions significantly enhances segmentation precision. The novelty of this research lies in the introduction of a self-correcting convolution module that improves the receptive field and the diversity of extracted features. Furthermore, the enhanced mDice loss function, integrating segmentation penalties, contributes to improved model performance.

As people experience greater material comfort, they increasingly seek deeper, more emotionally intelligent ways to interact with technology. Music, rich in emotional content, serves as a powerful medium for interpersonal communication and is increasingly regarded as a natural channel for intelligent human-computer interaction. However, traditional music emotion recognition techniques face challenges with low recognition accuracy and high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient deep learning-based music emotion recognition system that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) within an IoT framework. The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract both local and global features from musical signals using Mel-frequency techniques. These features enhance the GAN’s ability to detect complex emotional expressions in music. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significantly lower error rates and greater recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it attains an accuracy of 94.06%, confirming its effective performance and suitability for real-time, emotion-aware music recommendation in IoT applications.},

This paper addresses a dual-side coordinated control strategy that combines an advanced finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with impedance matching for LCC-LCC compensated WPT systems, aiming to enhance dynamic performance and optimize efficiency. Firstly, the secondary-side rectifier employs FCS-MPC combined with phase shift modulation (PSM) to achieve rapid voltage tracking. An improved FCS-MPC method is proposed featuring a novel iterative approach, adaptive compensation, and a multi-objective optimization cost function to simultaneously improve system stability, responsiveness, and computational efficiency. Secondly, the primary-side inverter combines impedance matching with PSM to track the point of maximum system efficiency. Finally, model verification results substantiate the viability of the developed strategy. Under sudden load and input voltage changes, improved MPC reduces overshoot and settling time by nearly 60% and 70%, respectively, compared to PI control. Additionally, system efficiency optimizes by approximately 1.3% through impedance matching.},

These features are further processed through a multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal dependencies. The proposed multimodal weighted network (MWN) dynamically fuses the prediction probabilities from both modalities, enhancing sentiment recognition performance. Experimental validation on the public CMU-MOSI dataset demonstrates that TA-MWN outperforms traditional unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Further evaluation on a self-constructed online learning dataset confirms the model’s superior adaptability and recognition accuracy, achieving over 90% accuracy in negative sentiment detection.

  abstract = {The blast furnace bag filter is an essential equipment for filtering flue gas and recovering dust. Optimising its structure can enhance gas recovery efficiency, reduce resource waste, and mitigate environmental pollution. This study designed three types of blast furnace metal bag filters with varying inlet and outlet structures and analysed their flow field distribution characteristics using computational fluid dynamics. The results indicated that the airflow was most efficient with the configuration of a lower inlet and upper outlet on the same side (Case A). However, Case A exhibited significant flow fluctuations in the filter bag area and slightly higher wall stress compared to the middle inlet structure (Case B). While the airflow in Case B's filter bag area was relatively uniform, there was strong disturbance at the ash hopper, hindering the efficiency of ash deposition. In addition, Case C, featuring a lower intake on one side and an upper outlet, demonstrated the poorest flow performance. Therefore, Case A was deemed the most scientifically optimal structure for the actual industry. Additionally, the study examined the impact of inlet velocity on flow characteristics in Case A. As the inlet velocity increased from 9.8 to 29 m/s, the flow velocity in the ash hopper area rose from 2.57 to 6.01 m/s, with a marked increase in jet intensity.},

In this regard, employing holistic approaches can aid the teacher by providing an enhanced comprehension of the students’ state, as well as the affective process involved. To this end, the current conceptual article illustrates the use of the Iceberg model of Systems Thinking and the Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT) model of Bronfenbrenner's Bio-ecological theory; the efficacy of both instruments is established via appropriate arguments. The mental model layer of the Iceberg framework enables a teacher to directly discern the affective values involved in a scenario, likewise, the PPCT model allows to observe the transparency of the mechanism being used to deliver/assess an affective attribute. Thus a duo of potent tools is added in the toolbox of an affective domain teacher, who may proceed with a clearer vision and enhanced confidence.},

It teaches us that attending to respectful relationships on stolen land is an active and ongoing responsibility of continuing connections with and as Country. As we grapple with the complexities of what it means for each of us to be in respectful relationship with Country, we recognise that there is an urgent need to attend to Land Back as part of the process.},

Nevertheless, the Ti6A14V alloy has many shortcomings, including a lack of antimicrobial activity, which raises the risk of implant failure and cellular toxicity. Considering this, research is being done to determine whether the cefotaxime (CTX) may efficiently suppress the corrosion of Ti6A14V alloy in artificial saliva solution using potentiodynamic polarisation curves, open-circuit potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As the inhibitor's concentration rose, so did the inhibition efficiency, achieving 82.0% at 600 ppm. The investigated CTX functions as a mixed-type inhibitor. Additionally, the adsorption of the CTX inhibitor followed the Langmuir isotherm. The temperature increased the corrosion current (

This study enhances the allocation and administration of English translation resources in cloud computing. This study enhances cloud-based English translation services and influences language translation, natural language processing, and cloud computing. This research aims to provide a pragmatic method for the complex challenge of effectively allocating and managing English translation resources inside cloud computing networks. The algorithm is used to assess allocation and management techniques based on the characteristics of the ongoing activities and the status of the cloud network. The features include the computing capacity of edge servers and devices, the quality of the communication channel, the efficacy of translation resource use, and the latency requirements of the services. The proposed model can autonomously learn about the network environment and make decisions about resource allocation to enhance performance and minimize latency. The ability of cloud computing to project future trajectories from an initial state to ascertain the ideal action by evaluating reward values is a principal benefit of the system. This capability enables the system to choose the optimal course of action. The proposed strategy achieves substantial improvements in key performance indicators, including a 36.4% reduction in average service latency, a 24.7% gain in resource utilization, and a 3.5% improvement in translation accuracy. Additionally, the approach demonstrates excellent scalability, handling increased workloads with minimal impact on performance, and reduces costs associated with translation services, making it a cost-effective solution for cloud-based translation.

However, the high temperatures and mechanical stresses characteristic of automotive environments significantly impact the reliability and operational efficiency of these chips. FSDOI physical design strategies have emerged as a viable solution for enhancing the robustness and efficacy of automotive-grade semiconductor chips. Data are collected through both computational simulations and experimental investigations. The resulting data are analyzed using a variety of statistical methods, including failure rate analysis, which compares failure rates between chips optimized with FSDOI and those without. FSDOI emphasizes the fine-tuning of several aspects of the chip’s physical design to enhance performance. Thermal dissipation, mechanical stress, and electrical density were examined under automotive operational conditions, which include significant temperature variations and high humidity levels. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a sophisticated computational tool for modeling and solving large physical problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable elements. These elements are scrutinized to predict how the chip responds to various loads, pressures, and environmental conditions. Chips manufactured using the FSDOI technique undergo experimental tests to validate simulation results, including thermal and mechanical stress testing, as well as electromigration testing. The evaluations indicate that the FSDOI technique significantly enhances chip reliability and lowers failure rates. Findings underscore the necessity of incorporating advanced design optimization strategies into automotive chip production to fulfill the stringent requirements of modern automobiles. FSDOI-optimized chips exhibit a 48.15% reduction in failure rate, a 25% increase in Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), and a 35.48% improvement in overall reliability score.

  abstract = {Research and development have demonstrated that effective building energy prediction is significant for enhancing energy efficiency and ensuring grid reliability. Many machine learning (ML) models, particularly deep learning (DL) approaches, are widely used for power or peak demand forecasting. However, evaluating prediction models solely based on accuracy is insufficient, as complex models often suffer from low interpretability and high computational costs, making them difficult to implement in real-world applications. This study proposes a multi-perspective evaluation analysis that includes prediction accuracy (both overall and at different power levels), interpretability (global/local perspectives and model structure), and computational efficiency. Three popular DL models—recurrent neural network, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, and three tree-based models—random forecast, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine—are analyzed due to their popularity and high prediction accuracy in the field of power demand prediction. The comparison reveals the following: (1) The best-performing prediction model changes under different power demand levels. In scenarios with lower power usage patterns, tree-based models achieve an average CV-RMSE of 13.62%, which is comparable to the 12.17% average CV-RMSE of DL models. (2) Global and local interpretations indicate that past power use and time-related features are the most important. Tree-based models excel at identifying which specific lagged features are more significant. (3) The DL model behavior can be interpreted by visualizing the hidden state at each layer to reveal how the model captures temporal dynamics across different time steps. However, tree-based models are more intuitive to interpret using straightforward decision rules and structures. This study provides guidance for applying ML algorithms to load forecasting, offering multiple perspectives on model selection trade-offs.},

By constructing a special data set containing 36 types of animated characters, the positive sample dynamic weighting strategy is innovatively designed to solve the inherent positive and negative sample imbalance problem of SSD model, and the receptive field enhancement module (RFB) is introduced to improve the multi-scale feature expression ability. The experiment shows that the mAP of the model increases by 13.8%. When the positive sample weight coefficient is 3, the identification effect is the best, which is 18.2% higher than that of traditional SSD. The improved SSD-RFB model detection accuracy (mAP@50 = 95.78%) and real-time (10.5 FPS) are superior to mainstream detection algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by the pose diversity of animation characters, and the synergistic effect of core modules is demonstrated through experiments.

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an essential component of the digital age, particularly in ensuring reliable and efficient operations as well as the timely and precise recognition of anomalies within IoT systems. However, anomaly detection in time-series data—especially data collected by edge devices—poses several challenges, including concerns over data privacy and communication overhead. To address these issues, this research proposes a novel deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection model capable of being trained in real-time on edge devices within an IoT environment. The framework ensures user privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to cooperatively train an anomaly recognition system. This study introduces a new, Intelligent Shark Smell Tuned Deep Isolation Forest (ISS-DIF), which effectively detects anomalies and identifies outliers in industrial IoT sensor data with high accuracy. The hybrid model isolates anomalies rather than profiling normal data, making it particularly suitable for identifying rare anomalies within large datasets. Industrial data are collected from real-world manufacturing environments using IoT edge devices. Following data collection, median filtering is applied to reduce noise, and min-max scaling is employed for data normalization. The ISS component allows for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the Deep Isolation Forest (DIF) to optimize detection performance. The DIF model is tailored to enhance anomaly detection capabilities in sensor data from industrial IoT applications. For validation, 80% of the dataset was used for training, while the remaining 20% served as the test set. The results demonstrate that the proposed ISS-DIF framework achieved superior training accuracy of 99.30%, with precision of 97.89%, recall of 98.76%, and an F1-score of 97.21%, outperforming the testing metrics. This approach integrates real-time anomaly detection with the processing capabilities of edge devices, thereby improving IoT data analytics and providing a scalable, efficient solution that preserves privacy in irregularity recognition within IoT environments.},

  abstract = {To address the disposal of lightweight materials (such as plastic, cloth and paper) in waste stocks, this study delves into the analysis of two distinct wind separation chamber structures and their respective impacts on the separation efficiency of lightweight materials. Utilizing Fluent simulation software, the structural optimization of the air chamber is conducted, scrutinizing the effects of the auxiliary tuyre angle in primary wind separation and the fan arrangement mode in secondary wind separation on the overall separation effectiveness. Various models are established to compare flow field track diagrams and velocity cloud diagrams within the wind separation room, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of how device structure influences the precision of wind separation. The simulation results reveal that, in primary wind separation, setting the auxiliary fan angle between 35° and 40° yields a more reasonable indoor flow field and velocity distribution, leading to effective separation of lightweight materials. For secondary air selection, the optimal fan arrangement mode is determined to be non-uniform, ensuring uniform wind bodies in the field with minimal cyclonic disturbances.},

  abstract = {An optimal location of perforation clusters is critical to obtain a commercial production rate in unconventional tight reservoir reservoirs. At present, the perforation cluster position design method based on overlapping induced stress between fractures is only suitable for multi-stage single-cluster fracturing in horizontal well. Under real well conditions, multiple fractures extend at the same time during multi-stage and multi-cluster fracturing, which is easy to produce stress barrier effects and stress interference effects. These problems put forward higher requirements for selecting the best position of perforating cluster. In this paper, according to the characteristics of multiple fractures extending simultaneously in one stage in multi-stage multi-cluster fracturing, the influence range of induced stress in one stage considering stress barrier and disturbance effect was analyzed. The mathematical model for calculating the induced stress at different locations in one stage is established considering the variation of effective net pressure to the surrounding formation and the resulted resulting distribution of induced stress. Based on this model, a multi-stage and multi-cluster fracture optimization design method for horizontal wells is proposed, which can effectively avoid repeated fractured and non-fractured areas by optimizing the non-equidistant locations of the perforated clusters. Case studies show that this method can effectively avoid refracturing and non-refracturing zones, thus achieving better fracturing results with lower energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Financial fraud is one of the primary threats to businesses and the economy at large, resulting in monumental financial losses, operational inefficiency, and significant damage to reputation. This research examines the use of a Multi-Technique Fraud Detection System (MTFDS) that incorporates machine vision technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), signature verification, and behavioral anomaly detection to identify and prevent financial fraud and analyze its economic impact. The fraud detection dataset contains detailed transaction data from scanned financial documents. Noise reduction is applied to the scanned financial documents using a median filter for improved OCR processing. OCR extracts and validates text from scanned invoices and bank statements. Signature verification ensures the authenticity of signed documents. A Modified White Shark Optimizer tuned Elman Spiking Neural Network (MWSO-ESNN) is proposed to detect behavioral anomalies by identifying irregular transaction patterns and visual anomalies in transaction-related images. The research also assesses the economic consequences of fraud by quantifying financial losses, operational costs, reputation damage, and market instability. Experimental results indicate that the MWSO-ESNN model achieves 99.2% accuracy, 96.7% precision, 92.5% recall, and 95.6% F1-score, outperforming Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

  abstract = {The semantic understanding and representativeness of contemporary ceramic materials are critical to advancing their artistic and functional applications in modern design. However, analyzing subtle characteristics of ceramic materials—such as texture, composition, and form—has traditionally relied on subjective techniques. This study introduces an advanced deep learning (DL) framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Elman Recurrent Neural Networks (ERNNs) to systematically assess and quantify the semantic features of modern ceramic materials. Data collected from 3D surface texture maps and high-resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images are used to train models capable of recognizing and segmenting complex microstructural patterns, including surface imperfections, crystallization stages, and fault types. The CNN model extracts hierarchical features from SEM images, while the ERNN generates synthetic high-resolution images for data augmentation, thereby improving segmentation accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform traditional methods, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 97.8%, an accuracy of 97.69%, and a precision of 95.32%. Additionally, the trained models facilitate precise reconstruction of 3D microstructures, revealing spatial distributions of phases that are challenging to capture with conventional imaging techniques. When integrated with simulation tools, this approach enhances semantic insights into ceramic materials, enabling real-time applications in ceramic design and manufacturing—thus promoting higher quality control, material innovation, and process efficiency.},

Major failures in bogie components can lead to severe vibration, performance degradation, and even catastrophic accidents such as derailments. To address this, we propose IntelliGraph-EVO, a novel fault diagnosis framework integrating an Intelligent Graph Convolutional Network (IntelliGraph) and the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO). IntelliGraph captures structural relationships between bogie components through graph convolutions, while EVO optimizes model parameters to enhance diagnostic performance using sensor-derived synthetic vibration data. Two datasets are utilized: Dataset 1 simulates seven operational conditions (normal and six fault states) at varying speeds (80–200 km/h), and Dataset 2 includes 15 conditions (14 single-fault and normal states) at a fixed 200 km/h. Raw sensor data is pre-processed via min-max normalization, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) extracts frequency-domain features. Experimental results demonstrate that IntelliGraph-EVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ICEEMDAN + 1-D CNN, achieving precision (0.995), recall (0.994), F1-score (0.994), and accuracy (0.994) for Dataset 1, and accuracy (0.993) for Dataset 2.

  abstract = {Intelligent measurement terminals (IMTs) are key components in the power grid metering system. Detecting sensitive behaviors of the applications (Apps) installed on the IMTs is an effective means to prevent malicious behaviors and ensure the safety of the power grid. However, the traditional deep learning-based methods for sensitive behavior detection often suffer from performance degradation when the Apps change their behavior pattern after porting, migration, or upgrading. Retraining the network requires large quantities of labeled data, which is usually time-consuming and costly in practice. This paper proposes a new sensitive behavior detection method for IMT Apps based on the domain adversarial neural network (DANN). First, the DANN is utilized to extract the shared features of App behaviors before and after porting, migration, or upgrading, enabling the original data to be repurposed for training the new model, thereby alleviating the insufficient training data problem. Then, the distinctive features of the sensitive behavior in the new environment are extracted and fused with the shared features in the detection process to further improve the detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method attains 91.83% in detection accuracy, 91.21% in precision, 92.61% in recall, and 91.91% in F1-score, which are better than several traditional deep learning-based methods.},

  abstract = {The capacity of fractional-order differential equations (FODEs) to simulate intricate behaviors in nonlinear dynamic systems has drawn significant interest recently. A potent tool for characterizing memory and inherited characteristics present in several physical, biological, and engineering systems, FODEs involve derivatives of arbitrary, non-integer orders, in contrast to conventional integer-order differential equations. The goal of this research is to extensively examine the stability and control techniques of nonlinear FODEs, addressing their vital significance in modeling and managing nonlinear dynamical systems. Lyapunov-based stability is used to theoretically prove a stability theorem, offering a strong basis for fractional-order (FO) system analysis. A linear state feedback controller is designed, specifically to maintain a class of FO nonlinear systems to preserve system stability. The pole placement method from linear FO control theory is used to establish a novel criterion for calculating controller gains. The suggested method makes it possible to systematically select control settings, providing accurate nonlinear dynamics stabilization. Simulation investigations on the FO chaotic Lorenz system are carried out to verify the theoretical framework, and the intended stability and control performance are obtained. The outcomes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategies, offering significant insights for advancing the understanding and function of FODEs in complex nonlinear dynamic systems.},

  abstract = {In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have significantly changed the landscape of education. Among the most promising developments is the emergence of chatbot-based language tutors, which leverage AI to offer personalized and interactive language learning experiences. These tutors can assist learners in mastering vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and conversation skills across various languages. This research examines the role of chatbot-based language tutors utilizing deep learning (DL) to facilitate English language acquisition in mobile applications. Intent categorization is a fundamental component of these systems, allowing chatbots to understand user questions and respond appropriately. To address related issues, the research created a proofreading chatbot designed to help academic authors with grammatical corrections. Data was collected from a publicly available chatbot-based English learning dataset. The data was preprocessed using stop word removal and tokenization. Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is utilized to extract features from the preprocessed data. Efficient pigeon inspired fused bidirectional long short-term memory (EPI-BiLSTM) is applied to classify the intent based on the text to determine the user’s intent. After the classification, to address data scarcity in grammatical error correction for the English language, back translation is employed as a data augmentation tool. Back translation involves translating error-prone sentences into a different language and then translating them back to the original language, generating parallel corpora with their corrected counterparts, derived from texts. The experimental results demonstrated that EPI-BiLSTM outperforms traditional algorithms based on domain (80.5%), intent (90.3%), entity (75.2%), and average accuracy (81.3%). These findings illustrate the potential of combining chatbot-based systems and DL techniques to address both proofreading and grammatical error correction challenges in mobile applications.},

The RCMP was then used to replace 20% (by mass) of cement in the production of C30-grade concrete. This research systematically investigated the effects of RCMP blending ratios on the workability and mechanical properties (at 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days) of concrete, while also elucidating the underlying mechanisms from a microstructural perspective. The results indicate that RCP and RBP exhibit irregular geometries, rough surfaces, and high water absorption. Their chemical compositions are similar to ordinary Portland cement, with RBP demonstrating higher secondary hydration activity than RCP. The incorporation of RCMP reduced both the workability and mechanical performance of concrete. However, at an RCP:RBP ratio of 2:8, the composite powder effectively leveraged the filler effect and pozzolanic properties. Compared to the reference group, the 90-day compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength decreased by only 9.86%, 4.05%, and 1.75%, respectively, while the failure process and modes remained consistent with standard concrete. Furthermore, the T2 relaxation spectrum of RCMP-modified concrete resembled that of the reference group, primarily exhibiting four peaks. The addition of RCMP optimized the pore size distribution within the concrete matrix, enhancing its overall compactness.},

                Democratic interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: This group aligns with Ambedkar’s emphasis on democracy as a means to empower marginalized communities. They view capitalism as a system that can coexist with social justice if regulated effectively. Their focus lies in harnessing democratic institutions to address economic disparities.
              
              
                Capitalist interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: In contrast, this interpretation advocates for a more proactive engagement with capitalism. They argue that economic development and entrepreneurship can uplift Dalits, aligning with Ambedkar’s belief in self-reliance. Their perspective seeks to leverage capitalist principles for Dalit advancement.
              
              
                Marxist interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: This faction aligns with the principles of Marxism, seeing capitalism as inherently exploitative. They draw from Ambedkar’s critiques of caste-based economic discrimination and advocate for a radical transformation of the economic system, aiming for socialist alternatives.

  abstract = {Frogeye leaf spot (FLS) is common in soybean cultivation and severely affects yield. Management practices for this disease include breeding resistant cultivars and applying fungicides. However, researchers often rely on traditional methods, such as visual identification, which are subjective and prone to errors. Machine vision and machine learning offer an alternative for FLS detection. This study proposed a segmentation method to extract disease spots from soybean leaves, using the hyper-green algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). A dataset consisting of 313 soybean leaf images, annotated with disease spots, was created. The PSO algorithm trained the data using a two-stage search strategy, comprising a coarse search phase and a fine search phase. The objective was to reduce the area discrepancy between predicted and annotated images by optimizing the weight values of the color components in the hyper-green algorithm. After optimization, the disease-to-leaf area ratio accuracy enhanced from 68.45% to 98.87%. The segmented images were analyzed, with 51 features extracted to construct a classification model. Three machine learning methods—random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—were utilized to create classification models for FLS, with all models optimized by the Bayesian optimizer. The RF and XGBoost models achieved accuracies of 94.76% and 94.22%, respectively, while the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.07%. The results indicate that this method serves as a reliable tool for the automated identification of FLS, enhancing both the efficiency and precision of soybean disease detection.},

Focusing on the writing characteristics of Chinese handwriting, we have designed a new edge description feature called directional pixel angle (abbreviated as DPA). The motivation for this feature comes from forensic handwriting analysis, where the long basic strokes in Chinese characters typically have a habitual inclination angle that is highly correlated with the writer’s identity. This paper focuses on four basic strokes in Chinese characters—horizontal, vertical, left-falling, and right-falling—and calculates the relative positional relationships of the edge pixels of these strokes.

Existing research predominantly employs static weight allocation methods, which face limitations such as neglecting the dynamic evolution of market demands, bias from subjective experience, and challenges in quantifying environmental indicators. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a method that integrates fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to determine and predict the final importance of customer requirements in Quality Function Deployment for Environment (QFDE). First, by incorporating the expert experience of the QFD team, the customer preferences are combined with expert experience to correct situations where the importance is zero, determining the basic importance affecting customer requirements; then, based on the fuzzy data envelopment analysis method, the competitive differences of enterprises are evaluated from four aspects: the improvement ratio of customer green demand satisfaction, the feasibility of achieving the improvement goals for customer green demand satisfaction, the selling points of customer green demand, and the ability of enterprises to meet the environmental demand, in order to obtain correction factors for the basic importance, and then correct the basic importance to obtain the final importance of customer requirements; on this basis, the LSSVM model is introduced to predict the corrected final importance in order to grasp the trend of customer requirement changes. Finally, through the case verification, it is found that the final importance changes significantly within the tracking period, only

This paper proposes a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework to enhance semantic consistency in video captioning by improving the alignment between visual and textual representations. The proposed method incorporates a dual-branch contrastive learning strategy that refines feature extraction from both video and text modalities while enforcing a fine-grained semantic matching mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic consistency loss function to penalize mismatches between generated captions and their corresponding video content. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions.

  abstract = {Human motion synthesis plays a central role in film and animation, where motion quality influences both narrative coherence and perceptual realism. While data-driven deep learning models have shown promise in automating motion generation, they often lack biomechanical fidelity, leading to physically implausible results such as limb distortion and foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose BCMG-Net, a Biomechanically Constrained Motion Generation Network that embeds anatomical and kinetic priors into a Transformer-based architecture. Our model integrates bone length preservation, dynamic smoothness, and energy efficiency constraints directly into the training objective, ensuring structural consistency and motion naturalness. Moreover, semantic control vectors enable context-aware generation for diverse cinematic actions. Experiments conducted on Human3.6 M, CMU MoCap, and a curated film motion dataset demonstrate that BCMG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple biomechanical and perceptual metrics. Joint range heatmaps, center of mass trajectories, and motion embedding analyses further validate the physical coherence of the generated motion. These results establish BCMG-Net as a practical and principled framework for physically grounded motion synthesis in high-fidelity digital storytelling.},

  abstract = {Amidst the burgeoning advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence, strategic decision support systems for enterprises are witnessing transformative shifts. Leveraging sophisticated techniques in transfer learning and knowledge tracking algorithms, the precision and efficacy of managing enterprise risks are markedly enhanced. Consequently, this study introduces the T-DKVMN framework, an integration of Dynamic Memory Network (DKVMN) with transfer learning aimed at refining intelligent decision support systems for enterprises, particularly addressing challenges in risk identification and decision-making support. Initially, the framework harnesses pre-existing databases and labels for model pre-training, subsequently transferring the parameters from the pre-trained DKVMN model to the designated domain task via the transfer learning mechanism. This is followed by real-time updates and optimization of risk assessments using dynamic knowledge tracking. Post the pre-training and parameter transfer, the framework progresses to model training utilizing bespoke datasets and specific target labels, thus facilitating precise identification and management of enterprise risks. Experimental findings demonstrate the robust performance of the T-DKVMN framework across both public datasets and practical deployments, with risk assessment accuracy surpassing prevalent risk management methodologies. These results offer vital technical insights and a benchmark for future enhancements in intelligent enterprise decision support systems.},

As system complexity and bandwidth demands increase, the integration of mixed optoelectronic circuit switching and optical packet switching flows has become essential, particularly in high-performance array processors. This paper investigates adaptive transmission strategies for such mixed data flows from three key perspectives. Firstly, we analyze the architecture and performance of an optoelectronic hybrid H-tree network, focusing on its ability to support high-bandwidth and low-latency communication within array processor environments. Secondly, we design a hybrid switching router capable of dynamically managing both circuit-switched and packet-switched traffic, optimizing resource allocation and network efficiency. Thirdly, we examine inter-cluster data exchange mechanisms, ensuring efficient and reliable communication between processing clusters across the hybrid network. Through these studies, we aim to provide insights into the design and optimization of adaptive optoelectronic hybrid switching for next-generation array processor interconnection networks.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a green logistics optimization model leveraging IoT data for route planning and energy efficiency in smart cities. The primary objective of this model is to address the traffic scheduling challenges in automated logistics transportation, enhance transportation efficiency, and minimize energy consumption. A novel model integrating the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) is proposed. SSA is first employed to optimize route planning, taking into account environmental factors such as traffic congestion, thereby providing a globally optimized initial solution. Subsequently, Bi-GRU adjusts the route in real-time according to historical data, including vehicle speed and cargo status. This integration fully exploits the complementary advantages of the two algorithms: SSA’s global optimization ability and Bi-GRU’s dynamic adjustment based on time-series information. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of this method can significantly reduce the unit transportation time of goods by 38.75% and the unit transportation energy consumption of goods by 23%. Finally, the paper explores the prospects of green logistics development based on Internet of Things technology in the development of smart cities, offering insights for future research and practical applications.},

To bridge this methodological gap, this investigation develops SAM-Fuse – a Context-Augmented Multimodal Fusion framework that establishes dynamic cross-modal integration between textual semantics, paralinguistic features, and visual prosodic cues. Our architecture incorporates three innovation pillars: (1) A hierarchical semantic encoder with contextual augmentation, (2) An attention-based modality fusion gate with adaptive weighting, and (3) Cross-modal rhythm pattern distillation. Rigorous evaluations across multimodal speech corpora demonstrate statistically significant improvements (

In this work, we propose the BioSensor-Transformer, a novel Transformer-based deep learning architecture explicitly incorporating biomechanical constraints and multimodal sensor integration to predict injury risk during dynamic human movements. The model integrates inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), and plantar pressure sensor data, enhanced by biomechanical constraints that promote stable joints, smooth muscle motion, and efficient energy use. Extensive experimental validation on benchmark-aligned synthetic datasets demonstrates that BioSensor-Transformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.94, F-AUC: 0.83) and exhibiting physiologically plausible outputs. Moreover, our model provides enhanced interpretability through physiologically grounded attention mechanisms, enabling clear, actionable insights for clinicians.

  abstract = {Accurate time-series classification (TSC) remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning due to the complexity and variability of temporal patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU have shown promise in modeling sequential dependencies, they often suffer from limitations like vanishing gradients and high computational cost when handling long sequences. To overcome these issues, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the Inception architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives due to their ability to capture multiscale local patterns efficiently. In this study, we propose InceptionResNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates the residual learning mechanism of ResNet into the InceptionTime architecture. By replacing the fully convolutional network (FCN) shortcut module in InceptionFCN with ResNet-50, the model gains deeper representational capacity and improved gradient flow during training. We conduct extensive experiments on the UCR-85 benchmark dataset, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, including InceptionTime, InceptionFCN, ResNet, FCN, and MLP. The results show that InceptionResNet achieves superior accuracy on 49 of 85 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse and complex time series data.

  abstract = {The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness of results when machine learning and natural language processing tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a ’human-in-the-loop’ methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using machine learning and natural language processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for computational grounded theory that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while maintaining the rigour of established grounded theory methodologies. To illustrate the framework’s value, we present the results of testing it on a dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors’ experiences in the gig economy.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades across New South Wales and Queensland, koala populations have been in steep decline. Despite being nationally listed as Endangered in 2022, populations have not been stabilised and threats to the long-term survival of koalas remain. Climate change predictions suggest that human-occupied coastal habitats may offer greater protection to koalas from natural disasters such as drought and wildfires, presenting a role for people to play in koala conservation. However, the design of conservation programs is rarely informed by the affected audiences themselves, lowering their probability for success. Acknowledging the need to centre approaches on people who don’t typically think about conservation, this study applied the 5-step design thinking process, a participatory research method focused on driving innovation. A one-day design thinking workshop was conducted in September 2024. Seven design teams were formed and tasked with developing an initiative to support the reporting of koala sightings through citizen science. Each team included participants with diverse experience and expertise, ensuring balanced representation across roles. During the design process, teams received feedback from a citizen jury before presenting final pitches. Citizen jurors were individuals with no prior experience in citizen science or koala conservation. Every participant was given a budget to invest in their favourite design. The top three citizen science program concepts featured customised apps with functionality such as auto-recording koalas, sharing information with other users, and fostering social connectivity. The juries’ selections focused on business partnerships, incentives, and tailored information for users. Notably, the jury selections did not overlap with the top three designs chosen by workshop participants. The inclusion of a citizen jury in a one-day design thinking workshop is a novel contribution. The utility of design thinking as a participatory method is discussed alongside the study’s limitations, offering avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Background:
            By combining existing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data with the economic conditions of different regions, we can better understand disease trends and make more accurate estimations, facilitating effective public health interventions. Medical institutions can consequently allocate resources more efficiently. For patients, this helps lower disease risk and reduce the overall disease burden in affected areas.
          
          
            Methods:
            We analyzed health patterns in 204 countries using GBD 2021 methodologies and conducted separate analyses of disease burden in China and worldwide. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs). We further assessed disease status by incorporating Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) values. In addition, we used Mendelian randomization to identify factors leading from falls to thoracic rib fractures, and we investigated the key protein involved in thoracic rib fractures through detection of 4907 plasma proteins.
          
          
            Results:
            From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) generally showed an upward trend, although male ASIR, and ASPR displayed a slight decline. In China, however, ASIR and ASPR reached a turning point in 2000, dipped in 2005, then trended upward again. Morbidity and prevalence were negatively correlated with SDI. Based on Mendelian randomization analyses, falls leading to thoracic rib fractures were linked to education level and osteoporosis. Moreover, HAMP was identified as the key protein in thoracic rib fractures.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            As global populations age, analyzing the global burden of thoracic rib fractures caused by falls from 1990 to 2021 can help guide the development of effective public health prevention strategies and optimize the allocation of existing medical resources.},

First, the finite element method (FEM) in Abaqus software was used to model the effects of 10 muscle and joint forces across various regions of the femur. Then, using the response surface methodology (RSM), and examining the effect coefficients of each joint and muscle force, the hip joint reaction force with an impact coefficient of 210.97 was identified as the most effective force on bone stress. After that, the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius muscle forces were ranked second and third in terms of stress effect with coefficients of 66.6 and 34.47. This study showed that the anterior femoral muscles have a significant effect on stress compared to the posterior femoral muscles. RSM enables faster and more precise identification of joint and muscle forces influencing femoral stresses compared to conventional methods. This innovative approach not only increased the understanding of biomechanical phenomena, but also provided a more efficient tool for investigating and optimizing such processes in biomedical engineering applications.},

  abstract = {Fluency in mathematics has several implications for success in future mathematics courses, daily living skills, and future employment opportunities. The current single-case design study explored the effects of mathematics games on student multiplication or subtraction fluency. Three students with developmental disabilities completed the intervention in which they played a digital mathematical game for 10 minutes and researchers explored the effect on student fluency, operationalized as correct digits per minute (cdpm). While researchers were unable to determine a functional relation between the game and students’ cdpm, the three students who completed the study were successful in increasing their fluency and maintaining their fluency higher than baseline levels. Students reported they enjoyed playing the game and would rather play math games than complete worksheets.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a liver image segmentation method based on the EABRDeNet model, which incorporates the architectural concept of U-Net. In the encoding stage, EfficientNet-B0 serves as the backbone network, combined with the SEBlock mechanism and residual blocks to enhance the extraction of key liver features and address gradient-related issues. In the decoding stage, deconvolution and upsampling are used for precise segmentation. Liver images from open-source websites are pre-processed and data-augmented to construct the G dataset. The EABRDeNet model is trained on this dataset, and segmentation results are obtained through the weight-sharing mechanism. To verify the model’s effectiveness, comparative experiments are conducted on the G dataset with U-Net and U-Net + Dice_Focal_Loss. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and Dice coefficient are used for evaluation. The experimental results show that the EABRDeNet model outperforms the other two models. Specifically, on the training set, the EABRDeNet model has an average loss of 0.0025979, an average accuracy of 0.9876249, and an average Dice coefficient of 0.985658. On the test set, the average loss is 0.0029967, the average accuracy is 0.987649, and the average Dice coefficient is 0.9845206. In contrast, the U-Net model and U-Net + Dice_Focal_Loss model have relatively higher losses and lower accuracies and Dice coefficients, indicating that the EABRDeNet model has better performance and stability in liver image segmentation tasks.},

However, optimizing packing density while maintaining superior magnetic properties remains a challenge, particularly for high-efficiency magnetic cores in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. This study addresses this challenge by integrating discrete element method simulations, machine learning, and experimental validations to optimize powder packing density and evaluate its impact on magnetic properties. Tri-modal amorphous powders were mixed at various ratios, achieving over 90% relative density with derived ratios by machine learning, significantly outperforming conventional trail-and-error methods. Enhanced core density improved magnetic properties, including a 49.7% reduction in coercivity and an 8.72% increase in saturation magnetization. These improvements were attributed to reduced porosity and optimized compaction strategies. Core loss analysis further demonstrated lower hysteresis and eddy current losses in high-density cores.},

A countermeasure quadrilateral is then constructed to determine the optimal development strategy for cultural and tourism integration in the town. The results indicate that the total intensity of opportunities is 1.493, the total intensity of advantages is 1.274, the total intensity of disadvantages is −0.292, and the total intensity of threats is −0.288.

Firstly, leveraging speech recognition and natural language processing techniques, we utilize the BERT model to encode the text data of lines, followed by the Bi-GRU model for emotion classification. The results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy for exciting, sadness, and angry emotions exceeds 80%.

In the occurrence of Cattaneo-Christov mass and heat flux, mathematical modeling and analysis have been performed. This model is useful for optimizing the design of systems that involve non-Newtonian fluids, like oil drilling, polymer extrusion, and chemical reactors. To optimize thermal management in high-performance machinery, it aids in a more precise knowledge of heat and mass transport mechanisms. This model can be applied to environmental processes such as the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere or the cooling of electronic equipment, where fluid dynamics and heat regulation play crucial roles, by incorporating dust particles and surface tension gradients. For both liquid and dust particle phases, the governing non-linear PDEs (partial differential equations) are composed of the principles of momentum, mass, energy, and solutal conservation. By using the similarity variable, PDEs can be transmuted into ODEs (ordinary differential equations). The numerical results of the governing equations are obtained using the shooting approach (RKF-45th). The skin friction, fluid and dust velocity distributions grow as the value of the Stephen blowing parameter upsurges while decline the rate of heat and mass transmission.},

Working from the disciplines of geography and anthropology and from different – and in some respects, even opposed – theoretical starting places, we explore the tensions that arise among competing critical materialisms when the radical differences of nonterrestrial places form the contexts for social, political-economic, and human-nonhuman relations and relationality.

  abstract = {High-speed railways are highly sensitive to mining-induced subsidence, making the identification of goafs along railway corridors and impact assessment crucial for construction and operation. This study investigates the Weiyuan section of the Chengdu-Kunming High-Speed Railway traversing a low-mountain coal mining area. An integrated approach combining historical data, drilling surveys, InSAR monitoring, and theoretical modeling was used to map mineral resources, mining activities, goafs, and surface deformations. Then, an evaluation framework for assessing the potential impact of goaf on railway engineering stability is established, thereby evaluating the potential threat of goaf. Findings indicate that the overlying thick-bedded sandstone layer (∼129 m) above the goaf significantly mitigates the transmission of deformation from the goaf to the surface. InSAR monitoring spanning from November 2016 to April 2024 reveal that historical mining caused minor subsidence (&lt;10 mm/yr), with current deformation rates generally within ±10 mm/yr. Empirical calculations indicate a safe mining depth threshold of 96 m, while actual depths significantly exceed this value, posing minimal railway risks. By calculating the influence angle of the subsidence basin and analyzing its relationship with the railway alignment, the study identifies that the direct impact of goafs is primarily concentrated in the Bakubutian coal mine areas. Based on these findings, targeted risk mitigation strategies are proposed to ensure the long-term safety and stability of railway engineering. This study provides scientific support for the Chengdu-Kunming Railway’s safety and offers transferable methodologies for railway projects in similar mining-affected regions, emphasizing the importance of integrated geological-engineering assessments in infrastructure planning.},

  abstract = {A novel fault diagnosis approach for rotor systems experiencing pedestal looseness is introduced, utilizing complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to address this mechanical issue. In cases of pedestal looseness, rotor system vibration signals predominantly consist of three constituent elements: periodic components reflecting rotational frequency and harmonic content, transient impact components carrying fault characteristics, and stochastic noise interference. The CEEMDAN technique is employed to isolate and enhance the diagnostically critical impact elements within these complex vibration signals, followed by application of envelope demodulation analysis to process the extracted transient features. The diagnostic identification of pedestal looseness is ultimately achieved through characteristic periodicity detection in the resulting envelope spectrum. Validation through both simulated signal analysis and practical experimental investigations confirms the technical efficacy of this methodology for detecting pedestal looseness faults in rotating machinery rotor systems, maintaining fidelity to original operational data throughout the analytical process.},

  abstract = {Objective
            Recent studies show that the personality factors such as neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are linked to depression. This paper presents a computational model, PDScore, to explore the relationship between personality traits and depression scores obtained from an analysis of social media text by monitoring individuals’ social media posts over a specified time frame.
          
          
            Method
            The study aims to understand how different personality traits influence depression levels. Using the 3-D psychological theory (VAD) proposed by Mehrabian as a foundation, initial depression scores are derived. Subsequent analysis employs fuzzy logic to account for uncertainty arising from personality variability, resulting in refined depression score estimations.
          
          
            Results
            Validation is performed in two ways: using the eRisk2018 Dataset and Expert-Supervised Validation Using Psychometric Tools. First, the results are compared with eRisk2018 datasets and compared with the existing models. The proposed model outperformed all the existing methods with 0.84 F1-score. Then, a data is collected from 57 participants with approximately 35 to 40 posts per participant, resulting in a total of over 2150 posts. we applied our method to compute corresponding depression scores and compared them with the psychologists’ assessments. It demonstrates a correlation of 0.985 between the manual score and final depression score. The comparison yielded an accuracy of 94.7% in classification and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.089, indicating strong alignment and reinforcing the empirical validity of the proposed model. We consider this initial study a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the feasibility and potential of integrating personality factors and linguistic features for depression scoring.
          
          
            Conclusions

However, a significant gap remains between their performance and theoretical potential, highlighting the urgent need to enhance our understanding of the process-structure-performance relationship. Computational simulations, with their ability to provide analysis from the atomic level to higher-scale, are essential for bridging this gap. This review provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in computational simulation techniques to produce high-performance PANCFs by optimizing the process parameters through simulations. Furthermore, advancements in reactive molecular dynamics, density functional theory, atomistic modelling, and finite element methods to enhance the PANCFs manufacturing process are systematically evaluated. Simulations play an important role in developing PANCFs by identifying novel comonomers for PAN precursors, evaluating different solvents during spinning, precise tracking of cyclization and dehydrogenation mechanisms during stabilization, and predicting mechanical property losses due to defects. Moreover, it is demonstrated that how kinetics-driven frameworks accelerate carbonization simulations by combining atomic-scale interactions such as carbon ring formation and graphitic growth with macroscale process parameters like temperature and pressure. However, certain limitations remain: unresolved heterogeneous microstructure representation, multiscale disconnects between atomic bond-breaking and macroscopic fiber evolution, and validation barriers due to oversimplified quasi-2D models. To overcome these problems, possible future directions including advanced force fields, multiscale integration, and AI-driven modeling could enhance the performance of PANCFs.},

However, existing deep learning methods still face the problem of poor homography estimation when handing images with complex backgrounds, resulting in ghosting artifacts in the stitching results. In this paper, we propose an image stitching method based on multi-stage feature matching and GAN for autonomous vehicles. It consists of a stitching network, an optimization network, and a GAN framework. The stitching network employs deformable convolutions to match the nonlinear contour features of the same object among images from different viewpoints, and extract the homography relationship to warp the images and perform dynamic fusion. The optimization network adopts a skip connection structure to fuses feature maps of different scales. To further improve visual quality of image stitching, a GAN framework is employed to provide feedback to the model during the training process and guide it to produce seamless image stitching results. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed image stitching method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Introducing the parametric design method into the field of graphic design has become an important topic in future graphic design research. In order to improve the effective integration of graphic design education and science and technology, this paper applies the color perception evaluation model based on computer vision to graphic design education. Aiming at the problems that traditional algorithms can’t adaptively extract the main color of images and the lack of evaluation indexes for intelligent color collocation effect, this paper proposes a color collocation evaluation method that integrates visual perception and similarity measurement, and an intelligent color collocation algorithm that integrates visual aesthetics. Through quantitative detection and subjective evaluation, it is shown that the test results of this method have high palette similarity with the source palette and have good effects in graphic design education, which can provide relatively good technical support for subsequent graphic design education. Compared with the Pix2Pix network model that does not integrate visual aesthetics, the method proposed in this paper has a certain improvement in both comprehensive evaluation index and peak signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the method proposed in this article has improved subjective preference compared to the Pix2Pix network model that does not integrate visual aesthetics and is of certain significance to promote the intelligent development of subsequent graphic design education.},

By constructing a university English grammar teaching program based on six strategies, the effects of antecedent, mediator, and outcome variables on teaching innovation were analyzed and five hypotheses about the interactions of these variables were formulated. The model was validated using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) algorithm. The predictive power of models 1–3 on teaching innovation was 0.024, 0.046, and 0.607, respectively. Expressive ability, language culture, internal and external classroom environment, and teaching style all positively influenced teaching innovation, with regression coefficients of 0.436, 0.061, −0.146, and 0.396, respectively. But the expressive ability and teaching style were significant, while the remaining two dimensions were not significant. The results of the path analysis showed that all the hypotheses in the model were tested and the path coefficients obtained from the test, and the corresponding chi-square significance coefficients met the requirements.

Nevertheless, conventional load prediction techniques often suffer from issues such as limited accuracy and high volatility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a load prediction approach based on Transformer multi-model fusion, employing a Stacking ensemble learning framework to integrate multiple models, including Transformer, XGBoost, and GDBT. The method also takes into account key influencing factors, such as meteorological conditions and holidays. Specifically, it involves training and predicting from the original features, followed by utilizing Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to capture feature relationships and long-term dependencies, ultimately leading to more precise load predictions. Empirical results validate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy and stability across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over single-model approaches and conventional techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to establish a predictive model for hydro turbine failures by simulating rare real-world data using a digital twin system. Hydro turbines play a critical role in the renewable energy sector, but their unpredictability in terms of failures results in significant maintenance and operational costs. The traditional fault prediction method based on historical data is difficult to achieve more accurate and generalized modeling, because the data in the real world cannot meet the requirements of the machine learning theory for the same distribution of data and data balance, especially some rare events are difficult to collect in reality. Therefore, in this paper, it is proposed to enhance the robustness of hydro turbine failure prediction by simulating data from some rare situations through a digital twin system. By collecting and simulating rare data from actual hydroelectric turbines, we gain a better understanding of their operational mechanisms and fault patterns. We propose a digital twin system capable of replicating real-world operating conditions in a virtual environment, which serves as the foundation for data-driven fault prediction models. Through deep learning analysis of the simulated data, we can predict the likelihood of hydro turbine failures, thus improving maintenance strategies, reducing costs, and enhancing turbine reliability. Our research offers a promising approach to addressing rare data challenges using digital twin systems and holds broad application potential within the hydropower industry.},

The platform contains a variety of proprietary seismic data in different formats and from different data sources, providing data support to realize the data modeling and business process processing of strong and impending earthquake prediction model, so as to build a new model of regional earthquake forecasting study.

  abstract = {Background
            Disease-modifying therapies for persons with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has led to greater need and demand for relevant outcomes assessments. Such tools help monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and inform clinical management. Canadian SMA clinicians participated in a Delphi process to achieve a 2021 national consensus on recommended outcomes, recognizing future reassessment would be essential given the evolving field and gaps in patient-reported and bulbar measures.
          
          
            Objective
            Derive updated Canadian consensus of recommended outcome measures for adults with SMA.
          
          
            Methods
            A national consensus workshop was held with SMA clinicians, patient/family representatives, research leaders, national registry and advocacy organizations. Clinics and registry experience and data were presented and discussed, utility of current and additional outcomes reviewed. Long and short lists of measures were generated, with voting to derive consensus.
          
          
            Results
            Practical implementation, value of data, and relevance to persons with SMA were key considerations. Consensus was achieved to ‘think outside the box’, recognizing a spectrum of function and need to choose the right outcome measure for the right patient at the right time. Measures with greater acceptance for adults were selected, and bulbar measures introduced. Eight outcome measures are recommended; 4 motor, 2 respiratory and 2 patient reported domains, with use based on the individuals level of function. The Revised Upper Limb Module was deemed to have broadest applicability except in the strongest and weakest adults. Additional measures are included as optional and exploratory.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Employing measures meaningful for clinicians, researchers, and persons living with SMA is essential to ensuring quality data collection and an engaged patient-centred clinical team. Clinicians should select measures based on the person's functional ability and goals. Building a national community of practice to support clinical and research practice, including standardized outcome measure training, will be a key next step in dissemination and advocacy.},

This approach innovatively extracts local information from songs using CNN, thereafter encoding and decoding these features globally through the self-attention mechanism of Transformers. Furthermore, it employs diverse data augmentation techniques to strengthen the model’s capacity to identify the attributes of folk song dialects and elevate its overall efficacy. The evaluations revealed that TransCNN attained a classification accuracy of 92.3%, a recall rate of 91.8%, and F1 scores of 91.9%.

Research was done using deep learning techniques in streaming media platforms to convert audio signals into Mel spectrograms for extracting audio features. Under the computation of the Mel filter, feature extraction of audio files can be input into a binary network with platform user behavior, thereby constructing a music recommendation system. Finally, the relationship learning module is utilized to integrate user behavior and audio features, combined with a music encoder to complete personalized audio feature processing, thereby achieving the construction of a music personalized recommendation system. Through dataset testing, it was found that the initial dataset had a sparsity ratio of 0.14% and a recall rate of 30.16%. In the partitioning and data analysis of the Subset dataset, it was found that the user group recommendation algorithm had the highest recommendation accuracy of 24% for Subset100 subset, and the highest recall rate was 33.5% when the number of recommendations was 50, indicating the necessity of data recommendation. In the testing of the personalized recommendation system, the training accuracy of the system was as high as 93%. Finally, different recommendation methods were compared between the Subset500 dataset and the Mirex dataset, and the research method based on audio features had the highest recommendation accuracy of 97.5%, recall rate and F1 value of 42.1% and 58.81%, respectively, and a running time of 3.2 seconds, thus proving the excellent performance.

The system architecture consists of three distinct layers: the foundational data layer, the data processing layer, and the intelligent service. The improved CGWO-KM algorithm is used to cluster project attributes, and the search and update mechanism of the gray wolf population is applied to find better initial clustering centers. Missing rating data is then filled in, and user similarity is calculated. A harmonized weighting factor is used to eliminate the correlation between ratings from different users. The weighted rating mechanism comprehensively considers both user ratings and the influence of neighboring users. The improved Pearson correlation coefficient combines the weighting factors with user similarity to obtain the final recommendation score, completing the intelligent book recommendation process for the library’s books. The results show that at the 5th month time snapshot, the predicted data (6) for the library’s historical borrowing dataset closely matches the actual value (3.7). The method proposed in this paper demonstrates an IGD mean close to the true optimal solution across various library datasets for literature, science popularization, history, art, and novels, with values of 0.0012, 0.0023, 0.0014, 0.0021, and 0.0020, respectively. The optimal non-dominated solutions in the three-dimensional space for resource utilization, recommendation diversity, and user engagement are close to the ideal value of 1. Moreover, the book recommendation system has a short processing time, and the recommendation accuracy ranges from 0.882 to 0.993, providing personalized, high-quality book recommendation services for readers.},

  abstract = {In recent years, English language teaching has undergone significant transformation due to the integration of technology and innovative teaching methodologies. Among the most promising advancements is the formation of multimodal teaching, which incorporates various forms of media. Despite the potential benefits associated with multimodal teaching, challenges remain in tailoring content to individual learning needs and optimizing the learning process for maximum effectiveness. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Multimodal English Teaching Framework (METF) to enhance the effectiveness and personalization of language learning. The framework integrates multiple teaching modalities, including text, audio, video, and interactive elements, to accommodate diverse learning preferences. It incorporates student interaction data (responses, time spent on tasks, and engagement levels), learner demographics, learning styles, and feedback records, thereby capturing the effectiveness of personalized content delivery. Pre-processing steps, including tokenization for text data, noise reduction for audio data, and normalization for resolution and interaction data, ensure data quality and consistency. Feature extraction techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for audio and video data and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text data are applied to capture meaningful patterns. To enhance the fusion of multimodal data, feature-level fusion is implemented, integrating recovered characteristics from multiple modalities into a unified representation that supports more accurate decision-making. This research establishes the Resilient Genetic Algorithm (RGA) to enhance the adaptive learning process by ensuring robustness and avoiding premature convergence. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this multimodal approach, achieving 94.2% accuracy, a convergence time of 45%, task engagement of 89.4%, and personalization effectiveness of 91.7%. These results indicate a high value of accuracy in multimodal English teaching. This research highlights the applicability of algorithms in optimizing complex, multimodal educational environments.},

This study addresses this gap by applying Word2Vec technology to analyze semantic information and emotional tendencies in student behaviors, enabling precise learning recommendations, real-time sentiment analysis, and timely interventions. A Word2Vec model is trained on extensive student data to understand learning behaviors, while a support vector machine (SVM) performs sentiment analysis to identify emotional states. Based on these insights, a personalized recommendation system dynamically adjusts resources and task difficulty to enhance learning outcomes. Experimental results show the system outperforms others, achieving recommendation accuracy of 0.81–0.87, sentiment analysis accuracy of 0.80–0.89, and an average performance improvement rate of 15.85%.

  abstract = {Sprint performance is a crucial component of athletic performance, especially in sports like track and field, football, and rugby, which require quick bursts of peak effort over short durations. Understanding the biomechanics of sprinting is essential for enhancing athletic performance, preventing injuries, and creating effective training plans. Traditional research on sprint evaluation often focuses on discrete measures while neglecting the intricate interactions between variables that evolve throughout the sprint. This study addresses these challenges by applying a machine learning (ML) algorithm, specifically the Polar Bear-tuned Multi-Source Kernel Support Vector Machine (PB-MKSVM), to predict and optimize the sprint performance of track and field athletes. The system analyzes essential biomechanical characteristics such as muscle activation patterns, joint angles, ground reaction forces, and stride length. Data were collected using wearable sensors and motion capture systems during standardized sprint trials, during which various biomechanical parameters were recorded. Standard preprocessing steps including noise removal and outlier detection were applied to the data. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was employed to extract features from the preprocessed data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in predicting sprinting efficiency and identifies complex, phase-specific changes in movement patterns. The model effectively analyzes the intricate biomechanics of sprinters’ movements to differentiate between various skill levels.

  abstract = {The quality and dependability of financial data depend on risk management in accounting systems. Traditional risk management approaches often fail to provide real-time insights into emerging risks, potentially leading to significant financial losses. Real-time analysis and decision-making are the main focus, investigating how artificial intelligence (AI) could improve risk management in accounting systems. For the precise prediction of possible risks, including fraud, errors, and financial misstatements, in accounting data, the examination suggests a hybrid Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (EFPA-GBM) model. The data was gathered, which included accounting records, financial transactions, and risk-related incidents. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing them to ensure quality, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. EFPA is utilized to improve the model’s parameters for increased accuracy, while GBM is utilized for risk prediction. This AI-driven model continually learns from data, which enables real-time risk analysis and decision-making in contrast to conventional rule-based systems.

  abstract = {Accurate PV power prediction is crucial in efficiently operating intelligent power grid systems. Data-driven approaches have shown high performance in predictive tasks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) merges deep learning with reinforcement learning and has been widely studied for optimization challenges in various fields. However, limited research has focused on applying DRL to ultra-short-term PV power prediction. Hence, a soft actor–critic (SAC) model using long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed for predicting PV power. To accomplish this, first, the PV power problem is modeled as a Markov decision process with historical weather data and PV power data as state inputs. Then, LSTM is integrated into the critic network of SAC to enhance its memory capability, thus improving prediction accuracy. Ultimately, the agent engages with the environment to address the optimization problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model attains greater prediction accuracy. This study explores the potential of DRL for PV power prediction, and the proposed method can be extended to other prediction fields, including grid prediction and wind power prediction.},

This study proposes a deep learning and reinforcement learning (DLRL) framework to enhance recommendation performance. User and video data are collected and preprocessed using the Hadoop platform, while automated metadata extraction tools, optical character recognition (OCR), and audio-to-text technologies extract multimodal features, including subtitles and audio content. A convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts semantic and visual features from text-image data, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) network captures temporal dependencies in user behavior to detect interest changes. A multimodal attention mechanism integrates these diverse features to form comprehensive user portraits, and a deep neural network (DNN) reduces feature dimensionality to represent user preferences accurately. The recommendation process is formulated as a reinforcement learning task optimized through Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior click-through rates (6.22%), viewing duration (73.31 s), accuracy (0.877), and recall (0.858), effectively overcoming cold-start limitations and dynamically adapting to evolving user interests.

This research explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating personalized training plans to improve basketball players’ abilities. Specifically, a novel Intelligent Cheetah Optimizer with Flexible Recurrent Neural Networks (ICO-FRNN) was proposed to generate training plans by identifying individual player strengths and areas for improvement. To get information from sensors during practice and competition, monitor physical performance indicators such as heart rate, speed, jump height, endurance, and biomechanical movements. The collected data undergoes preprocessing to address missing values, normalize data formats, and remove outliers by using Z-score normalization and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for feature extraction. The findings show that the ICO-RNN approach enables more intelligent, player-specific training plans, facilitating improved decision-making, skill improvement, and injury avoidance. Findings indicate that AI-driven personalized training plans result in notable performance gains when compared to conventional training regimens. The performance metrics are accuracy (0.9680), recall (0.9680), F1 score (0.9681), and precision (0.9700).

While progress is being made in integrating PV with renewable energy sources, further research is required to comprehensively understand how urban PV systems can support the grid, particularly regarding flexibility and reliability. Most prior studies have concentrated on centralized, grid-level evaluations, often neglecting urban-specific variances and the real-time challenges of grid management. Additionally, the dynamic nature of PV power production and consumption patterns in rapidly urbanizing areas poses difficulties for conventional approaches. This study aims to evaluate the grid-connected capacity of PV systems in urban environments by utilizing advanced deep learning (DL) algorithms to optimize and adjust grid connection flexibility and reliability while predicting electricity demands in these areas. The KO-DynSpikNet model is employed to analyze historical solar power data, consumption trends, and grid stability indicators. The model is trained to estimate optimal PV capacity integration for various urban locations, taking into account weather variability, changes in energy demand, and grid constraints. Sensors are utilized for data collection, while discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and min-max scaling are applied for preprocessing and feature extraction. The results indicate that the DL model offers improved forecasting accuracy for grid-connected capacity compared to conventional methods.

  abstract = {In the rapid quotation process of construction projects, low prediction accuracy and high computational complexity remain challenging issues. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel method that integrates the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets for intelligent cost prediction. Given that engineering unit prices are significantly and dynamically uncertain due to multi-source heterogeneous factors (e.g., seasonal fluctuations, regional differences, and market volatility), we construct a transformation mechanism of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This mechanism expands the traditional deterministic engineering feature matrix into an information matrix that includes hesitation degrees and membership degrees, thereby achieving a refined representation of uncertain parameters. On this basis, we introduce a multi-dimensional similarity matching algorithm to establish an accurate mapping relationship between the project under construction and the historical case library. A weighted correction prediction model based on similar cases is proposed to enhance the robustness of unit cost prediction results. Verification through multiple engineering examples demonstrates that this method provides a new prediction paradigm for engineering cost estimation, combining both theoretical rigor and practical applicability. The research conclusions offer important references for the development of intelligent cost estimation systems and the optimization of engineering decision-making.},

The wear model incorporates material properties, contact mechanics, and operational parameters, employing advanced finite element method to simulate real-world conditions accurately. Key variables such as material hardness and contact pressure are examined to determine their influence on wear depth. The simulation results indicate that wear is significantly affected by the surface hardness of the interacting materials. The liner experiences more wear than the piston ring due to its lower hardness and higher wear coefficient. The developed model is validated against Hertz contact pressures, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. In other words, the FEM results for contact pressure closely matched the predictions from the Hertz analytical solution. This study introduces integrating OpenFOAM simulation outputs as input for ANSYS APDL, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate wear analysis. Additionally, the wear simulation is conducted on a real large two-stroke engine, enhancing the practical relevance of the findings.

Findings show that when seismic waves contain sufficient low-frequency content, wave passage effect occurs in wave-facing outer corner columns, whereas inner corner columns do not. The last-arriving outer corner columns, however, displayed no consistent pattern. With the rise of the L/B ratio (when L/B = 3), the peak shear force and bending moment of the wave-facing outer corner columns go up by 13.8% and 7.1%, respectively. The last-arriving outer corner columns encounter up to an 11.1% increases in peak shear force and 10% in peak bending moment. When the seismic waves lack sufficient low-frequency content, the corner columns of the L-shaped frame structure are less likely to experience wave passage effect.},

  abstract = {In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative tool in education, particularly in language acquisition. Traditional language learning methods often struggle to provide immersive, interactive, and engaging experiences that foster real-world communication skills. VR environments are increasingly transforming English language acquisition by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences that enhance communication skills development. This paper explores the impact of immersive VR technologies on English language acquisition, focusing on communication skills development through dynamic and interactive learning experiences. A novel Dynamic Monarch Butterfly Optimized Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (DMBO-BiGRU) model is presented to analyze learner interactions within VR environments, assessing communication patterns, language complexity, and learning progression. The dataset, collected from student interactions in VR settings, was preprocessed using noise filtering and normalization to ensure data quality. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is employed to extract key features, such as fluency, vocabulary usage, and contextual appropriateness. The DMBO-BiGRU model leverages adaptive learning strategies to provide tailored feedback and optimizes language acquisition based on learners’ communication skills. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated through experimental results, which indicate good accuracy and positive VR learning scores. The results underscore how immersive, customized, and interactive experiences provided by VR-integrated deep learning models hold the potential to transform language acquisition, showing accuracy of 97.2%, VR score of 97.52%, training gain of 98.49%, detection score of 92.6%, and a retention rate of 96% at iteration 13.

This study integrates three pre-trained models—VGGFace for facial recognition, DeepSpeech for voice analysis, and BERT for text processing—to develop a multimodal emotion recognition system that enhances intelligent and personalized elderly care. A high-quality emotion dataset is first constructed through comprehensive data collection and preprocessing. Transfer learning is then applied to optimize the three models, achieving precise facial, voice, and text-based emotion recognition. By incorporating feature-level and decision-level fusion strategies, the system improves recognition accuracy and robustness. A dynamic feedback mechanism further refines care strategies, ensuring a more adaptive and humanized elderly care experience. Comparative experiments show that the proposed system significantly outperforms existing models in emotion recognition accuracy (88.63%) and recall (85.93%), with an average response time of just 3.22 seconds. Moreover, after system implementation, the mental health scores of elderly participants improved, decreasing from 6.53 to 4.73 points. User feedback confirms the system’s effectiveness, with an average satisfaction rating of 4.33 across multiple care service dimensions.

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based style transfer techniques have been employed to modify traditional woodcut paper horse art images. This art form struggles to maintain its cultural character while adapting to modern digital media. Style transfer, as a DL technique, allows for the combination of the innovative style of one image with the content of another, enabling the digital recreation of conventional aesthetics. Data collection involved the compilation of a dataset consisting of high-resolution images of traditional woodcut paper horse art. The dataset was preprocessed through normalization of image sizes, application of data augmentation techniques to enhance diversity and mitigate overfitting, and filtering of images to isolate specific features of paper horse art, including line work, shading, and texture. This research proposed the Intelligent Pied Kingfisher - Refined Convolutional Neural Network (IPK-RCNN) model, which is trained on both traditional woodcut images and modern digital art, aiming to create a hybrid style that respects traditional aesthetics while integrating contemporary stylistic elements. The style transfer process employs a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) that incorporates IPK optimization for the enhancement of convolutional layer weight parameters, thereby improving both efficiency and accuracy. The IPK-RCNN method effectively preserves the intricate textures and details of woodcut art while incorporating modern stylistic variations. The model achieves high-quality outputs, attaining a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 35.12 dB, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.90, and an efficient execution time of 31.17 ms.

  abstract = {Emotion analysis in literary texts is a complex task due to the intricate nature of language, rich contextual dependencies, and subtle emotional manifestations present in narratives, dialogues, and poetic structures. Traditional lexicon-based models frequently fail to capture the complexity of emotions in literature, leading to incorrect classifications. This study examines the ability of BERT to enhance emotion analysis for literary texts. An innovative Dynamic Honey Badger-tuned BERT (DHB-BERT) model is applied to effectively detect emotional changes in literary texts. Training and emotion analysis are ensured through a diverse dataset of Chinese literary works, with accurate samples to evaluate the model. Lemmatization and stemming serve as preprocessing techniques that reduce words to their most basic forms to preserve continuity. Then, feature extraction is performed using Word2Vec, which maintains relevant linkages and captures emotional fluctuations. Based on the sentiment analysis, texts are classified as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. The Dynamic Honey Badger algorithm is employed for feature selection and adaptation of the dataset for improved emotion classification. The BERT model is then utilized to capture meaningful emotional variations across various literary forms. This simulation is executed using a Python platform. To evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation, various performance metrics are employed, including precision (94.76%), recall (95%), accuracy (95%), and F1-score (94.13%). Experimental results indicate that the DHB-BERT model significantly outperforms traditional algorithms, particularly in handling rhetorical language, irony, and nuanced emotional manifestations.

  abstract = {Background
            Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Awareness and the evidence supporting the merits of palliative care (PC) approaches to people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are increasing.
          
          
            Objective
            This review aimed to address four key questions related to PC for PwPs and their caregivers: i) What are the indicators for timely access to PC? ii) When should PC be introduced? iii) What are the current care models for providing PC? iv) What are the barriers and facilitators at the organizational level?
          
          
            Methods
            A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (2006–2024). Six reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts, and thematic synthesis was applied to develop analytical themes. Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines.
          
          
            Results
            Out of 894 studies, 70 were included. PwPs were infrequently referred to PC services, and while several referral criteria were identified, no consensus emerged. Barriers to accessing PC included insufficient information, inadequate education, difficulties determining referral timing, limited home-based care options, inconsistent provider support, and disparities linked to socioeconomic and cultural factors. Facilitators included improved care coordination and education for PwPs, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Effective PC models were identified, including home-based, hospital-based, and community-based approaches, which improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Establishing consensus on referral timing and criteria is essential for integrating PC into Parkinson's disease care. Overcoming barriers requires enhanced education, better care coordination, and targeted interventions to address disparities, ensuring comprehensive, patient-centred care for PwPs and their caregivers.},

  abstract = {In alpine and canyon areas, the problems of reservoir bank deformation and landslides are prominent. How to quickly and efficiently monitor deformation, timely identify geological disasters, and carry out surveys and treatments has become a crucial issue to be resolved urgently. Traditional survey methods are restricted by factors such as steep terrain and inconvenient transportation, resulting in low efficiency. In recent years, remote sensing technology has developed rapidly in the field of geological disaster monitoring, thanks to its high-precision deformation monitoring capabilities. This study is based on the Baihetan Hydropower Station during the water storage stage. The InSAR deformation monitoring technology is used to conduct large-scale disaster risk screening of the reservoir bank slopes. Firstly, the study analyzes the characteristics of UAV laser point clouds and images to construct a point cloud sequence. Subsequently, an improved iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that integrates the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and cylindrical neighborhood search is applied to improve the accuracy of slope deformation extraction. Finally, with the help of recognition algorithms and practical engineering experience, the surface deformation is analyzed based on the measured terrain data. The research shows that the surface deformation recognition technology based on UAV inspection and InSAR data has significant advantages in the monitoring of geological disasters in reservoirs in alpine and canyon areas.

This research proposes a novel approach to improve MT accuracy for Xhosa-to-English translation using Adaptive Gradient Boosted Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (AdaGrad-BBERT). This method combines the powerful capabilities of BERT with adaptive gradient boosting, enhancing contextual understanding and overall translation accuracy. The system integrates a series of preprocessing steps to optimize model performance. Initially, the dataset undergoes text cleaning, including the removal of noise, normalization of punctuation, and correction of spelling inconsistencies. Tokenization uses BERT’s word-piece model, effectively handling rare and out-of-vocabulary words. Part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing are applied to capture syntactic relationships specific to Xhosa, which has distinct grammatical structures compared to English. Pre-trained BERT embeddings are employed to generate rich, context-sensitive representations of Xhosa words, ensuring more accurate translations. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism is fine-tuned using the AdaGrad-BBERT optimization technique. Translation quality is evaluated using the BLEU score, and model performance is assessed over multiple training epochs. Simulations are conducted using the TensorFlow framework to train and evaluate the model on the Xhosa-English dataset, with results demonstrating significant improvements in translation accuracy, the BLUE score increased 0.896. The proposed system highlights the potential of AdaGrad-BBERT in bridging the gap in MT for underrepresented languages, offering a scalable solution for enhancing MT.

            Several stakeholders are formally recognised when designing undergraduate medical curricula, but past studies have failed to identify them with sufficient breadth, to explore their understanding of the system, or examine their views on curriculum composition. This qualitative study drew on elements of systems thinking to better understand the stakeholders in undergraduate medical education and their role and priorities in curriculum composition.
          
          
            Methods
            This study employed an exploratory qualitative methodology. Participants were initially identified from the General Medical Council's list of stakeholders and were recruited using a combination of convenience, judgmental and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semistructured interviewing. Interviews were descriptively coded and then thematically analysed.
          
          
            Results
            In total, 18 participants were interviewed about their perspectives on stakeholders, the purpose of the education, along with their ideal weightings for curriculum subjects. The findings suggested that the breadth of stakeholders exceeded the modest list provided by the General Medical Council. The purposes of the education were themed into: (1) safe patient care, (2) social benefit, (3) service provision, (4) student benefit and (5) provider benefit. Safe patient care emerged as a universally shared purpose, although views on the customer varied between participants. Curricula priorities were more diverse, with competing interests favouring different subjects for emphasis in the curriculum, with views on the value of scientific-learning particularly divided.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Undergraduate medical education likely concerns a broader range of stakeholders than are often engaged. Several stakeholders are formally recognised when designing undergraduate medical curricula but past studies have failed to identify them with sufficient breadth, to explore their understanding of the system, or to examine their views on curriculum composition. This research raised questions about engagement of vital stakeholders and how power is distributed in the system, along with the need to develop roles into the future when renewing curricula.},

  abstract = {The Flying Bluebottle Illusion is a compelling example of how the perceived trajectory of moving objects can be greatly influenced by other motion sources in the visual scene. In this article, we present a series of simplified variants of the Flying Bluebottle Illusion in which the true motion of a target is a circular orbit around a central point. However, when a similar but offset orbiting motion trajectory is added to a set of surrounding inducers, the perceived trajectory of the target is drastically altered in both extent and direction. In other words, the perceived orbiting motion of the target is “pulled” and distorted by the orbiting motion of the inducers. For simplicity's sake, we refer to the illusory effect revealed by these dueling orbits as the Dueling Orbit Illusion. These simplified variants lend themselves to empirical study with resultant effects that can be readily modeled. Here, we present a series of case examples for how the parameters of the stimuli may be varied to yield predictable effects, describe a straightforward computational model for quantifying the magnitude of the contextual influence, and discuss how the model may be leveraged to gain insight into the phenomenon of induced motion across a range of within and between observer domains.},

            Methods
            
              Jatropha podagrica
              leaves, stems, and roots were extracted using 70% ethanol. The extract was then fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Antibacterial assays, including agar well diffusion and MIC - MBC determination, were carried out. Bioactive compounds were docked with bacterial target proteins using AutoDock Vina. Binding interactions were analyzed. SwissADME, ProTox-3.0, and STopTox were used to assess the drug-likeness and toxicity of selected compounds. Data were expressed as mean ± SD using Microsoft Excel 2010.

  abstract = {Flatfoot is a very common condition that alters gait mechanics and is usually accompanied by pain. In this current study, two types of custom-made insoles using polyethylene and silicon, respectively, were designed to help alleviate this condition. Such insoles are tested for their functionality using advanced 3D printing and finite element analysis. Tests were conducted at body weights of 60, 80, 100, and 120 kg. Results indicated that silicone insoles outperformed the others by effecting a better redistribution of pressure with higher magnitudes of strain and stress. Specifically, silicon had strain values between 1.44 × 10

            and 2.88 × 10

Further validation through kinematic analysis proved that silicon insoles enhance the symmetry of walk and disperses the concentration of pressures of the feet, therefore providing more comfort and support during locomotion. These results suggest that silicon insoles offer significant benefits for managing flatfoot, paving the way for future innovations in personalized orthopedic footwear.},

  abstract = {Creative writing instruction plays a crucial role in developing students’ linguistic and cognitive abilities. However, challenges such as lack of engagement, difficulty in idea generation, and limited stylistic diversity hinder students from fully expressing their thoughts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution to enhance writing quality and creativity. This study aims to develop an AI-assisted creative writing framework by integrating GPT-4 with Innovative Locust Swarm Optimization (ILSO) to generate more engaging, coherent, and stylistically rich text tailored to students’ writing levels. A dataset of student-written essays, novels, and poetry was collected for training. Pre-processing techniques, including text normalization and tokenization, were applied to refine the input text. Feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec embedding to enhance semantic understanding. GPT-4 generates adaptive text suggestions, while ILSO optimizes model hyperparameters to refine text coherence, creativity, and narrative flow. The optimized model adapts to individual writing styles, offering dynamic suggestions that encourage creativity while maintaining fluency. The ILSO algorithm fine-tunes the generation process by enhancing text structuring and thematic consistency. The proposed method was implemented using Python 3.10.1. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized GPT model significantly improves coherence scores, stylistic variation, thematic consistency, writing proficiency, and engagement rates. However, concerns regarding AI dependency and originality necessitate a balanced integration of AI-assisted and traditional writing pedagogy. This study provides a foundation for future adaptive AI-driven creative writing instruction, with potential extensions including real-time feedback systems and self-learning mechanisms for personalized writing enhancement.},

A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 346 fifth-grade students from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group utilized gamified tools, such as ClassDojo and Wordwall, while the control group employed traditional teaching methods. Data collection included achievement tests, observational measures, and assessments of computational thinking. The author used Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) with the “qgraph” package in R to estimate the network structures. Initial visual programming skills showed no significant differences between groups. However, post-test results revealed substantial improvements in both visual programming and computational thinking for the experimental group. The gamified learning environment effectively enhanced these skills through increased motivation and active engagement. These findings support the use of gamification in primary education to enhance critical 21st-century skills. However, the study’s geographic and grade-level specificity limits generalizability, and long-term skill retention was not assessed. Future research should expand to diverse demographics, incorporate longitudinal designs, and explore integration with emerging technologies (e.g., adaptive learning platforms).},

However, several critical limitations affect the deployment of these technologies, including privacy concerns and the need for advanced predictions about student behavior alongside adaptations to standard educational frameworks. This investigation examines the role of LA in ELT, focusing on how data-driven strategies powered by artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning (DL), can enhance student engagement and academic success. The dataset, sourced from a publicly available Kaggle repository, comprises anonymized real-world student interaction metrics, including demographics, engagement patterns, interactions with the learning system, and academic performance. To efficiently preprocess the dataset, numerical features are normalized using Z-score normalization, and features are extracted using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which assigns weights to each term based on its frequency in a document and rarity across the dataset. DL models, including the weighted white shark optimized deep residual network (WWSO-DResNet), were employed to examine student engagement patterns, predict learning outcomes, and provide personalized learning paths. The findings indicate that students who received personalized learning interventions based on WWSO-DResNet insights performed significantly better in terms of engagement and academic achievement. The performance of the proposed WWSO-DResNet approach was evaluated using metrics such as MAE (0.09), RMSE (0.21), MSE (0.18), and MAPE (0.25). The WWSO-DResNet method proved effective in identifying at-risk students early, enabling preventive interventions. In conclusion, AI-powered LA holds promise for transforming ELT by fostering personalized learning experiences.},

This research focuses on reliable AI-powered accounting chatbots capable of handling complex financial tasks while enhancing customer communication and user satisfaction. The goal of this study is to establish AI-based chatbots in accounting services to improve financial management assistance and customer communication. This paper presents a novel Raven Roosting-tuned Adaptive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (RR-ABiLSTM) model designed to classify financial queries and enhance contextual understanding in conversations to improve customer communications. The dataset encompasses both structured and unstructured data from accounting conversations, constituting a domain-specific corpus focusing on common accounting tasks. Data preprocessing included text cleaning and tokenization applied to the acquired data. Subsequently, feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec. The RR algorithm was utilized to optimize hyperparameters and feature selection, while BiLSTM ensures a deep understanding of contextual relationships in conversations, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency in processing financial queries. Furthermore, a dynamic training mechanism was integrated, allowing the chatbot to continually adapt to increasing consumer demands without downtime. The proposed method was implemented using Python software, and its performance was compared with traditional algorithms. The overall metrics—F1-score (87.75%), precision (89.25%), recall (86.24%), and accuracy (90%)—illustrate that the suggested model significantly improves customer engagement, reduces the workload of accountants, and enhances the overall efficiency of accounting services by providing reliable financial support.},

  abstract = {Introduction:
            Digital health innovations are increasingly being designed to support chronic disease management. Digital health innovations may be particularly valuable for supporting health coaching interventions for type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission. To design more effective digitally enabled health coaching for T2D remission, design methods that utilize co-design, design thinking, and service blueprinting may be advantageous.
          
          
            Methods:
            A one-day collaborative design thinking workshop in Toronto, Canada involved health coaches from pan-Canadian T2D remission research sites. Health coaches reflected on their experiences and identified digital innovation opportunities. Workshop activities included empathizing with each other, defining clear opportunities, and ideating solutions. Data were collected through audio recordings, field notes, and activity outputs, and then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Researchers synthesized the data into a service blueprint, which outlined specific needs for delivering future digitally enabled T2D remission programming.
          
          
            Results:
            Health coaches emphasized the importance of personalized goal setting, deep relationship building, and responsive behavioral recommendations in effective T2D remission coaching. Coaches envisioned digital tools as fundamental for improving information accessibility, streamlining workflows, and delivering tailored support throughout the T2D remission journey. The developed service blueprint pinpointed key opportunities where digital technology could enhance the coaching process over time, offering actionable solutions to address patient, coach, provider, and system needs.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            This study demonstrates the transformative potential of using co-design, design thinking, and service blueprinting to create more meaningful digital health self-management interventions. Future research should validate the developed service blueprint in real-world settings and explore the impact of digitally enabled health coaching on long-term T2D remission outcomes.},

  abstract = {Mongolian folk painting images have long served as a symbol of the richness of their cultural legacy. These images represent a profound cultural demonstration of the nomadic lifestyle and spiritual beliefs of the Mongolian people. This study presents a predictive framework that uses CNN-based VGG16 model as an image recognition technology to identify Mongolian folk art. The proposed framework consists of multiple parts, such as image source engines for automated data collecting, image classes for Mongolian and Indian traditional paintings, dataset creation, and manual image visualization to guarantee the quality of the datasets. Stability of the dataset is improved by preprocessing methods like pixel value normalization and overfitting minimization. With its deep convolutional neural network architecture, the CNN-based VGG16 model is used for image recognition and shows skill in recognizing intricate visual patterns. The proposed framework is distinguished by a methodical algorithmic flow that includes dataset creation, model training, iterative refinement, and data retrieval. Test accuracy (77.97%) and test loss (0.6828) demonstrate how well the model recognizes Mongolian folk paintings. Extensive results that include feature extraction, ROC and PR curves, and confusion matrix analysis highlight how well the framework achieves a balanced precision-recall trade-off. This study contributes a useful methodology to the growing field of cultural image recognition, highlighting the integration of traditional art with advanced technology.},

  abstract = {The study addresses limitations of the 4-Component Thinking Styles Questionnaire (4-CTSQ) measuring actively open-minded thinking (AOT), close-minded thinking (CMT), preference for effortful thinking (PET), and preference for intuitive thinking (PIT). The aim was to validate the 4-CTSQ in a non-U.S./Canadian population, to explore the nomological networks of thinking styles, and to test whether the 4-CTSQ predicts unfounded beliefs over and beyond analytic thinking. The secondary aim was to address the issue of acquiescence linked with the one-directional wording of the items and to develop a balanced version of the 4-CTSQ (4-CTSQ-B). In two studies (

Conceptual and psychometric issues with AOT and CMT were identified and possible solutions were discussed.

A comprehensive power transmission model, alongside an equivalent circuit model for data communication, is developed to capture the electromagnetic coupling and transmission dynamics within the multi-relay environment. The characteristics of both power and data channels are analytically examined, and the validity of the proposed methodology is substantiated through simulation studies.

However, limited by the problems of insufficient data and class imbalance in the monitoring of tunnel defects, the model may face the prediction bias during the training process.

The Xception model extracts both fine-grained details and global semantic information, while PCA selects the most discriminative principal components to reduce redundant features, enhancing classification accuracy and efficiency. Experiments conducted on Eastern and Western painting datasets with 10-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including EfficientNet, RegNet, and ConvNeXT. Notably, it achieves an average classification accuracy of 0.973 in Western painting classification. Moreover, the integration of PCA significantly reduces computation time, with classification speeds of 105 ms for Eastern paintings and 100 ms for Western paintings, surpassing benchmark models. This study presents an efficient and precise solution for automated art style classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction.

  abstract = {The creativity of artistic works encompasses multifaceted elements such as color, shape, and texture, characterized by their complexity and subtlety. Current evaluation methods are predominantly subjective, lacking the ability to objectively and comprehensively capture and quantify these dynamic attributes. To address this limitation, this study proposes an innovative approach for evaluating artistic creativity by integrating an artificial immune algorithm (AIA). Initially, features related to color, shape, and texture are extracted from the artworks, and these feature vectors are input into the AIA as antigens. Subsequently, by defining antigen-antibody matching rules, the features of the artworks are compared with creative reference antibodies generated by the algorithm to derive creativity evaluation results. Finally, leveraging a dynamic adjustment mechanism for bidirectional crossover mutation probabilities, the diversity of the antibody population is optimized through a clonal selection strategy, enhancing the model’s adaptability to diverse artistic styles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved AIA achieves significant enhancements in evaluation metrics, with average Precision and Recall values increasing by 8.45% and 11.21%, respectively, compared to the baseline AIA. This study concludes that the AIA-integrated creativity evaluation method effectively improves the objectivity and accuracy of artistic assessments, offering a novel perspective for the intelligent evaluation of artworks.},

First, a diverse set of advertisement samples is collected, and image augmentation techniques are applied to expand the dataset. The YOLOv4 model is then trained using the CSPDarknet53 (Cross-Stage Partial Darknet53) network for feature extraction, integrating multi-scale prediction to improve detection accuracy. The trained model is subsequently utilized to identify and analyze visual elements within advertisements, assessing their spatial distribution and layout characteristics. Based on these insights, an automated optimization framework is developed to refine design elements such as color, size, and layout proportions, with the results visualized for comparative analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a detection precision of 98.1% and a recall rate of 96.8% for product elements. The optimized print advertisements exhibit a focus concentration of 0.84 and an element distribution density of 0.87, significantly enhancing design clarity and effectiveness.

  abstract = {Efficiently managing sports schedules in collegiate environments is a challenging and crucial task. With multiple teams, events, facilities, and diverse stakeholder needs, traditional scheduling methods often fail to meet the dynamic and complex requirements of modern sports programs. Complex scheduling algorithms offer a promising solution by optimizing the allocation of resources, time slots, and facilities while minimizing conflicts and maximizing participation. The research analyzes the impact of complex scheduling algorithms on injury rates and athletic performance in a collegiate sports environment, with a particular focus on ACL injuries in basketball players. The research gathers the history, performance, and demographic data from athletes. The data was preprocessed using cleansing and normalizing the data, and handling missing values. The research employs an ICO-MLPN to predict injury risk and improve athletic performance in collegiate sports environments. The research explores the application of the DLB scheduling algorithm to create tailored schedules that account for individual requirements, training intensity, and recovery periods to reduce the risk of ACL. The findings suggest that the complex scheduling algorithms improve athletic performance and also significantly reduce the incidence of ACL injuries, offering an ICO-MLPN framework for collegiate basketball programs to improve performance with a recall of 95.33%, accuracy of 98.70%, precision of 98.2%, and F1-score of 96.20%.

Recovery time decreased from 2.5 days to 2 days, and minimum severity injuries increased from 50% to 65%.

  abstract = {In traditional environmental art design, it is often challenging to comprehensively account for a multitude of complex factors, and the optimization process tends to be computationally intensive and intricate. Key aspects such as illumination, shadow, and sightlines between landscape elements are frequently overlooked, leading to incoherent layout schemes in practical applications. This study addresses these limitations by employing genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize the layout of landscape elements, thereby automating the generation of optimal layout schemes. Initially, an objective function is established to evaluate layout schemes by holistically considering landscape aesthetics, functionality, ecological benefits, and feasibility, with each factor’s contribution quantified. The layout scheme is encoded into real-valued representations, where each individual denotes the location, size, and other attributes of landscape elements. An initial population is generated to ensure diversity and adherence to basic constraints. Each generation of individuals is assessed using a fitness function that integrates multiple sub-goals, evaluating the merits of each layout scheme through weighted summation. The tournament selection method is employed to choose individuals with higher fitness in each generation for crossover and mutation operations, thereby generating new layout schemes. Through iterative optimization over multiple generations, the genetic algorithm refines the layout scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the overall space utilization rate exceeds 0.7, and the weighted scores of the landscape layout schemes range between 8.075 and 8.59. This approach offers a novel solution for environmental art design, significantly enhancing the coherence and practicality of layout schemes.},

  abstract = {Background:
            Sagittal-plane slope-reducing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) can reduce the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in knees with a high posterior tibial slope. The biomechanical effect of slope-reducing HTO on tibiofemoral kinematics and force carried by the ACL remains less well understood.
          
          
            Hypothesis:
            Decreased tibial slope will be associated with decreased ACL force, coupled internal tibial rotation (ITR), and anterior tibial translation (ATT) under both compressive and combined compressive and valgus loads.
          
          
            Study Design:
            Descriptive laboratory study.
          
          
            Methods:
            Computational models of 10 cadaveric knees were created using magnetic resonance imaging– and computed tomography–based 3-dimensional renderings of the bones, articular cartilage, and menisci. Virtual slope-reducing HTO was performed on each tibial geometry in 1° increments, creating tibial slopes spanning −5° to 15°. All knees were flexed to 15°, and loads consisting of (1) axial compression (100 N) and (2) combined axial compression (100 N) and valgus torque (8 N·m) were then applied to each knee at each tibial slope. The outcome measures were ACL force, coupled ITR, and ATT. Relationships between tibial slope and each outcome measure were assessed via linear regression (α = .05), and the effects of 10° slope-reducing HTO, from 15° to 5°, on each outcome measure were reported.
          
          
            Results:
            
              A 10° slope-reducing HTO decreased ACL force by 53% under compression (1.7 N of ACL force per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001) and 47% under combined compression and valgus (4.7 N of ACL force per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001). Regarding kinematics, a 10° slope-reducing HTO decreased coupled ITR by 64% under combined compression and valgus (0.99° of coupled ITR per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P

            Conclusion:

  abstract = {In construction projects, reliably forecasting the compressive strength of concrete samples plays a critical role. To enhance the prediction accuracy, this research introduces a prediction model for concrete compressive strength utilizing Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs). Based on two datasets with different scales, containing 1030 and 324 groups of concrete samples, respectively, the KANs model was used for modeling, and the optimal hyperparameters of the KANs model were identified using grid search. The results show that, on the two datasets, the KANs model achieved a root mean square error of 5.09 MPa and 0.97 MPa, and the goodness of fit reached 0.90 and 0.99, respectively, outperforming the comparison methods multi-layer perceptron’s neural networks and support vector machine. Under simulated measurement noise conditions (Gaussian perturbations with 10% feature-level variance), the KANs model demonstrated robust performance preservation, exhibiting &lt;5% relative degradation in prediction accuracy. This resilience to instrumentation-level uncertainties substantiates the model’s operational reliability in practical concrete testing environments. To assess the generalization ability of the KANs model, the model was trained with a small proportion of samples from dataset 2 based on dataset 1. The results indicate that when the sample proportion was increased to 30%, the KANs model achieved an RMSE and R

  abstract = {This article explores the relationship between race, technology, music, and geographical thought through the vehicle of jazz musician Sun Ra’s piece ‘Space Is the Place’ considered in formal, historical, and critical context. Specifically, the author engages with Katherine McKittrick’s concept of transparent space to argue that ‘Space Is the Place’, in a tradition reaching from Ra’s avant-garde popular music back through a rich tradition of Black American musical practice, deploys time signature in a way that upsets traditional concepts of grounds or grounding embedded at the foundation of Western thought. Taking seriously Ra’s conviction that his music literally, and not merely figuratively, transports listeners to a new planet, this article speculatively suggests that the form of thought generated by the music’s disruption of grounds/grounding is uniquely suitable for addressing the radical social, economic, and political shifts currently occurring in humanity’s rapidly intensifying flight from the grounds of the Earth. The compression of these vast social forces into the sensuous experience of ‘Space Is the Place’ thus transports the listener by altering fundamental processes of spatiotemporal relationality that echo into conscious thought. This article demonstrates the interconnectedness of musical expression with geographical imaginaries and suggests a new kind of thinking with which to approach geographical analyses beyond the geocentric, capable of answering the demands of the cosmos.},

Under the day-ahead invitation demand response mechanism, an aggregation method for industrial conveying loads and an active potential mining framework for load aggregators participating in demand response are proposed. The demand response potential mining of the conveying load aggregators is formulated as optimization problems. Through the constructions of publishment functions attaching to demand response period, a potential mining model for day-ahead invitation demand response and an integrated potential mining model capable to response to day-ahead invitation demand and time-of-use tariff simultaneously are built, respectively. A cement clinker conveying system is taken as the study case to verify the demand response active potential mining models under multi-operating conditions. The results show that the proposed active potential mining models can actively participate in day-ahead invitation demand response and obtain the maximum potential, meanwhile, satisfy all the production requirements and safety constraints.

  abstract = {Existing LSTM-based power quality (PQ) prediction models primarily rely on historical information, which limits their ability to fully capture contextual dependencies. Furthermore, these models process inputs sequentially without accounting for the varying importance of different time steps, leading to significant prediction inaccuracies. To address these limitations, this study proposes an enhanced PQ prediction model that integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism. The BiLSTM module is introduced to model both forward and backward temporal dependencies, enabling a more comprehensive capture of long-term patterns in time series data. The SA mechanism dynamically adjusts the importance of different time steps through weighted summation, enhancing the model’s ability to focus on critical features and improving its capacity to model nonlinear relationships. The weighted features from the SA layer are then mapped to a fully connected layer to generate the final prediction outputs. Experiments were conducted using power quality data from Nanchang as the primary dataset, with additional datasets from Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, and Beijing used for generalization testing. The results demonstrate that the BiLSTM-SA model outperforms traditional LSTM models across all PQ metrics, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.09 for voltage deviation, a 0.05 improvement over single-layer LSTM. Notably, the model maintains robust performance in complex power supply scenarios, with a generalized MAE of only 0.2 in Beijing. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining BiLSTM with the SA mechanism in reducing prediction errors and ensuring the stability of power supply quality, offering a significant advancement in PQ prediction methodologies.},

We formulate crime count prediction as a spatiotemporal sequence challenge, where both input data and prediction targets are spatiotemporal sequences. In order to improve the accuracy of crime forecasting, we introduce a new model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We conducted a comparative analysis to access the effects of various data sequences, including raw and binned data, on the prediction errors of four deep learning forecasting models. Directly inputting raw crime data into the forecasting model causes high prediction errors, making the model unsuitable for real-world use. The findings indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves optimal performance when crime data is categorized into 10 or 5 groups. Data binning can enhance forecasting model performance, but poorly defined intervals may reduce map granularity. Compared to dividing into five bins, binning into 10 intervals strikes an optimal balance, preserving data characteristics and surpassing raw data in predictive modeling efficacy.},

This study proposes an innovative methodological framework that synergistically integrates the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm with advanced topic modeling techniques, thereby offering transformative potential for the analysis and governance of online public discourse. The methodology involves a sophisticated multi-stage analytical process: First, textual data undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being transformed into a term frequency matrix using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, establishing a robust quantitative foundation for subsequent analysis. The LDA algorithm is then systematically applied to extract latent thematic structures from the dataset, while an original hierarchical optimization strategy substantially enhances the model’s dynamic topic identification and tracking capabilities. Furthermore, the integration of a sentiment lexicon with the extracted topics enables precise opinion classification, permitting real-time monitoring of topic evolution through quantitative heat fluctuation metrics. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to conventional LDA, achieving a 12.7% reduction in the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for tracking topic heat dynamics. This methodological breakthrough not only advances the theoretical foundations of public opinion analysis but also provides a scientifically rigorous, dynamic monitoring framework with significant practical implications for evidence-based governance and policy formulation in the digital era.},

This architecture consists of a foundation layer, data layer, service layer, functional application layer, and user interaction layer. The functional modules of the platform also adopt microservice architecture design. In response to the shortcomings of model checking, an IFC component of the model checking module was designed based on an optimized multi view convolutional neural network algorithm to correct errors in the lowest level category information data.

Utilizing Dozee, a cutting-edge contactless monitoring system, we sought to identify optimal sensor placements. Data was collated from 18 healthy participants and 7 with vascular conditions, with sensors arrayed across the upper and lower body. Post rigorous signal filtering and statistical analyses, the thorax and lumbar spine sensors emerged as the most accurate for the upper and lower body, respectively. However, regions like the cerebral and legs faced compromised signals due to external interferences such as body movements. The study underscores BCG’s potential as a promising, non-invasive, and cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostics.

  abstract = {Deep excavation engineering plays a crucial role in modern urban construction, and its safety has garnered significant attention, especially in seismically active regions. The complex structure and scale of deep excavations make the study of their dynamic response and stability under seismic loading particularly important. However, current research on deep excavation engineering under seismic effects has certain limitations, primarily in the insufficient consideration of the interaction between excavation structures and the surrounding soil, as well as the inaccuracy of seismic load simulations. These limitations restrict the effectiveness and accuracy of existing design theories. This study aims to explore the dynamic response and stability issues of deep excavation engineering under seismic loading in depth. The research focuses on two main aspects: first, investigating the dynamic response characteristics of deep excavations under different seismic conditions; and second, evaluating the overall stability of deep excavations under seismic loading using stability analysis models. Through a systematic study, this research aims to provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the seismic design of deep excavation engineering, ultimately enhancing safety in engineering practice.},

  abstract = {Sensory differences are well documented in autistic individuals. However, early sensory experiences have not been fully explored, particularly from the perspective of autistic people. We sought to understand early sensory experiences in autism from the perspective of autistic adults (some of whom also had autistic children) and caregivers of autistic children (some of whom also had a personal autism diagnosis). Using a qualitative descriptive design, aligned with a constructivist paradigm, focus groups were conducted with 3 autistic adults and 12 caregivers of autistic children. Data were analysed with reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were generated accounting for early sensory experiences in autism: (1) Acknowledging the uniqueness of sensory preferences, (2) Negative impacts of different sensory experiences, (3) Feeling different and the pursuit of belonging, (4) Controlling sensory experiences to support daily function, and finally (5) Overcoming the challenges of the sensory world. The findings highlight the specific sensory needs of autistic children in early childhood and the adaptability of caregivers. This information can help young autistic people and caregivers advocate the importance of recognising the uniqueness of each autistic child’s sensory preferences when seeking support.
          
            Lay Abstract
            Sensory behaviours in early childhood can impact how autistic children experience and engage in the world. There is a lot of research about sensory differences in autistic children; however, there is very little known about experiences in early childhood. We asked 3 autistic adults and 12 caregivers of autistic children about their/their child’s experiences of sensory behaviours in early childhood. In our sample, autistic adults and caregivers of autistic children shared similar experiences about the challenges they/their children face related to sensory experiences in early childhood and how they overcame these. The findings can influence how researchers and service providers view sensory preferences in early childhood by understanding that everyone’s preferences are unique, and the importance of advocating for what works for each autistic person.},

  abstract = {Since digital media have changed the way information is disseminated and even social interaction behavior, the issue of affective value throughout the history of human development has created a divide between constructivist and universalist research. In this process, the focus of affective research has begun to shift towards redefining its connotations and uncovering the productive factors through which its value is expressed. To visually present the research frontiers and hotspots, and classify and analyze the data, various knowledge graphs were drawn using CiteSpace visualization analysis tool. Web of Science was selected as the data source, and K-means algorithm was used for clustering analysis to identify different topics and hotspots in the research field. This study found that affective value in the age of digital media shows a triple bias of social interaction, media memory and neurocognition. When individual affect spread through social media platforms like TikTok, it can escalate quickly, leading to a cascade of significant social events. This has spurred important research avenues into affective value such as organizational dynamics, media functions, and neuroscience. Thus, this paper argues that the tension between affective value and the application of affective value in the governance of digital media space is the main direction to solve the affective conflict or affective cooperation in the current society. This study integrates theories such as evolution theory, social constructivism, and psychoanalysis, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of emotional values and also having important guiding significance for the design and operation of digital media platforms.},

  abstract = {To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of path planning in smart elderly care services, this paper proposes a hybrid path optimization model integrating Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Traditional approaches struggle with dynamic environmental adaptation and multi-objective optimization, often leading to suboptimal routing. To address this, the proposed model employs DQN to establish an autonomous decision-making framework, leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize path selection based on environmental variations and reward mechanisms. Meanwhile, PSO enhances the global search capability, adjusting particle positions and velocities to mitigate the risk of local optima and improve overall path efficiency. A multi-objective optimization framework is further introduced, incorporating weighted coefficients to balance competing objectives and ensure comprehensive optimization. Additionally, a dynamic environmental adaptation mechanism enables real-time data updates, allowing the system to swiftly respond to sudden environmental changes and continuously refine path selection. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior performance, achieving an average path planning time of 52 seconds and a service response time of 17 s. The approach maintains high path accuracy, with a minimal distance deviation of 1.35%, and delivers an optimized objective function value of 0.84. These findings highlight the model’s effectiveness in real-time adaptive path planning, offering a robust and intelligent solution for elderly care mobility and service optimization.},

To address this gap, this study proposes an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, termed OBLPSO, which integrates Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) and a perturbation mechanism. First, OBL generates a high-quality initial population to improve solution diversity, while a cosine curve adaptive strategy dynamically adjusts inertia weights to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Additionally, a perturbation mechanism expands the search range, preventing premature convergence. A multi-objective optimization model is established, incorporating task time, economic cost, and environmental impact (e.g., energy consumption and pollutant emissions) to maximize resource utilization and minimize ecological harm. Experimental results demonstrate that OBLPSO reduces task processing time by 29.7% and energy consumption by 16.1% compared to benchmark algorithms (e.g., ACO, GA, and standard PSO) under large-scale tasks (2000 tasks). The proposed method provides a robust solution for sustainable resource scheduling in an enterprise management environment with economic constraints.},

This study integrates the Transformer model, leveraging its self-attention mechanism and position encoding to incorporate global information at each time step. This approach enables the flexible modeling of long-range dependencies, resulting in more natural and harmonically coherent music sequences. First, serialized encoding is employed to transform musical events. A multi-scale attention mechanism is then introduced, applying different attention strategies at each layer to capture distinct musical elements across various time scales. Additionally, periodic position encoding is incorporated to enhance the recognition of recurrent musical patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art models such as MuseNet, MelodyRNN, and MusicTransformer, the proposed method reduces average perplexity by 5.4%, 11.7%, and 9.5% on one dataset and 5.9%, 12.1%, and 10.3% on another. These findings highlight the model’s superior capability in generating high-quality music with enhanced melodic consistency and diversity.

A dataset comprising employment data from 810 graduates across three higher vocational colleges in a specific region, combined with macroeconomic indicators, was constructed. Data preprocessing techniques, such as missing value filling and feature standardization, were employed to ensure data quality. Feature selection was performed using univariate linear regression to eliminate irrelevant variables and retain highly correlated features. The NBC-based model, augmented with semi-supervised classification to expand the training dataset, demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average error rate of 2.76% in predicting employment across five workplaces and a 95.68% accuracy in salary level prediction. The model efficiently processed 10,000 student records in 35.28 milliseconds.

Certain cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to unexpected proarrhythmic effects such as fatal Torsade de Pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia.

The model predicts that a high-risk drug taken at the most optimal time of day may actually be safer than a low-risk drug taken at the least optimal time of day. Based on these proof-of-concept results, we advocate for the incorporation of circadian clock modeling into the CiPA paradigm for assessing drug-induced TdP risk. Since cardiotoxicity is the leading cause of drug discontinuation, modeling cardiac-related chronopharmacology has significant potential to improve therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Bearing fault diagnosis is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of rotating machinery in industrial settings. Machine learning-based diagnostic models offer powerful solutions, but their effectiveness is challenged by substantial domain shifts caused by variations in operating conditions, such as changes in motor load. To address this challenge, a novel domain adaptation framework that combines physical domain knowledge with deep learning techniques is proposed. The framework employs envelope spectrum analysis to generate reliable pseudo-labels for unlabeled target domains. By incorporating local maximum mean discrepancy into the training process, the framework aligns feature distributions between source and target domains while preserving class-specific information. This method enhances the adaptability of diagnostic models to real-world industrial conditions, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and improving predictive reliability across different operating scenarios. Experimental results performed on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving superior classification accuracy under significant domain shifts. By improving fault detection under varying load conditions, this approach contributes to more efficient predictive maintenance, reducing unexpected failures and operational downtime in industrial machinery. This approach highlights the potential of combining physics-based insights with deep learning to enhance fault diagnosis in diverse and complex industrial scenarios.},

Through a case study of gender segregation in friendships, this study presents a workflow for developing a machine-learning-based gender conformity measure and applying it to guide the social network analysis of cultural matching. Results show that adolescents with similar gender conformity are more likely to form friendships, net of homophily based on categorical gender and other controls, and homophily by gender conformity mediates homophily by categorical gender.

Deciduous teeth from patients with LDS2 exhibited normal enamel thickness, normal or localized reduction in enamel mineral density, impaired enamel ultrastructure, and impaired biomechanical properties, with some changes likely associated with environmental and systemic effects. Mice with mutation in the

            gene exhibited no significant changes in the amount of enamel produced or degree of mineralization. However, they presented with unique disruption of enamel rod decussation (crisscross pattern), resulting in impaired biomechanical properties. This phenotype is caused by impaired coordinated movement of ameloblasts (enamel-producing cells) during matrix deposition. Molecular analyses revealed that mutation in
            Tgfbr2
            in ameloblasts does not significantly affect pSMAD2/3 levels in vivo and has a minimal effect on gene expression in the enamel organ when compared with the aorta, in which hundreds of genes were differentially expressed and consistent with aortic aneurysm. However, we identified changes in the distribution and activation of the metastasis suppressor NDRG1, Rac1/Cdc42, and Myosin II that appear consistent with the disruption of ameloblast coordinated movement, although the exact mechanism through which mutation in

The results suggest that online CT awareness raising could be successful, if based on effective active learning principles, including good self-regulation, autonomy, willingness to offer peer-feedback and curiosity.

  abstract = {The primary goal of sinonasal surgery is to improve a patient’s quality of life, which is generally achieved by enhancing drug delivery (eg, saline rinses, nasal steroids) and nasal airflow. Both drug delivery and nasal airflow are dependent on the anatomic structure of the sinonasal cavity and the relationship between this anatomy and airflow and drug delivery can be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD generally uses computed tomography scans and computational algorithms to predict airflow or drug delivery and can help us understand surgical outcomes and optimize drug delivery for patients. This study employs CFD to simulate nasal airflow dynamics and optimize drug delivery in the nasal cavity to highlight the utility of CFD for studying sinonasal disease. Utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software, we developed detailed models to analyze changes in airflow characteristics before and after functional endoscopic sinus surgery, focusing on pressure distribution, velocity profiles, streamline patterns, and heat transfer. This research examines the impact of varying levels of nasal airway obstruction on airflow and heat transfer. In addition, we explore the characteristics of nasal drug delivery by simulating diverse spray parameters, including particle size, spray angle, and velocity. Our comprehensive approach allows for the visualization of drug particle trajectories and deposition patterns, providing crucial insights for enhancing surgical outcomes and improving targeted drug administration. By integrating patient-specific nasal cavity models and considering factors such as airway outlet pressure, this study offers valuable data on pressure cross-sections, flow rate variations, and particle behavior within the nasal passages. The findings of this research can be useful for both surgical planning and the development of more effective nasal drug delivery methods, potentially leading to enhanced clinical outcomes in respiratory treatment.},

  abstract = {Background
            Convolutional neural network (CNN) based volumetry of MRI data can help differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) as causes of cognitive decline and dementia. However, existing CNN-based MRI volumetry tools lack a structured hierarchical representation of brain anatomy, which would allow for aggregating regional pathological information and automated computational inference.
          
          
            Objective
            Develop a computational ontology pipeline for quantifying hierarchical pathological abnormalities and visualize summary charts for brain atrophy findings, aiding differential diagnosis.
          
          
            Methods
            Using FastSurfer, we segmented brain regions and measured volume and cortical thickness from MRI scans pooled across multiple cohorts (N = 3433; ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD), including healthy controls, prodromal and clinical AD cases, and bvFTD cases. Employing the Web Ontology Language (OWL), we built a semantic model encoding hierarchical anatomical information. Additionally, we created summary visualizations based on sunburst plots for visual inspection of the information stored in the ontology.
          
          
            Results
            Our computational framework dynamically estimated and aggregated regional pathological deviations across different levels of neuroanatomy abstraction. The disease similarity index derived from the volumetric and cortical thickness deviations achieved an AUC of 0.88 for separating AD and bvFTD, which was also reflected by distinct atrophy profile visualizations.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The proposed automated pipeline facilitates visual comparison of atrophy profiles across various disease types and stages. It provides a generalizable computational framework for summarizing pathologic findings, potentially enhancing the physicians’ ability to evaluate brain pathologies robustly and interpretably.},

However, to advance the field of computer-aided material reuse and support its integration into circular construction practices, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive overview of the available methods and their applications. We address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the literature on the role of computational design in facilitating the reuse of building elements, followed by analyzing the interrelationships between optimization methods, materials, and geometric dimensions of reclaimed materials. We then synthesize the identified approaches, offering guidelines that assist stakeholders in selecting suitable computational methodologies for integrating non-standard materials into design processes. Our findings highlight current knowledge gaps in algorithm scalability, performance integration, and the advancement of hybrid computational methods needed to unlock the full potential of computational design for a circular built environment.},

To address the above issues, this study introduces generative AI into human-computer collaborative programming learning and proposes a dialogue-negotiated human-computer collaborative programming learning method based on generative AI. The method focuses on the problems-solving process and constructs multiple agents through Prompt design, which enable students to improve their computational thinking and master programming skills in the process of human-computer interaction for problem-solving. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a 10th grade computer programming course in a high school. 43 students in the experimental group learned with the proposed method, while 42 students in the control group adopted the traditional computer-supported human-computer collaborative programming learning method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method more significantly improved students’ computational thinking, programming learning attitudes, and learning achievement. This study provides theoretical foundations and application reference for future generative AI-assisted human-computer collaborative teaching.},

  abstract = {Terms such as ‘public’, ‘public good’, ‘public value’ and ‘public domain’ occur frequently in policy documents. Without a sense of what ‘public’ means, however, not just in everyday language, but as a ‘thick concept’ that has acquired resonance over time, there can little point deploying the terms in policymaking. The dilemma is especially acute for those trying rethink the relationship between economics and its conventional hierarchy of concepts and culture as a public good (‘the foundations’). This includes both heterodox economic approaches and policymakers working pragmatically to add legitimacy to their terms, by expanding how they are classified and operate. This article examines the concept of ‘the public realm’ as found in Hannah Arendt’s
            The Human Condition
            (1958) and as it might be taken up by cultural policymaking today. The first section examines innovation economist Mariana Mazzucato’s arguments for revising the concept of ‘the common good’. The second section tackles the parts of
            The Human Condition
            dealing with ‘the public realm’ directly. The broad argument is that the histories, interdisciplinary existences and patterns of use of thick concepts are crucial to their meaning and sense as policymaking terms. I argue that Arendt’s ‘thinking thickly’ is instructive for those aiming to engage questions around the public value of culture and to repurpose state action in the cultural sector. The conclusion examines the UK Bennett Institute’s Working Paper, ‘Measurement of Social and Cultural Infrastructure’ (Bennett Institute for Public Policy, 2024) asking whether its use of key term is adequate to its policy object. What challenges do policymakers face now as they try to tack away from neoliberalism’s impasses but with no obvious alternative pathway on offer?},

This study investigated the impact of a Critical Thinking-based Tactical Training Program (TPCT) on specific technical skills—passing accuracy and ball control—in U-8 football players (mean age: 7.9 ± 0.7 years). A quasi-experimental design was employed with 32 participants (experimental group: n = 15, control group: n = 17). The experimental group underwent ten 60-min training sessions that combined tactical principles (width, penetration, mobility, space) with critical thinking exercises, while the control group followed traditional technical drills without tactical or cognitive components. The experimental group showed significant improvements in passing accuracy (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: W = 0.0, p = 0.002, effect size: −1.00) and ball control (paired t-test: t = 8.67, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.23). In contrast, the control group did not exhibit significant changes in either skill (p &gt; 0.05). These results suggest that integrating tactical principles and critical thinking exercises into training enhances technical skills in young players. The TPCT offers a promising approach for improving player development, providing both technical and cognitive benefits in grassroots football training.},

With the popularity of the Internet and social media, a considerable amount of information flocks to the public’s field of vision, which puts forward higher requirements for the timeliness, personalization, and creativity of media content. However, the traditional manpower-intensive content creation methods have made it challenging to meet the fast-paced needs of modern society. The fast-paced life of modern times has prompted people to pursue rapid access to and digestion of information. Traditional human-intensive content creation, such as writing, editing, and reviewing, can no longer keep up with this immediate demand. At the same time, audience segmentation requires media content to be accurately positioned, provide personalized services, and respond quickly to market changes. In today’s information explosion, maintaining high-quality content has become the core competitiveness of media, but it is difficult to balance timeliness and accuracy and depth of content in a manpower-intensive way. Therefore, in order to solve the existing problems, this study develops an intelligent content creation auxiliary system through natural language processing and reinforcement learning technology. Firstly, an NLP module is established to parse and generate high-quality text that conforms to grammatical rules and logical structure. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning mechanism is introduced to enable the system to have self-learning ability, and the strategy is constantly adjusted in multiple attempts to maximize the relevance and attractiveness indicators of the content. The system is applied to the natural environment of a prominent news website. Experiments show that within 3 months after the implementation of the system, compared with traditional hand-made manuscripts, the average click-through rate of the content created or recommended by it has increased by about 30%, and the user retention time has been extended by nearly 25%.},

  abstract = {Introduction:
            Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is utilized during cardiovascular surgery to maintain organ oxygen supply and blood perfusion instead of cardiopulmonary function. Three primary methods of artery cannulation used for CPB include ascending aortic cannulation (AscAoC), right axillary artery cannulation (rAxAC), and femoral artery cannulation (FAC).
          
          
            Methods:
            In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulation technology was employed to analyze aorta and main branches of 62 patients undergoing CPB with different arterial cannulation schemes, observing carotid artery (CarA) perfusion and characteristics.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Results indicate that the total perfusion of bilateral CarAs using the three cannulation methods was sufficient when there was no significant variation in arterial morphology. Without considering the peripheral resistance and the body’s autoregulatory function, the right CarA was less perfused than the left CarA under AscAoC and rAxAC, leading to perfusion imbalance. Especially heteroplastic patients with rAxAC may be at risk of the right CarA hypoperfusion during CPB. FAC provides balanced and adequate perfusion of both hemispheres without stenosis or dissection of the aorta.},

This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use. Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency. The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.},

In this article, I ask what it means to inherit and care for the contested archive of the womyn's land movement and the potentialities it preserves for future feminist theorising while remaining committed to trans inclusion and antiracist and anticolonial praxis. Drawing from the papers of womyn's land culturemakers Ruth and Jean Mountaingrove, I argue for a more complex understanding of what it means to ‘inherit’ this work for feminists interested in lineages of land-based feminist thought. By more fulsomely accounting for the possibilities that emerge from non-biological and queer forms of intergenerational exchange at play on the land, I argue for the vitality of the ‘messiness’ of this archive as a source of its own feminist pedagogy, proposing a process of ‘thinking-with’ these archives as part of a web of engagements rather than a linear genealogy.},

  abstract = {This manuscript studies various process parameters like cutting velocity, feed rate, and cooling condition (dry, cryogenic, and emulsion) during drilling experiments performed on super-duplex stainless steel (SDSS) 2507 with coated and uncoated drill bits. The thrust force ranged from a minimum of 878.8 N (uncoated tool and emulsion cooling) to a maximum of 2500.1 N (uncoated tool and dry cooling), while torque values ranged from 19.87 to 2249.6 Nm under varying conditions. It was observed that thrust force and torque increased with higher feed rates and reduced with higher cutting velocities. Emulsion cooling consistently produced the lowest reactions, with an average reduction of 43% in thrust force compared to dry cooling, while dry drilling resulted in the highest forces and torques due to increased friction and heat. The use of a coated tool reduced the thrust force by up to 12% on average compared to uncoated tools under the same conditions. All three parameters studied (cutting velocity, feed rate and cooling condition) had statistically significant effects on thrust force (p ≤ 0.05), while torque was mainly influenced by feed rate and cooling condition, with a lesser effect from cutting velocity (p ≈ 0.06). The manuscript also presents the use of various computer-based modelling methods, including linear regression (R
            2
             = 0.9357 for thrust force), exponent-law relations (R

            2

  abstract = {As the global energy crisis and environmental problems become increasingly severe, electric vehicles have become carrier transportation field due to their zero-emission and energy-saving characteristics. Large-scale popularization of electric vehicles has brought dual impacts, increase grid load fluctuations; on the other hand, through reasonable charging regulation and vehicle-network interaction, electric vehicles can be used as distributed energy storage resources to improve the efficiency and stability of power grid operation. However, at present, the research on the decision-making influencing factors of the interaction is still insufficient, and it is urgent to discuss its key driving factors and optimization paths in depth. Based on the actual data analysis, this paper makes an empirical study on the influencing factors of interactive decision-making between electric vehicles and power grid by using multiple regression model. The research results show that the charging behavior of electric vehicle owners is mainly affected by the fluctuation of electricity prices, charging convenience and renewable energy penetration rate. At the grid level, the increase in the proportion of distributed photovoltaic installed capacity has significantly increased the V2G participation rate. In addition, under different policy incentives, there are significant differences in the willingness of car owners to accept V2G: subsidy policies can increase the participation rate of car owners by 15%–20%. Based on this, this paper puts forward suggestions such as optimizing the charging pricing mechanism, improving the coverage of smart charging infrastructure, and promoting policy innovation related to vehicle-network interaction.},

  abstract = {Many communist regimes have presided over episodes of rapid industrial development, often coupled by the establishment of a planned economic system wherein the state replaces the market as the primary provider of essential resources and services. We argue that life experience under a communist-style industrial workplace fosters a distinct and enduring set of norms and habits that shape how citizens engage with political authorities. Leveraging exogenous variations created by China’s Third Front (TF) campaign, a massive industrial relocation project that moved large-scale industrial-administrative complexes into rural and interior areas between the 1960s–1970s, we show that residents from former TF areas today are more active in contacting the government about personal and community affairs, and hold stronger preferences for state-sponsored participation channels over more contentious ones. Additional analyses suggest that these behavioral patterns are less a strategic response to current local conditions than a result of early socialization. These findings highlight important subnational variations in national communist experiences and underscore the persistent influence of early communist institutions on citizen-government interactions in late communist societies.},

Compared with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)- and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based approaches on 1,300 U.S. gun violence news articles, this method addresses LDA’s limitations by focusing on high-level framing elements rather than keywords and is less labor-intensive than BERT-based supervised learning.

However, most studies of CT development in middle graders have focused on visual programming, lacking evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Python programming. Therefore, this study first developed 16 Python programming courses based on the CodeCombat programming platform. Then we conducted a 16-week Python programming course intervention study with 79 middle school students in seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in China to clarify the impact of Python programming on middle graders’ CT. The results revealed that Python programming intervention significantly improved CT for seventh, eighth, and ninth graders. The analysis of interaction effects for grade and gender showed that Python programming was most beneficial for eighth graders in CT improvement. Meanwhile, we found that the difference in CT caused by the gender factor varied according to grade level. Specifically, the gender factor caused significant CT differences in eighth and ninth graders, and girls were better performers than boys. These findings enrich the outcomes of Python programming and CT education in middle schools and provide implications for frontline programming educators to conduct Python interventions.},

Yet despite increasing calls for more general application of systems thinking in these fields of research, the paradigm remains poorly understood and systemic analysis is rare, particularly in qualitative research.

It starts by providing a primer to systems thinking clarifying what systems thinking is as a research philosophy, and describing core systemic principles such as complex causality and emergence. It then introduces the novel method of Inductive Systemic Analysis. Combining the methodology of grounded theory with the principles and key concepts of systems thinking, this method was specifically designed to make systemic analysis both relatable and accessible to a wide range of qualitative researchers. Utilising the case example the method was developed with, the paper works through each step of the research process. It explains preparing for systemic research through boundary considerations and developing a systemic research question; and goes on to describe the four-step analytical process of “zooming in” and “zooming out”, exploring the data in different ways.

Distinct from the unscented particle filter, HUPF implements the high-order unscented transform instead of the conventional second-order variant. Due to the superior accuracy of the HUKF over the standard UKF, HUPF not only selects particles more judiciously, enhancing particle utilization, but also more effectively manages the tail decay rate of the proposal distribution. This approach enables HUPF to closely approximate the optimal posterior probability under typical Gaussian conditions. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through a bearing-only tracking model example.},

In the present study, the epidemic patterns of SARS-COV-2 disease have been investigated from the point of view of mathematical modeling. Also, the effect of quarantine has been considered. This mathematical model is designed in the form of fractional calculations along with a model predictive control (MPC) to monitor this model. The fractional-order model has the memory and hereditary properties of the system, which can provide more adjustable parameters to the designer. Because the MPC can predict future outputs, it can overcome the conditions and events that occur in the future. The results of the simulations show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) of fractional-order has a lower mean squared error in susceptible people compared to the optimal control of fractional-order (~3.6e-04 vs. 47.4). This proposed NMPC of fractional-order can be used for other models of epidemics.},

            Cancer can have a profound impact on the life of the patient, presenting challenges such as dealing with complex healthcare models and psychological burden. Implementing design thinking (DT) in cancer care can improve the quality of life for patients. Although DT has been used in healthcare, there is limited research highlighting use of DT in cancer care. The objective of this review is to explore the applications of DT within a cancer care context.
          
          
            Methods
            We systematically searched databases (PubMed Central, Scopus, and Medline) for relevant papers published between January 2018 and March 2023. Articles were identified using keywords: 'cancer', 'cancer care', 'oncology', 'design thinking', and 'design science'. Studies meeting our inclusion criteria were included and data was collected on the focus of study (i.e., design thinking and cancer care), target condition, target intervention and objective of the study. Thematic analysis was performed to identify recurring themes across studies. Articles were evaluated by the lead author and cross verified by the other two authors to reduce the risk of bias.
          
          
            Results
            Twenty studies were included out of the 160 articles identified whereby 11 focus on cancer care (5 patient-facing, 5 community-facing, and 1 provider-facing studies) and 9 on design thinking (5 patient-facing, 1 community-facing, and 3 provider-facing studies). Overall, seven themes were identified with several subthemes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our findings indicate that design thinking has been successfully applied to improve patient experiences in cancer care. By involving various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and communities, design thinking helps better understand real world problems. However, there is a gap in design thinking research concerning the long-term evaluation and scalability of design thinking-based interventions. Additionally, our findings suggest that mixed methods approach for future studies would support to establish more empirical evidence in this domain.},

            Methods:
            In this study, the behavior of 2 types of SMA stents with different metallurgical properties was studied using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Tracheal geometry was obtained from CT images of a healthy man. Then, a computational model of a real human trachea was selected to analyze the deformation of the trachea after implantation of the prosthesis. Finally, it was analyzed under the maximum average static pressure of the entrance to the trachea using the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) approach. A mesh based on unstructured elements for air and structured elements for the tracheal wall was created to perform simulations using ANSYS software.
          
          
            Results:
            The deformation of the stent was compared and analyzed with the deformation of the healthy trachea in the absence of the stent. The results presented that the most deformation in the trachea before stenting is up to 8.3 mm. The behavior of SMA2 with a deformation of 5.8 mm was more consistent with the deformation conditions of the trachea for real body conditions without the presence of a stent.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            As much as the deformation is reduced by the degree of stress concentration at the connection point of the stent to the trachea, the risks of stent displacement and patient suffocation are avoided.},

  abstract = {Aims and objectives:
            This paper attempts to develop a predictive computational model of Cantonese–English code-switching (CS) in Hong Kong, informed by language-internal and “language-external” (e.g., social) factors. I analyze this bilingual practice with respect to these factors and evaluate how accurately a model informed by this analysis can forecast Cantonese–English lexical choice in the context of digital platform WhatsApp.
          
          
            Approach:
            A quantitative “bag-of-words” approach was used to analyze bilingual variability/choice. The paper will focus on analyzing the frequency distribution of English and Cantonese choice at the word level without considering information in peripheral constituents (i.e., part-of-speech of the preceding and succeeding word, collocations).
          
          
            Data and analysis:
            A 329,087-word sociolinguistic corpus of WhatsApp messages from 24 Hong Kong residents was used. The data were analyzed using principal components analysis, sentiment analysis, and Bayesian multivariate regression.
          
          
            Findings:
            Part-of-speech, style, proficiency in English and Cantonese as well as attitudes toward switching to Cantonese interact with matrix language to condition CS. Switches from Cantonese to English signal “interpersonality” whereas the maintenance of English in English-matrix clauses index “informationality.” Individual factors have less of an impact than other factors, suggesting uniformity within the community. Attitudes toward mixing and preference for frequent mixing do not correlate with rates of CS.

  abstract = {Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is now commonplace in myriad disciplines from sociology to psychology to environmental science and health and medicine. In the context of my home discipline, public health, CBPR is a collaborative research approach where participants and researchers co-design projects and move them to action to improve health outcomes. CBPR occurs on a lengthy continuum from minor (e.g., community advisory boards) to major (e.g., community PIs) community engagement. Despite numerous and growing examples and varied ways of defining and discussing CBPR, many self-identified CBPR researchers agree that participatory

Insofar as biological contextualization of the findings is concerned, the top enriched GO terms were skeletal system development, blood vessel development, and vasculature development. Molecular function terms highlighted signaling receptor binding, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and platelet-derived growth factor binding. Notably, the significant KEGG pathways included amoebiasis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and the relaxin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present computational biology integrative analyses of multiple datasets discovered new DEGs and seven hub genes, shedding light on molecular mechanisms of HD. These findings call for translational clinical omics research and may potentially lead to future precision medicine interventions and novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

However, the existing studies on the coordinated development of systems fail to consider the influence of human capital on specific systems, or identify the root causes of the complex state of the coordinated development. To solve the problem, this paper explores the modeling and simulation for the coordinated development of REEHCCS. Specifically, the REEHCCS structure was modeled, and reasonable evaluation indices were selected for coordination. Then, an REEHCCS coordination model was constructed, and the classification principles were detailed for the coordinated development of complex systems. On this basis, education and human capital were introduced to the dynamic Haavelmo model to identify the state and analyze the evolution of the REEHCCS. Finally, the proposed model was proved effective through simulation and case analysis. This study explores the complex interactions between regional education, economy, and human capital, and assesses their coordinated development through the construction of a coordination model and simulation experiments. The research findings indicate that the constructed model can effectively identify and analyze the coordinated development state and evolution trends of the regional education–economy–human capital system.},

The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if researchers observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can researchers reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in the understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.},

  abstract = {Introduction
            Diabetes is a major global health issue, requiring nursing interns to develop essential diabetes management skills. Traditional teaching methods are limited by clinical settings, hindering the development of comprehensive theoretical and clinical competencies. This study developed a Virtual Simulative Diabetes Care Program to address these limitations.
          
          
            Methods
            
              A quasi-experimental design was employed. Nursing interns were assigned to an intervention group (virtual simulation) or a control group (traditional face-to-face training). Self-directed learning ability and clinical thinking skills were assessed using the validated Independent Learning Ability Scale and Clinical Thinking Skills Scale. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were conducted, and data were analyzed using independent
              t
              -tests and Mann–Whitney
              U
              tests, with significance set at
              P
               &lt; .05.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              The intervention group showed significantly higher self-directed learning ability (104.53 ± 7.75 vs. 99.00 ± 13.77,
              P
               &lt; .05) and clinical thinking skills (99.71 ± 12.15 vs. 91.69 ± 17.44,
              P
               &lt; .05) compared to the control group. Within the intervention group, both abilities significantly improved from pre- to post-internship (
              P
               &lt; .05). Practical skills, including blood glucose monitoring and insulin injection, also improved, with higher scores in the intervention group. The virtual simulation program was rated as effective, with an overall score of 8.37 ± 1.20 and "Excellent" ratings for learning functionality.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            The virtual simulation-based diabetes care program significantly improved nursing interns’ learning and clinical skills.},

            Conclusion:
            Gene expression showed high levels between the moderate and severe groups, with emphasis on TMPRSS2 and IL-6 genes that performed better.

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel approach for trajectory tracking of a six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) collaborative robot manipulator using an adaptive fuzzy proportional derivative (PD) controller. Based on the dynamic modeling of the robot manipulator, the PD control law is designed, and the improved dung beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm is introduced using the good point set (GPS) method for population initialization and the sine strategy for convergence factor adjustment. Furthermore, a fuzzy adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the PD controller gain based on real-time errors. This article uses discrete Lyapunov iterative stability to analyze the global asymptotic stability of the robot closed-loop system. The experimental results verify that the DBO-fuzzy-PD controller is superior to the original PD controller. The ISE value is reduced from 3.4140 to 0.0384, and the IAE value is reduced from 1.9876 to 0.1843. The DBO-fuzzy-PD controller has better tracking accuracy and response speed than traditional PD. Experimental results show that the proposed DBO-fuzzy-PD controller significantly enhances the trajectory tracking performance of the 6-DOF collaborative robot manipulator.},

The study addresses key challenges, including the numerical stability and convergence of finite element implementations, with simulations of compact tension (CT) specimen fracture tests for two different steels demonstrating the accuracy and predictive capability of the GLD model. In addition, the paper delves into nonlocal damage models, presenting two key theoretical results: the attenuation of high-frequency components, where Gaussian kernels act as low-pass filters, and the connection of nonlocal formulations to a diffusion-like equation.

  abstract = {In the realm of educational data science, the utilization of advanced analytical techniques is increasingly pivotal for optimizing pedagogical methods and implementing early interventions. This study introduces a predictive model employing deep learning technology for the analysis of student learning behavior. The model’s primary objective is to detect potential learning impediments at nascent stages, thereby facilitating timely and effective educational strategies to augment learning outcomes. Despite strides in behavioral prediction, challenges persist due to the dynamic and complex nature of educational data. Addressing these challenges, the proposed model integrates sequence pattern recognition with time-series analysis. The application of the PrefixSpan algorithm initiates the process, identifying sequential patterns in student learning behaviors and elucidating their temporal progression. Subsequently, an advanced ordered funnel analysis algorithm is employed, unveiling directional associations among diverse learning patterns. The final phase involves applying independent component analysis (ICA) to enhance the multi-layer long short-term memory (Multi-LSTM) network’s structure, thus enabling precise predictions of student outcomes in the context of early interventions. The results underscore the efficacy of deep learning in deciphering intricate behavioral patterns and underscore its potential in personalized educational interventions. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the model’s capacity to harness the intricacies of educational data, thereby contributing significantly to the field of personalized education and precise teaching methodologies. The innovative aspect of this study lies in the comprehensive application of the PrefixSpan algorithm, the ordered funnel analysis algorithm, and the Multi-LSTM network architecture. A holistic model for predicting student learning behavior is proposed, coupled with early interventions, which enables educators to better understand student learning conditions and implement effective measures to enhance student learning outcomes.},

The whole intelligent building management system includes business system management module, authorization management module, client module, and data linkage module. The client module visually displays the data in the building through charts and other means. The data linkage module uses sensors, devices, and communication technologies to collect various environmental parameters in the building and equipment operating status and other information, and sends the information to the data center or the cloud for subsequent processing. In the monitoring of energy consumption information, the electricity consumption of Building C was 181 KWH; the water consumption was 98 tons, and the gas consumption was 75 cubic meters.

  abstract = {Envisioning new kinds of operations requires systematically developing architectures, work procedures, and artifacts to support human and machine agents in coordinating within dynamic environments. Accurately predicting how envisioned operations will unfold is challenging as (1) early design-phase descriptions of architectures, work procedures, and artifacts are often underspecified, and (2) key outcomes of interest emerge from interactions between cognitive work and environmental dynamics. This paper discusses how computational simulation of work can serve as a discovery tool for envisioning future operations. We introduce a three-phase approach using the Work Models that Compute (WMC) framework, which involves converting paper-based representations of work into computational models, developing scenarios and test conditions, and simulating work dynamics to analyze emergent behaviors. We illustrate this approach through a case study on developing contingency management procedures for envisioned air transport operations, specifically Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The case study demonstrates how computational simulation can (1) reveal the need for clearer design specifications, (2) uncover interactions and emergent behavior that may lead to undesirable outcomes, such as coordination surprises, and (3) identify trade-offs between multiple design options. Insight from simulation can complement other cognitive systems engineering methods to refine and enhance the feasibility and robustness of envisioned operations.},

  abstract = {One way to cope with crises is by attributing their ultimate causes to malevolent conspiracies. As crises are rarely simple, and may involve an interplay between multiple, co-occurring threats, we suggest that conspiracy thinking mainly occurs among individuals who experience conditions of threat complexity – such as socioeconomic vulnerability paired with a sense of helplessness in society, and who are also sufficiently paranoid to infer a conspiracy. In the present study, we focused on financial strain and disempowerment, as two relevant threats which were both dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and hypothesized a three-way interaction between financial strain, disempowerment and paranoia in predicting conspiracy thinking. This hypothesis was supported in both cross-national (

  abstract = {Mudstone is extensively distributed in the open-pit mining area of Xianfeng Coal Mine in Yunnan, China. Since 2018, with the continuous rainfall, mudstone landslide has gradually emerged as a serious issue in the region. However, there are currently scarce research reports on rainfall-induced mudstone landslide. Therefore, this paper takes the northern slope of the Xianfeng Coal Mine as an example. Based on on-site field investigations and real-time monitoring data, the paper, while analyzing the characteristics of slope deformation, elucidates the impact of rainfall and geological lithology on the superficial failure of landslides. Analysis of existing data indicates that during sustained periods of rainfall, the infiltration process of rainwater undergoes a transformation. Initially, a major portion of the rainwater flows along the surface of the slope, while in the later stages, a significant portion of it infiltrates vertically along the slope surface and cracks. Consequently, the mode of slope deterioration also undergoes a transformation. Additionally, under the influence of rainfall infiltration, the mudstone layer at the base of the slope undergoes expansive deformation, resulting in a significant reduction in the shear strength of the slope.},

  abstract = {With the increasing maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in the field of educational management has become an important way to improve the quality and efficiency of education. In particular, in music education management, the introduction of AI technology has brought revolutionary changes to the traditional education model. This paper first discusses the application background of AI in music education management and the opportunities and challenges it brings, especially the potential impacts on teaching quality assessment, resource allocation, and educational policy formulation. However, current research shows that existing AI application methods have deficiencies in processing complex data, algorithm generalization capabilities, and adaptability to specific music education scenarios. In response to these deficiencies, this paper proposes two research contents: one is an intelligent decision support system based on an improved actor-critic framework, aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of music education management by simulating complex decision-making processes; the other is using a time series prediction model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the technology trends in music education, which can capture educational dynamics and provide data support for future educational policies and resource allocation. The research in this paper not only provides new theoretical and practical perspectives for the application of AI in the field of music education management but also provides a scientific basis for the realization of personalized and precise management in music education.},

  abstract = {The traditional library recommendation method mainly relies on manual analysis of readers’ reading history, book classification, and user feedback to achieve personalized recommendation, but this method has limitations such as low efficiency and difficulty in accurately capturing users’ complex needs. In view of this, this paper innovatively designs a recommendation system based on Wide &amp; Deep model. The system utilizes a linear model (Wide part) to process hand-constructed features as a way to remember specific user behavioural patterns; at the same time, high-dimensional sparse features are processed with the help of a deep neural network (Deep part) to capture the complex relationship between user interests. After both outputs are further processed by the fully connected layer, the model outputs the probability distribution of each category through Softmax function and then predicts the book categories that users may be interested in. The experimental results show that the model has excellent performance, with an AUC score of over 99%, showing a strong differentiation ability; precision is close to 97%, recall is close to 96%, and F1 value is close to 54%, which not only can accurately recommend the book resources that the user is interested in but also can effectively cover the diversified needs of the user, and provide a better solution for personalized recommendation service in libraries.},

  abstract = {In choral performances, the choral conductor’s gesture recognition is crucial, as it directly affects the overall performance of the choir. The posture recognition of choral conductors focuses on static states. This recognition method is difficult to fully capture spatial and temporal information, and has a slow response speed, which affects recognition accuracy and real-time performance. Based on OpenPose, this article developed an Inception-LSTM-TSN hybrid CNN model for posture recognition of choral commanders. Firstly, the pose extraction network VGG19 in the OpenPose algorithm was replaced with MobileNet-V3, and then a CNN network for two-stream pose recognition was constructed. The Inception network was then introduced to extract temporal information, the LSTM network was used to extract temporal information, and the EfficientNet-B3 optimized TSN was used for segmentation to obtain image information for choral commander pose recognition. Finally, the results of the two branches of the constructed hybrid two-stream convolutional neural network (H2SCNN) model can be fused using the average fusion method to output the choral conductor pose recognition results. The experiment was based on the publicly available dataset ConductorMotion100 and the self-built dataset CCD for choral conductor pose recognition. The results showed that the pose recognition performance of ConductorMotion100 in the public dataset was better than that of the self-built dataset CCD. The accuracy of H2SCNN model was as high as 97.8%, which was 7.1% higher than VGG19 static image processing, and the parameter size was only 32.7 M. The experimental results show that the H2SCNN model, combined with spatial and temporal information, significantly improves the accuracy of pose recognition, achieves good real-time performance, and greatly ensures the smooth performance of the choir.},

This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of a TSF proposed for decommissioning under seismic loading using the finite element time-history method. The study comprehensively analyzes dynamic deformation, seismic-induced permanent deformation, and pore water pressure changes, while identifying potential liquefaction zones and slope safety factors after seismic events. Results show that stress levels in the tailings dam remain low under applied dynamic loads, indicating a significant safety margin. Liquefaction zones are mainly concentrated in the shallow surface layers of the tailings beach, particularly in the fine sand and silt layers, with no liquefaction observed in the dam slope. The dam body’s deformation accumulates over the duration of seismic shaking, reaching a final value of 11.95 cm. The minimum slope safety factors during seismic events meet regulatory requirements, confirming dam slope stability. The findings provide a scientific basis for the design of TSF decommissioning projects.},

Traditional maintenance procedures are frequently costly, risky, and time-consuming, with staff working directly on live wires. The use of virtual reality (VR) modeling and simulation, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), provides a novel method for improving the design, planning, and maintenance of such systems. The major goal of this research is to create a VR-based platform that incorporates a Shark Nose Optimizer with Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (Shark-GBDT) algorithms for simulating the behavior of LL-PDN, enabling engineers to visualize, and forecast problems before it happens. It uses VR modeling approaches to rebuild power systems and Shark-GBDT-driven predictive models to predict possible faults or maintenance demands. Key findings show that the VR simulation enhances design and defect detection accuracy, allowing for real-time visualizations that aid decision-making. The proposed method is implemented using Python software. In a comparative analysis, the suggested method is assessed with various evaluation measures such as fault detection accuracy (94%), prediction accuracy (93%), time to identify faults (2100 seconds), maintenance downtime (13,800 seconds) and cost of maintenance (70,000). The Shark-GBDT method improves these simulations by detecting possible faults based on prior performance data, optimizing maintenance scheduling, and reducing downtime.

As of January 2024, the total number of charging infrastructure nationwide has reached 8.861 million units, a year-on-year increase of 63.7%, and there are 3624 battery swap stations. The popularity of new energy vehicles puts forward higher requirements for charging infrastructure. As an important supply station for new energy vehicles, public charging, and swapping stations have new energy access, energy storage configuration, and topology that directly affect charging efficiency, grid stability, and economy. This paper profoundly studies the new energy access, storage configuration, and public charging and swapping station topology. Analysis shows that new energy access has significant advantages. Experimental data show that in some areas with sufficient sunlight, using solar photovoltaic panels as the primary energy access method can provide up to 30% of energy supply, significantly reducing operating costs and carbon emissions. Energy storage system configuration is equally critical. By establishing an optimization model, the influence of different energy storage devices on the operating efficiency of charging and swapping stations is analyzed. Experimental results show that using a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system, combined with appropriate charging and discharging strategies, can significantly improve energy utilization and response speed, provide power support during peak hours, smooth power grid fluctuations, and improve stability.},

The analysis is performed for two helical wind turbine models with three- and four-blade configurations and under different operating conditions. Numerical simulations are performed using the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes method, along with the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic analogy. Validation of the performance of the computational model against experimental data demonstrates its ability to accurately predict the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic behavior of the turbine. The influence of the number of turbine blades and their distance from the center of the turbine on the generated noise is analyzed. The analysis is further focused on the highest power coefficient, obtained at the tip speed ratio of 1.8, and the sound pressure level (SPL) curves recorded by the receivers are analyzed. Predictions show that while the four-blade turbine has a higher SPL than the three-blade one at a downstream position of about four turbine diameters, the situation is reversed at farther downstream positions. The aeroacoustic findings of this research have direct implications for the proper installation of small vertical-axis Darrieus wind turbines in urban areas, where wind turbine generated noise is important.},

  abstract = {This article explores active labor market policies through a utopian lens, focusing on Swedish municipal activation services. Users of such services participated in visionary workshops and were invited to dream about what could be different in their (working) lives. In the analysis of the participants’ dreams, a tension between the internalization of and resistance to employability narratives, market logics, and capitalist structures emerges. By examining these dynamics, the article demonstrates how utopian thinking, rooted in experiences from the margins of the labor market, can inspire critiques of current labor systems and help in envisioning possible futures.},

  abstract = {With the boom of national sports, basketball is widely popular as a competitive sport. In basketball, footwork is particularly important. The transition of footwork creates a corresponding movement trajectory, and the analysis of both helps to improve the skill level of players. In order to identify the player’s stride, this study uses a smart insole containing sensors to extract the angular velocity and acceleration values of the stride and perform normalized preprocessing, and then operates the values according to the proposed Double Model Convolutional Neural Network (DMCNN) algorithm, and the advanced features of the steps are extracted to complete the recognition of the steps. Also, this study depicts the player’s motion trajectory based on the quadratic method and analyzes it. The experimental results show that the DMCNN algorithm is 100% accurate in recognizing all five steps and converges to a stable state at 28 iterations with a final stable fitness value of 0.15. The velocity and acceleration values transmitted by the sensors are highly consistent with the real values, and the trajectories depicted basically coincide with the real paths. Therefore, this study proves the effectiveness of the DMCNN algorithm in step recognition and the accuracy of the depicted motion trajectory.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of information technology promotes the rapid application of VR. Dance education is an important part of higher education, which has an extremely important impact on the mental health and comprehensive quality of college students. However, dance education in colleges and universities faces problems such as insufficient teaching resources, single teaching method, and difficult to assess the teaching effect. In order to solve these problems, we designed and implemented a VR technology-assisted dance education model in colleges and universities, and obtained data based on questionnaires to evaluate the relationship between VR-assisted dance education and the physical and mental health and comprehensive quality of college students. Through the experiment, we concluded that the dance education assisted by VR technology can effectively improve the comprehensive quality of students. The model cultivates students’ multifaceted abilities and levels, and enhances their competitiveness and development potential. The traditional dance education, on the other hand, has no significant effect on the comprehensive quality aspect of students. This may be due to the fact that dance education assisted by VR technology enables students to experience different dance styles, forms, and cultures in a virtual dance environment.},
