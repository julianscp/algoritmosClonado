Transforming legal texts into computational logic: Enhancing next generation public sector automation through explainable AI decision support,"Markus Bertl, Simon Price, Dirk Draheim",2026,International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.ijcce.2025.07.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcce.2025.07.003,scidir,"This research presents a novel approach for translating legal texts into machine-executable computational logic to support the automation of public sector processes. Recognizing the high-stakes implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal domains, the proposed method emphasizes explainability by integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques with natural language processing (NLP), employing scope-restricted pattern matching and grammatical parsing. The methodology involves several key steps: document structure inference from raw legal text, semantically neutral pre-processing, identification and resolution of internal and external references, contextualization of legal paragraphs, and rule extraction. The extracted rules are formalized as Prolog predicates and visualized as structured textual lists and graphical decision trees to enhance interpretability. To demonstrate the automatic extraction of explainable rules from legal text, we develop a Law-as-Code prototype and validate it through a real-world case study at the Austrian Ministry of Finance. The system successfully extracts executable rules from the Austrian Study Funding Act, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This validation not only underscores the practical applicability of our method, but also highlights promising avenues for future research, particularly the integration of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the rule extraction pipeline, while preserving traceability and explainability."
Continuous data assimilation for the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions,"Wancheng Wu, Haiyun Dong, Kun Wang",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117177,scidir,"This paper focuses on continuous data assimilation (CDA) for the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions. CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem with missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Then, the finite element approximation for the CDA is considered. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA."
Numerical analysis of multi-patch discontinuous Galerkin isogeometric method for full-potential electronic structure calculations,"Xiaoxu Li, Xucheng Meng",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117125,scidir,"In this paper, we study the multi-patch discontinuous Galerkin isogeometric (DG-IGA) approximations for full-potential electronic structure calculations.

We also provide a rigorous a priori error analysis of the DG-IGA approximations for linear eigenvalue problems. Furthermore, this work offers a unified analysis framework for the DG-IGA method applied to a class of elliptic eigenvalue problems. Finally, we present several numerical experiments to verify our theoretical results."

A line-search based SGD algorithm with Adaptive Importance Sampling,"Filippo Camellini, Serena Crisci, Anna De Magistris, Giorgia Franchini",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117120,scidir,"Stochastic Gradient methods are widely used in the field of supervised learning associated with big data. In this context, importance sampling-based algorithms have been proposed to minimize the variance of the stochastic gradient by introducing practical strategies to approximate the optimal sampling distribution, which is otherwise only theoretically accessible. In this paper, we propose a scheme that combines stochastic gradient descent with adaptive importance sampling with automatic step-size selection based on a stochastic Armijo-type line-search. This approach makes the method robust to the choice of the initial step-size, which would otherwise require a tuning phase that is computationally expensive or even impractical in certain big data scenarios. Moreover, we introduce different mini-batch variants to foster the practical acceleration of the original scheme. Finally, numerical experiments are presented on real datasets to validate the proposed method in the context of supervised classification problems."
Integrating subdivision schemes into SVM for improved signal classification,"V. Bruni, F. Pelosi, D.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely recognized as a powerful tool for signal classification due to its robust mathematical foundation and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. Subdivision schemes, originally developed in computer graphics for geometric modeling, offer a novel and parametric approach to feature preprocessing by iteratively refining input data through an efficient computational procedure. This paper studies the impact of subdivision schemes on SVM performance in terms of class separability and provides insights into the relationship between feature transformation and SVM response. Specifically, it investigates the theoretical and empirical implications of applying subdivision schemes to input features in SVM-based classification. The conditions under which these schemes preserve or enhance class separability are analyzed, focusing on the tension parameter which governs both the smoothness properties of the limit curve and the subdivision rule at each iteration. An estimation method for the tension parameter from the training data is also provided. Experimental results, performed in the context of signal classification based on the wavelet scattering transform, demonstrate that the appropriate selection of the tension parameter of the scheme can significantly enhance class separability, highlighting that subdivision schemes are a promising tool for improving classification accuracy in machine learning workflows."
A skew-symmetric-based mixed FEM for stationary MHD flows in highly porous media,"Lady Angelo, Jessika Camaño, Sergio Caucao",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117176,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117176,scidir,"We propose and analyze a new mixed variational formulation for the coupling of the convective Brinkman–Forchheimer and Maxwell equations for stationary magnetohydrodynamic flows in highly porous media. Besides the velocity, magnetic field, and a Lagrange multiplier associated with the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, our approach introduces a convenient translation of the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor as additional unknowns. Consequently, we obtain a five-field mixed variational formulation within a Banach space framework, where the aforementioned variables are the main unknowns of the system, exploiting the skew-symmetric property of one of the involved operators. The resulting mixed scheme is then equivalently written as a fixed-point equation, allowing the application of the well-known Banach theorem, combined with classical results on nonlinear monotone operators and a sufficiently small data assumption, to prove the unique solvability of the continuous and discrete systems. In particular, the analysis of the discrete scheme requires a quasi-uniformity assumption on the mesh.

The computational problem is neither known to be NP-hard nor to be in NP. We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for each of these containers based on a reduction to finding a shortest Hamiltonian path in a weighted graph, which in turn models the problem of stabbing the centers of the input balls while keeping them disjoint. We also show that for n such balls, a container of volume O ( n d − 1 d ) is always sufficient and sometimes necessary. As a byproduct, this implies that for d ⩾ 2 there is no finite size ( d + 1 ) -dimensional convex body into which all d-dimensional unit-radius balls can be packed simultaneously."
Hybrid butter-flower algorithm: Novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm,"Utkarsh Mahadeo Khaire, Shashank R Hiremath, Kartik Londhe, C B Manjusha, Antara Singha Mahapatra",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117148,scidir,"This study presents the Hybrid Butter-Flower Algorithm (HBFA), an innovative metaheuristic optimization approach that combines the strengths of the Sunflower Optimization Algorithm (SOA) and the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to improve convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness. While proficient in exploration, SOA may lack the aggressive exploitation required for swift convergence, potentially slowing down solution refinement. However, BOA might experience premature convergence in challenging milieu that results in demurrer in local optima. HBFA handles these challenges by amalgamating SOA’s unique exploration nuances with BOA’s effectual exploitation techniques, assuring an optimum exchange between orbicular and localized search. The algorithm is assessed on 23 unimodal and multimodal standard functions and six constrained mechanical design optimization problems with real-world applications. The performance of HBFA is benchmarked against nine state-of-the-art optimization methods, including PSO, SSA, and HSA, based on metrics such as best solution, average solution, and convergence rate. The results demonstrate that HBFA attains the highest performance efficiency (96.69 %), accomplishing all competitive algorithms by epochal margins, with amelioration ranging from 21 % to 63 % over conventional approaches. Notably, the proposed HBFA is 83.25 % faster in finding the optimal solution than other algorithms without falling for premature convergence and local optima. The superiority of HBFA is further validated through Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman statistical tests, with an average p-value of 3.14E-10, confirming its statistically significant advantage. Given to its adaptive nature and rapid convergence, HBFA emerges as a powerful tool for addressing complex optimization challenges in engineering, artificial intelligence, and industrial applications."

These problems are formulated using asymptotic expansions of the solution with respect to a small parameter, which represents the characteristic size of spatial heterogeneity. When studying diffusion equations with contrasting coefficients, special attention is given to nonlocal models with weakly conducting inclusions. In this case, macro-level processes are described by integro-differential equations, where the difference kernel is determined by the solution of a nonstationary cell problem. The main contribution of this work is the development of a computational framework for the homogenization of nonstationary processes, accounting for memory effects. The effective diffusion tensor is computed using a standard numerical procedure based on finite element discretization in space. The memory kernel is approximated by a sum of exponentials obtained from solving a partial spectral problem on the periodicity cell. The nonlocal macro-level problem is transformed into a local one, where memory effects are incorporated through the solution of auxiliary nonstationary problems. Standard two-level time discretization schemes are employed, and unconditional stability of the discrete solutions is proved in appropriate norms. Key aspects of the proposed computational homogenization technique are illustrated by solving a two-dimensional model problem."

To tackle this, we propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to PINNs, our framework requires less GPU memory and a shorter training time. Furthermore, the exponential convergence of the spectral basis makes our approach more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between the physics domain and the spectral domain, we provide a strategy to efficiently train networks in spectral domain. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network."

In this work, we consider a generalization of the Beavers–Joseph interface condition recently developed using homogenization and boundary layer theory. This extension is applicable not only for the parallel flows to the fluid–porous interface as its predecessor, but also for arbitrary flow directions. To solve the Stokes–Darcy problem with these generalized interface conditions efficiently, we develop and analyze a Robin–Robin domain decomposition method using Fourier analysis to identify optimal weights in the Robin interface conditions.

In this paper, we develop a robust and generalizable multiscale modeling framework based on multicontinuum homogenization to derive effective macroscopic equations in shrinking domains. The method distinguishes multiple continua according to the physical characteristics (e.g., channel widths), and couples them via space–time local cell problems formulated on representative volume elements. These local problems incorporate temporal derivatives and domain evolution, ensuring consistency with underlying fine-scale dynamics. The resulting upscaled system yields computable macroscopic coefficients and is suitable for large-scale simulations. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and potential applicability of the method to complex time-dependent engineering problems."

Numerous methods have been developed to address this issue, providing good results when the data is continuous. Among these, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) method has proven to be an effective strategy for fitting data, finding applications in both statistics and applied mathematics. However, the presence of isolated discontinuities in the data can lead to undesirable artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon, which adversely affects the quality of the approximation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Moving Least Squares method with the well-established non-linear Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method. This combination aims to construct a non-linear operator that enhances the accuracy of approximations near discontinuities while maintaining the order of accuracy in smooth regions. We investigate the properties of this operator in one dimension, demonstrating its effectiveness through a series of numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings."

Constructing wavelets by welding segments of smooth functions,Maarten Jansen,2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117160,scidir,"The construction of B-spline wavelet bases on nonequispaced knots is extended to wavelets that are piecewise segments from any combination of smooth functions. The extended wavelet family thus provides multiresolution basis functions with support as compact as possible and belonging to a user controlled smoothness class. The construction proceeds in two phases. In the first phase of segmentation, a set of smooth functions is used in the welding of compact supported, piecewise smooth basis functions. These piecewise smooth basis functions are refinable, meaning that they can be written as linear combinations of similar basis functions constructed on a finer grid of knots. The expression of the linear combination between the bases at two scales is known as a refinement or two-scale equation. In the second phase, the refinability enables the construction of a wavelet transform. To this end, the refinement equation of the piecewise smooth scaling functions is factored into a lifting scheme, to which the desired properties of the subsequent wavelet basis can then be added. Special attention is paid to proper boundary treatment. Next to the details of the construction, the paper discusses the conditions for it to fit into the classical framework of multiresolution analyses."

This framework could embed delay differential equations into neural networks to accommodate the diverse requirements of DDEs in terms of initial conditions, control equations, and known data. PINN-DDEs adjust the network parameters through automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms to minimize the loss function, thereby obtaining numerical solutions to the delay differential equations without the grid dependence and polynomial interpolation typical of traditional numerical methods. In addressing inverse problems, the PINN-DDEs framework can utilize observational data to perform precise estimation of single or multiple delay parameters, which is very important in practical mathematical modeling. The results of multiple numerical experiments have shown that PINN-DDEs demonstrate high precision in both forward and inverse problems, proving their effectiveness and promising potential in dealing with delayed differential equation issues."

Fractional collocation method for linear neutral weakly singular Volterra integro-differential equations,"Jiao Wen, Mingfa Fei, Zheng Ma",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117147,scidir,"In this paper, we investigate a fractional collocation method for linear neutral Volterra integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernels. The proposed method utilizes piecewise polynomials of fractional order, which match the typical singularity of this kind of problems well. A rigorous convergence analysis proves that the optimal orders of convergence can be attained under appropriate choices of the fractional exponent and graded mesh. Superconvergence results are also achieved. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results."

                      Both upper bounds are tight in the sense that there are input instances that require these many cameras. Our proofs are constructive and suggest simple polynomial-time algorithms for placing these many cameras.

To achieve more successful results, improvements are made on these metaheuristic algorithms. This study aims to enhance the performance of the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) Algorithm, a neighborhood-based metaheuristic algorithm. To this end, MBO is implemented on a high-performance computing (HPC) architecture using Open MPI, and the Multi-Island Distributed Migrating Birds Optimization (MIDMBO) Algorithm is developed. MIDMBO is a distributed metaheuristic optimization algorithm that utilizes multiple islands, where successful solutions migrate between islands. The migration process between islands, facilitated by MPI, enables MIDMBO to generate more successful outcomes. Therefore, studies focused on the migration process are of great importance. In this study, the relationship between algorithm performance and variations in fundamental migration parameters such as migration rate, migration interval, and the number of islands is examined. Regression analyses are performed on the results obtained from MIDMBO, and the model that best explains performance variation is identified. Additionally, artificial neural network (ANN) models are constructed, and the degree to which changes in parameter values explain the results is evaluated."

New approach for solving sequences of saddle-point linear systems,"A. Badahmane, A. Ratnani, H. Sadok",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117157,scidir,"Many practical applications of Navier–Stokes problems require solving sequences of saddle-point systems. These systems often arise from the mixed-finite element discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations. A popular strategy to solve them is by combining preconditioning techniques with Krylov subspace methods, which has proven effective in achieving computational efficiency. Since global Krylov subspace methods are specifically designed for solving saddle-point problems with multiple right-hand sides, they cannot be utilized to solve sequences of these problems. We propose an alternative approach applicable to matrices with a saddle-point structure. In this new approach, projection into the null-space of the block-(2,1) of the saddle-point matrix leads to a linear system with several right-hand sides. Due to the large scale and ill-conditioned nature of these linear systems, effective solvers must be implemented. Instead of applying a standard iterative method to solve each linear system independently, it is often more effective to apply a global method. Here, we develop and assess various methods for solving linear systems with several right-hand sides, with a special focus on the preconditioned global conjugate gradient (PGCG) method. We show that our suggested approach is highly effective for sequences of saddle-point systems with varying matrices. The efficiency of our new approach is evaluated by measuring computational time."

Commutator-free Cayley methods,"B. Wembe, C. Offen, S. Maslovskaya, S. Ober-Blöbaum, P.

Lie group numerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group. Thus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as unitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems, for instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group integrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie groups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and need to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve the Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of Cayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups while being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley–Magnus methods the method is also free from nested matrix commutators."
Solutions of Volterra–Fredholm type fractional integro-differential equations in terms of shifted Gegenbauer wavelets compared with the solutions by Genocchi polynomial method,"Serenay Abalı, Ali Konuralp",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117056,scidir,"This research introduces a novel numerical technique based on shifted Gegenbauer wavelets for solving Fredholm–Volterra fractional integro-differential equations (FVFIDEs), a class characterized by the presence of both Fredholm and Volterra integral parts. By assuming properties of the fractional derivative and applying the wavelet solution directly to the equation, the problem is transferred to finding the family of solutions of the system of algebraic equations, whose solutions are the coefficients of the series of wavelet solutions. The accuracy and efficiency of the Gegenbauer wavelet approach are primarily evaluated through a direct comparison against solutions generated using the Genocchi polynomials method for established test problems. The study demonstrates that the shifted Gegenbauer wavelet method provides precise and effective solutions, which were analyzed under varying resolution parameters and degrees of Gegenbauer polynomials."
Extended consistent Riccati expansion for investigating interaction between soliton and periodic wave for Drinfel’d–Sokolov–Wilson system,"Juan Wang, Jinfu Liang",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117083,scidir,"The consistent Riccati expansion (CRE) method is extended and applied to derive interaction solutions of the Drinfel’d-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW) system.

Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of these interactions is analyzed in detail."
Christoffel transform and multiple orthogonal polynomials,"Rostyslav Kozhan, Marcus Vaktnäs",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117121,scidir,"We investigate multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the system of measures obtained by applying a Christoffel transform to each of the orthogonality measures. We present an algorithm for computing the transformed recurrence coefficients and determinantal formulas for the transformed multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II. We apply these results to show that zeros of multiple orthogonal polynomials of an Angelesco or an AT system interlace with the zeros of the polynomials corresponding to its one-step Christoffel transform. This allows us to prove a number of interlacing properties satisfied by the multiple orthogonality analogues of classical orthogonal polynomials. For the discrete polynomials, this also produces an estimate on the smallest distance between consecutive zeros. We also identify a connection between the Christoffel transform of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonality systems containing a finitely supported measure. In consequence, the compatibility relations for the nearest neighbour recurrence coefficients provide a new algorithm for the computation of the Jacobi coefficients of the one-step or multi-step Christoffel transforms."

On numerical computation of inverses and determinants for generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices,"Xin Fan, Ji-Teng Jia",2026,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,Elsevier BV,10.1016/j.cam.2025.117076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2025.117076,scidir,"This paper investigates the inverses and determinants of generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices. We first present an explicit formula for the inverses of these matrices, based on tensor products and the inverses of general anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices. An efficient algorithm for matrix inversion is then proposed, reducing memory requirements for storing these matrices and simplifying analysis by leveraging the properties of tensor products. Additionally, we introduce a cost-effective algorithm for computing the determinants of generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices, transforming the problem into that of lower-order anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrix determinants. We also derive an explicit formula for determinant evaluation. Numerical results from MATLAB simulations demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and performance of the proposed algorithms, which are compared to MATLAB built-in functions, showing clear advantages in computational accuracy and speed."
