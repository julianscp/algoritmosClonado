  abstract = {Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs)
            are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads–particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)–exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04× speedup (up to 6.91×), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the intersection of music and coding has emerged as a cross-disciplinary approach to engage learners in both musical and computational expression. This article examines the motivations and framing of recent music and coding research through an analysis of 65 articles published between 2004 and 2024. We survey the key findings of this body of work, exploring the extent to which they generalize across diverse populations and educational contexts. We situate these findings within the broader aims of the field of computer science education, critiquing the use of music as a motivational tool in computing education rather than as a topic worthy of exploration in its own right. Methodological limitations are identified, with recommendations for future research to address these gaps. Drawing on theories of onto-epistemic heterogeneity, we call for a more inclusive approach to computing education that integrates sociocultural, historical, and critical perspectives to more effectively support learners from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a critical set of 21st-century skills that young learners must develop to be successful in contemporary work and life. As more K-12 schools begin to integrate CT into the curriculum, Elementary Preservice Teachers (EPSTs) must be prepared to teach CT to their future students. Therefore, elementary teacher preparation programs should explore ways to incorporate CT into their coursework, ensuring that EPSTs graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach CT. This study investigates the impacts of a 3-week CT module implemented in a technology integration course in an elementary teacher preparation program on EPSTs’ CT value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy. The purpose of the module was to introduce EPSTs to basic concepts and big ideas in CT, support their application of CT in block-based coding environments, and promote connection building between CT and authentic real-world scenarios that balance different types of CT activities. Guided by the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG), this study examined EPSTs’ learning as a dynamic process of change across the personal and external domains. The module was located in the external domain as a stimulus for learning, while the Teacher Beliefs about Coding and Computational Thinking (TBaCCT) instrument was used to assess changes in value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy within the personal domain. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to analyze pre- and post-surveys administered to 50 EPSTs and semi-structured interviews with four of the EPSTs. The results showed that the beliefs of the CT value of EPSTs evolved and their self-efficacy and teaching efficacy of CT significantly improved after participating in the module, suggesting that the interaction between external learning experiences and internal belief systems—facilitated by reflection and action—contributed to early professional growth. Notably, EPSTs also developed a more accurate understanding of CT, recognized the benefits of both plugged and unplugged CT activities, and expressed a desire for continued CT learning and professional development. Although EPSTs expressed concerns with the scarcity of physical computing toys in schools, they demonstrated a commitment to incorporating CT activities into their teaching and exploring alternative funding avenues to acquire such resources. Practical implications include potential approaches for elementary teacher preparation programs to embed CT into existing curricula.},

To this end, we construct a mathematical model that periodically estimate an optimal cache division ratio, by considering the factors of the ratios of read/write data amount, the cache hits, and the overhead of data transfer between the storage device and the host. Besides, we propose a scheme of proactive data flushing to write the output data to the underlying flash arrays, without impacts on I/O responsiveness. The trace-driven experiments show that our scheme can improve the overall I/O latency by

We also illustrate their applicability in addressing sufficient completeness problems, emphasising their utility in theoretical and practical contexts.},

To this end, we consider a simple language of monitors that observe sets of system executions and report verdicts w.r.t. a given Hyper-recHML formula. We first employ a unique omniscient monitor that centrally observes all system traces. Since centralised monitors are not ideal for distributed settings, we also provide a language for decentralized monitors, where each trace has a dedicated monitor; these monitors yield a unique verdict by communicating their observations to one another. For both the centralized and the decentralized settings, we provide a synthesis procedure that, given a formula, yields a monitor that is correct (i.e., sound and violation complete). A key step in proving the correctness of the synthesis for decentralized monitors is a result showing that, for each formula, the synthesized centralized monitor and its corresponding decentralized one are weakly bisimilar for a suitable notion of weak bisimulation.},

  abstract = {The remarkable progress of Vision Transformer (ViT) models has significantly advanced performance in computer vision tasks. However, the deployment of ViTs in resource-constrained environments remains a challenge, as the attention computation mechanisms within these models form a significant bottleneck, requiring substantial memory and computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TAFP-ViT, a tailored hardware-software co-design framework for Vision Transformers. On the software level, TAFP-ViT leverages a learnable compressor to perform multi-head shared compression on feature maps, and fuses decompression reconstruction, QKV generation and QKV processing together for calculation, thereby greatly reducing memory and computation requirements. Furthermore, TAFP-ViT combines dynamic inter-layer token pruning to eliminate unimportant tokens and hardware-friendly intra-block row pruning to diminish redundant computations. The proposed software design converts the calculations before and after SoftMax into dense and sparse triple matrix multiplication (TMM) forms respectively. On the hardware level, TAFP-ViT proposes a configurable systolic array (SA) to efficiently adapt to the QKV fusion computation pattern. The SA has flexible PE units that can effectively support general matrix multiplication (GEMM), dense and sparse TMM. The TMM and flexible dataflows allow TAFP-ViT to avoid handling transpositions and storing intermediate computation results, greatly enhancing computational efficiency. Besides, TAFP-ViT innovatively designs a Top-k engine to support dynamic pruning on the fly with high throughput and low resource consumption. Experiments show that the proposed TAFP-ViT achieves remarkable speedups of 123.91×, 29.5×, and 3.01∼ 20.65× compared to conventional CPUs, GPUs, and previous state-of-the-art works, respectively. Additionally, TAFP-ViT reaches a throughput of up to 731.5 GOP/s and an impressive energy efficiency of 77.9 GOPS/W.},

  abstract = {In the past, Arabic Dialects (AD) have been poorly documented linguistically due to the lack of written forms and orthographies. However, in recent years, AD have become more widely used as a means of communication since social media and the everywhere availability of the internet have created a massive overflow of information and textual data, leading to a growing interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for these dialects. The highly inflectional morphology and the lack of standard orthography for AD pose an important challenge for NLP work. In this article, we handle the problem of lacking standard orthography during our work to build a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic (EGY). To identify the guidelines for detecting conventional orthography, we depend on a corpus of 597,000 words that were gathered from various sources and genres. While analyzing the corpus morphologically, we handle the conventional orthography problem by assigning each word the conventional EGY Lemma and stem as close as possible to the EGY pronunciation no matter how it is typically written. Nevertheless, there are some common phenomena and complex cases involved in detecting conventional orthography during the morphological annotation process. Therefore, we take a closer look at and discuss these common phenomena and complex cases as we detect conventional orthography. These conventional orthographies are represented in a manner that facilitates the parsing of them correctly by the morphological analyzer. We tested the coverage of our morphological analyzer and compared it to one of the state-of-the-art morphological analyzers.},

Continuous monitoring of sleep posture, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movement is crucial for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders. Current monitoring solutions often disrupt natural sleep due to discomfort or raise privacy and instrumentation concerns. We introduce PillowSense, a fabric-based sleep monitoring system seamlessly integrated into a pillowcase. PillowSense utilizes a dual-layer fabric design. The top layer comprises conductive fabrics for sensing electrocardiogram (ECG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG), while the bottom layer features pressure-sensitive fabrics to monitor sleep location and movement. The system processes ECG and sEMG signals sequentially to infer multiple sleep variables and incorporates an adversarial neural network to enhance posture classification accuracy. We fabricate prototypes using off-the-shelf hardware and conduct both lab-based and in-the-wild longitudinal user studies to evaluate the system's effectiveness. Across 151 nights and 912.2 hours of real-world sleep data, the system achieves an F1 score of 88% for classifying seven sleep postures, and clinically-acceptable accuracy in vital sign monitoring. PillowSense's comfort, washability, and robustness in multi-user scenarios underscore its potential for unobtrusive, large-scale sleep monitoring.},

  abstract = {Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games provide means to characterize elementary equivalence for first-order logic, and by standard translation also for modal logics. We propose a novel generalization of Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games to hybrid-dynamic logics which is direct and fully modular: parameterized by the features of the hybrid language we wish to include, for instance, the modal and hybrid language operators as well as first-order existential quantification. We use these games to establish a new modular Fraïssé-Hintikka theorem for hybrid-dynamic propositional logic and its various fragments. We study the relationship between countable game equivalence (determined by countable Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games) and bisimulation (determined by countable back-and-forth systems). In general, the former turns out to be weaker than the latter, but under certain conditions on the language, the two coincide. As a corollary we obtain an analogue of the Hennessy-Milner theorem. We also prove that for reachable image-finite Kripke structures elementary equivalence implies isomorphism.},

  abstract = {We establish a generic, model-theoretic characterization of rational belief revision operators implementing the paradigm of minimal change according to the seminal work by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson (AGM). Our characterization applies to all Tarskian logics, that is, all logics with a classical model-theoretic semantics, and hence a wide variety of formalisms were used in knowledge representation and beyond, including many for which a model-theoretic characterization has hitherto been lacking. Our starting point is the approach by Katsuno and Mendelzon (K&amp;M), who provided such a characterization for propositional logic over finite signatures. We generalize K&amp;M’s approach to the setting of AGM-style revision over bases in arbitrary Tarskian logics, where
                    base
                    may refer to one of the various ways of representing an agent’s beliefs (such as belief sets, arbitrary or finite sets of sentences, or single sentences). Our first core result is a representation theorem providing a two-way correspondence between AGM-style revision operators and specific
                    assignments
                    : functions associating every base to a “preference” relation over interpretations, which must be total but is—in contrast to prior approaches—not always transitive. As our second core contribution, we provide a characterization of all logics for which our result can be strengthened to assignments producing transitive preference relations (as in K&amp;M’s original work). Alongside these main contributions, we discuss diverse variants of our findings as well as ramifications for other areas of belief revision theory.},

            *
            is equal to RE, a class including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP
            *
            can share unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works [53, 54] have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers’ shared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive system MIP

            [poly],
            O
            (1), where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show that noise completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share arbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is equivalent to NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) [53]. We also show that this collapse in power is due to noise, rather than the
            O
            (1) answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class the full power of RE = MIP

First, we give a new, deterministic tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided that it has a low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded third-order Fréchet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continuous.},

  abstract = {Barrier potentials gained popularity as a means for robust contact handling in physical modeling and for modeling self-avoiding shapes. The key to the success of these approaches is adherence to geometric constraints, i.e., avoiding intersections, which are the cause of most robustness problems in complex deformation simulation with contact. However, existing barrier-potential methods may lead to spurious forces and imperfect satisfaction of the geometric constraints. They may have strong resolution dependence, requiring careful adaptation of the potential parameters to the object discretizations.
          We present a systematic derivation of a continuum potential defined for smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces, starting from identifying a set of natural requirements for contact potentials, including the barrier property, locality, differentiable dependence on shape, and absence of forces in rest configurations. Our potential is formulated independently of surface discretization and addresses the shortcomings of existing potential-based methods while retaining their advantages.
          We present a discretization of our potential that is a drop-in replacement for the potential used in the incremental potential contact formulation [Li et al. 2020], and compare its behavior to other potential formulations, demonstrating that it has the expected behavior. The presented formulation connects existing barrier approaches, as all recent existing methods can be viewed as a variation of the presented potential, and lays a foundation for developing alternative (e.g., higher-order) versions.},

Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector represent a large fraction of global emissions and must be significantly curtailed to achieve ambitious climate goals. To stimulate the adoption of relevant technologies such as rooftop PV and heat pumps, governments and utilities have designed
            incentives
            that encourage adoption of decarbonization technologies. However, studies have shown that many of these incentives are inefficient since a substantial fraction of spending does not actually promote adoption. Further, these incentives are not equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups. In this article, we present a novel data-driven approach that adopts a holistic, emissions-based, and city-scale perspective on decarbonization. We propose an optimization model that dynamically allocates a total incentive budget to households to directly maximize the resultant
            carbon emissions reduction
            – this is in contrast to prior work, which focuses on metrics such as the number of new installations. We leverage techniques from the multi-armed bandits problem to estimate
            human factors
            , such as a household’s willingness to adopt new technologies given a certain incentive. We apply our proposed dynamic incentive framework to a city in the Northeast U.S., using real household energy data, grid carbon intensity data, and future price scenarios. We compare our learning-based technique to two baselines, one “status-quo” baseline using incentives offered by a state and utility, and one simple heuristic baseline. With these baselines, we show that our learning-based technique significantly outperforms both the status-quo baseline and the heuristic baseline, achieving up to 37.88% higher carbon reductions than the status-quo baseline and up to 28.76% higher carbon reductions compared to the heuristic baseline. Additionally, our incentive allocation approach is able to achieve significant carbon reduction even in a broad set of environments, with varying values for electricity and gas prices, and for carbon intensity of the grid. Finally, we show that our framework can accommodate
            equity-aware
            constraints to preserve an equitable allocation of incentives across socioeconomic groups while achieving 83.34% of the carbon reductions of the optimal solution on average.},

  abstract = {A formal context consists of objects, properties, and the incidence relation between them. Various notions of concepts defined with respect to formal contexts and their associated algebraic structures have been studied extensively, including formal concepts in formal concept analysis (FCA), rough concepts arising from rough set theory (RST), and semiconcepts and protoconcepts for dealing with negation. While all these kinds of concepts are associated with lattices, semiconcepts and protoconcepts additionally yield an ordered algebraic structure, called double Boolean algebras. As the name suggests, a double Boolean algebra contains two underlying Boolean algebras.
          
            In this article, we investigate logical and algebraic aspects of the representation and reasoning about different concepts with respect to formal contexts. We first review our previous work on two-sorted modal logic systems

            KF

            BM
            , in which semiconcepts and protoconcepts are also expressible. Based on the logical representation of semiconcepts and protoconcepts, we prove the characterization of double Boolean algebras in terms of their underlying Boolean algebras.

A key ingredient is that star-free closure coincides with another closure operator, defined in terms of regular operations where Kleene stars are allowed in restricted contexts.
          
          A consequence of this first result is that we can decide membership of a regular language in the star-free closure of a class whose separation problem is decidable. Moreover, we prove that separation itself is decidable for the star-free closure of any finite class, and of any class of group languages having itself decidable separation (plus mild additional properties). We actually show decidability of a stronger property, called covering.},

Computational cooling of qubits, whereby a subset of the qubits is cooled at the expense of heating the other qubits via the application of special sets of logic gates, offers a route to effectively cool qubits. Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.},

When revising by a sentence at the highest level of credibility, the operator behaves like a standard revision, if the sentence is at the second level of credibility, the revision process results in a standard contraction by the negation of that sentence. If the sentence is not credible, then the original belief set remains unchanged. In this article, we introduce a novel constructive method for two-level credibility-limited revision operators, based on a modified version of entrenchment relations. Additionally, we propose a semantics for this type of operators, based on Grove’s systems of spheres. Furthermore, we present axiomatic characterizations for the newly proposed operators.},

  abstract = {With the development of mobile technologies, users can easily access Online social networks (OSNs), consequently, massive contents including personal experiences, observations, or opinions are generated online. These contents are being shared and exchanged in OSNs, which have a significant influence on the minds of people toward politics, societies, economics, and so on. In this case, sentiment diffusion which focuses on how the process of information diffusion in OSNs is affected by sentiments has become an important issue. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the problem. Specifically, we first present the definition and classification of sentiment, introduce the most advanced computational sentiment analysis techniques, list their applications, and disclose available sentiment analysis resources. Then the main OSN components, functionalities, and structural features applied in modeling social networks are analyzed and summarized. Next, a thorough overview of the information diffusion technologies in OSNs, including graph and non-graph models is made. At last, a systematic and in-depth overview of the current state and issues of research on sentiment diffusion in OSNs is provided. This survey provides the necessary knowledge and new insights for relevant researchers to better understand the research state, remaining challenges, and future directions in this field.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has expanded its influence far beyond traditional boundaries in our society. One prominent application of artificial intelligence is the use of large language models, which have transcended their initial roles in high-tech industries and academic research and are now actively utilized by individual users. These models have continually improved over the years in their generative capabilities and performance across numerous tasks. However, they still pose a persistent risk of reproducing biases and stereotypes. Previous research has predominantly focused on quantitatively measuring biases in these large language models. In this study, we seek to assess not just the presence of bias itself, but the perception of stereotypes by these models via in-depth exploration of their responses. We demonstrate how the computational grounded theory framework, which integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, can be applied in this context to assess the conceptualization of stereotypes. Furthermore, we contrast language model results with a survey of 400 human participants who also completed similar prompts as the model in order to understand people’s perception of gender stereotypes. The results indicate substantial similarities between language model and human perceptions of stereotypes, highlighting that a model’s perception stems from societal perception of stereotypes.},

Three use cases showcase applications of the framework in real-world scenarios. The ultimate goal of this paper is to encourage transdisciplinary thinking in cybersecurity and any other discipline.

Lastly, we propose a hypersequent-based decision method for skeptical consequence which circumvents the need for early computation of all extensions.},

            domain shift

Recognizing the potential of DG to significantly influence diagnostic and prognostic models in cancer studies and clinical practice, we present this survey along with guidelines on achieving DG in CPath. We rigorously define various DS types, systematically review and categorize existing DG approaches and resources in CPath, and provide insights into their advantages, limitations, and applicability. We also conduct thorough benchmarking experiments with 28 cutting-edge DG algorithms to address a complex DG example problem. Our findings suggest that careful experiment design and Stain Augmentation technique can be very effective. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for DG in CPath. Therefore, we establish guidelines for detecting and managing DS in different scenarios. While most of the concepts and recommendations are given for applications in CPath, they apply to most medical image analysis tasks as well.},

  abstract = {Spatial dataflow architectures (SDAs) are a promising and versatile accelerator platform. They are software-programmable and achieve near-ASIC performance and energy efficiency, beating CPUs by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, many SDAs struggle to efficiently implement irregular computations because they suffer from an
            abstraction inversion
            : they fail to capture coarse-grain dataflow semantics in the application — namely asynchronous communication, pipelining, and queueing — that are naturally supported by the dataflow execution model and existing SDA hardware.
          
          
            Ripple is a language and architecture that corrects the abstraction inversion by preserving dataflow semantics down the stack. Ripple provides
            asynchronous iterators
            , shared-memory atomics, and a familiar task-parallel interface to concisely express the asynchronous pipeline parallelism enabled by an SDA. Ripple efficiently implements deadlock-free, asynchronous task communication by exposing hardware token queues in its ISA. Across nine important workloads, compared to a recent ordered-dataflow SDA, Ripple shrinks programs by 1.9×, improves performance by 3×, increases IPC by 58%, and reduces dynamic instructions by 44%.},

Although many efforts have been made to advance BPIQA from both conducting psychophysical experiments and designing performance-driven objective algorithms,

            and
            few samples

            , where we carefully design three types of experiments via investigating the gap between BPIQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA), the necessity of specific design in BPIQA models, and the generalization ability of BPIQA models. From extensive experiments, we find that easy databases narrow the gap between the performance of BPIQA and BIQA models, which is unconducive to the development of BPIQA. And the easy databases make the BPIQA models be closed to saturation; therefore, the effectiveness of the associated specific designs cannot be well verified. Besides, the BPIQA models trained on our recently proposed databases with complicated degradation show better generalization ability. Thus, we believe that much more efforts are highly desired to put into BPIQA from both subjective viewpoint and objective viewpoint.},

But to define a QCSP model, the alternation of quantifiers must be formerly known and cannot be built dynamically even if the worst case will not occur. To overcome this issue, the new QCHR formalism, that allows to generate quantifiers dynamically during the solving, is defined. QCHR models exhibit state-of-the-art performances on a priori fixed alternation of quantifiers and outperforms previous QCSP approaches when the generation of quantifiers is dynamic.},

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills
            via
            VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

We study the properties of the logic and provide automata-based mechanisms for deriving probabilistic inferences from its formulas. We then study a fragment of the logic with better computational properties. Notably, formulas in this fragment can be discovered from event log data using off-the-shelf existing declarative process discovery techniques.},

  abstract = {Primal logic arose in access control; it has a remarkably efficient (linear time) decision procedure for its entailment problem. But primal logic is a general logic of information. In the realm of arbitrary items of information (infons), conjunction, disjunction, and implication may seem to correspond (set-theoretically) to union, intersection, and relative complementation. But, while infons are closed under union, they are not closed under intersection or relative complementation. It turns out that there is a systematic transformation of propositional intuitionistic calculi to the original (propositional) primal calculi; we call it flatting. We extend flatting to quantifier rules, obtaining arguably the right quantified primal logic (QPL). The QPL entailment problem is exponential-time complete, but it is polynomial-time complete in the case, of importance to applications (at least to access control), where the number of quantifiers is bounded.},

Then, we design algorithms to solve the reachable simulation problem by leveraging the idea of interleaving reachability and simulation computation while possibly avoiding the computation of all the reachable states or the whole simulation preorder. Specifically, we propose algorithms achieving different guarantees on the precision of the output, and a symbolic algorithm that operates on state partitions and relations between their blocks, which is particularly well-suited for processing infinite-state systems.},

A key question is whether a given distribution policy for the reshuffle is adequate for computing a given query. This property is referred to as parallel-correctness. Another key problem is to detect whether the data reshuffle step can be avoided when evaluating subsequent queries. The latter problem is referred to as transfer of parallel-correctness. This article extends the study of parallel-correctness and transfer of parallel-correctness of conjunctive queries to incorporate bag semantics. We provide semantical characterizations for both problems, obtain complexity bounds, and discuss the relationship with their set semantics counterparts. Finally, we revisit both problems under a modified distribution model that takes advantage of a linear order on compute nodes and obtain tight complexity bounds.},

This is largely due to the rise of data-intensive applications, such as machine learning, online video distribution, astrophysics, and genomics. Moving compute operations closer to the data provides benefits in terms of scaling possibilities and energy efficiency. The development of computational storage devices has been limited by the need for specialized and complex hardware. In this work, we propose a portable Linux-based firmware framework for the development of NVMe computational storage devices. Our firmware runs on a variety of hardware platforms ranging from expensive FPGA solutions to inexpensive off-the-shelf single board computers. The firmware leverages the vast Linux software ecosystem to facilitate the development and prototyping of novel computational storage devices. We benchmark our firmware on multiple hardware platforms and demonstrate its versatility through several computational examples including a content-aware disk image search engine based on natural language processing and AI-driven image recognition.},

These systems can be thought as a generalization of architectures allowing information forks, that is, cases where strategic abilities lead to certain agents outside a coalition privately sharing information with selected agents inside that coalition. Moreover, in our case, in the initial states of the system, we allow information forks from agents outside a given set

Our findings lead to a number of design considerations for technologies that support adult children caring for parents who are aging in place, including: building common ground, establishing boundaries, addressing guilt, encouraging in-person communication, community support for adult children, and adapting to changes in role reciprocity.},

We refine our methods on small-scale webdata as a testbed and then generalize the interventions to a large-scale webgraph containing 93.9M domains and 1.6B edges. We demonstrate that our methods penalize unreliable domains far more than reliable domains in both settings and we explore multiple avenues to mitigate unintended effects on both the small-scale and large-scale webgraph experiments.

            One reason for this is that teaching “Formal Methods” is often confused with teaching logic and theory. This article advocates what we call
            FM thinking
            : the application of ideas from

            should be part of the recommended curriculum for every Computer Science student, for even students who train only in that “thinking” will become much better programmers. However, there will be others who, exposed to those ideas, will be ideally positioned to go further into the more theoretical background: why the techniques work, how they can be automated, and how new ones can be developed. Those students would follow subsequently a specialised, more theoretical stream, including topics such as semantics, logics, verification and proof-automation techniques.},

            , the hardware accelerator component for neoDBMS, a full-stack computational storage system designed to manage on-device execution of database queries/transactions as a Near-Data Processing (NDP)-operation. The proposed system enables Database Management Systems (DBMS) to offload NDP-operations to the storage while maintaining control over data through a

            .
            DANSEN

            the smart storage device while observing the DBMS concurrency control. Furthermore,
            DANSEN

            DANSEN
            storage prototype and interface on an UltraScale+HBM FPGA and fully integrated it with PostgreSQL 12. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NDP approach outperforms software-only PostgreSQL using a fast off-the-shelf NVMe drive and significantly improves the end-to-end execution time of an aggregation operation (similar to Q6 from CH-benCHmark, 150 million records) by ≈ 10.6×. The versatility of the proposed approach is also validated by integrating a compute-intensive data analytics application with multi-row results, outperforming PostgreSQL by ≈ 1.5×.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel model-theoretic framework inspired from graph modification and based on the interplay between model theory and algorithmic graph minors. The core of our framework is a new compound logic operating with two types of sentences, expressing graph modification: the
            modulator sentence
            , defining some property of the modified part of the graph, and the
            target sentence
            , defining some property of the resulting graph. In our framework, modulator sentences are in counting monadic second-order logic (
            CMSO
            ) and have models of bounded treewidth, while target sentences express first-order logic (
            FO
            ) properties. Our logic captures problems that are not definable in FO and, moreover, may have instances of unbounded treewidth. Our main result is that, for this compound logic, model-checking can be done in quadratic time on minor-free graphs. The proposed logic can be seen as a general framework to capitalize on the potential of the
            irrelevant vertex technique
            . It gives a way to deal with problem instances of unbounded treewidth, for which Courcelle’s theorem does not apply. The proof of our meta-theorem combines novel combinatorial results related to the Flat Wall theorem along with elements of the proof of Courcelle’s theorem and Gaifman’s theorem. Our algorithmic meta-theorem encompasses, unifies, and extends the known meta-algorithmic results for
            CMSO
            and
            FO
            on minor-closed graph classes.},

  abstract = {Computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, Google Colab) are widely used by data scientists. A key feature of notebooks is the interactive computing model of iteratively executing
            cells
            (i.e., a set of statements) and observing the result (e.g., model or plot). Unfortunately, existing notebook systems do not offer
            time-traveling to past states
            : when the user executes a cell, the notebook
            session state
            consisting of user-defined variables can be
            irreversibly modified
            —e.g., the user cannot 'un-drop' a dataframe column. This is because, unlike DBMS, existing notebook systems do not keep track of the session state. Existing techniques for checkpointing and restoring session states, such as OS-level memory snapshot or application-level session dump, are insufficient: checkpointing can incur prohibitive storage costs and may fail, while restoration can only be inefficiently performed from scratch by fully loading checkpoint files.
          
          
            In this paper, we introduce a new notebook system, Kishu, that offers time-traveling to and from arbitrary notebook states using an efficient and fault-tolerant incremental checkpoint and checkout mechanism. Kishu creates incremental checkpoints that are small and correctly preserve complex inter-variable dependencies at a novel
            Co-variable
            granularity. Then, to return to a previous state, Kishu accurately identifies the
            state difference
            between the current and target states to perform incremental checkout at sub-second latency with minimal data loading. Kishu is compatible with 146 object classes from popular data science libraries (e.g., Ray, Spark, PyTorch), and reduces checkpoint size and checkout time by up to 4.55× and 9.02×, respectively, on a variety of notebooks.},

To support effective design, inverse algorithms have been proposed that optimize the geometry of each element specifically for each design. This makes it difficult to reuse elements across designs or gain efficiency in fabrication through mass production.
          We address this issue and propose a computational framework to rationalize bending-active structures into a sparse kit of parts. Our method solves for the optimal part geometry such that multiple input designs can be faithfully realized with the same kit of parts. Assigning parts to different assemblies leads to a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive search intractable. Instead, we propose a relaxed continuous optimization incorporating a physics-based simulation in its inner loop to model the elastic deformation of the bending-active structure accurately. Our algorithm allows analyzing different design trade-offs of a kit of parts to tune the balance between fabrication complexity and fidelity to the original designs. We demonstrate our method on three different classes of bending-active structures, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach for part reuse and sustainable practices in fabrication-driven design.},

While progress has been made with communication skills training for clinicians, significant gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting. Advancements in ubiquitous technology and natural language processing make it possible to realize more objective, real-time assessment of clinical interactions and in turn provide more timely feedback to clinicians about their communication effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CommSense, a computational sensing framework that combines smartwatch audio and transcripts with natural language processing methods to measure selected "best-practice'' communication metrics captured by wearable devices in the context of palliative care interactions, including understanding, empathy, presence, emotion, and clarity. We conducted a pilot study involving N=40 clinician participants, to test the technical feasibility and acceptability of CommSense in a simulated clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that CommSense effectively captures most communication metrics and is well-received by both practicing clinicians and student trainees. Our study also highlights the potential for digital technology to enhance communication skills training for healthcare providers and students, ultimately resulting in more equitable delivery of healthcare and accessible, lower cost tools for training with the potential to improve patient outcomes.},

We discovered that in both feedback conditions the CA was perceived to be significantly more persuasive than in the baseline condition, while being perceived as significantly less confident. Interestingly, while unsolicited feedback was perceived as less appropriate than the baseline, both types of proactive feedback led participants to relisten and reconsider menu options significantly more often. Our results provide insights regarding the impact of proactive feedback on CA perception and user’s reflection in decision-making tasks, thereby paving a new way for designing proactive CAs.},

  abstract = {The width complexity measure plays a central role in resolution and other propositional proof systems like Polynomial Calculus (under the name of degree). The study of width lower bounds is the most used method for proving size lower bounds, and it is known that for the mentioned proof systems, proofs with small width also imply the existence of proofs with small size. Not much has been studied, however, about the width parameter in the cutting planes (CP) proof system, a measure that was introduced by Dantchev and Martin in 2009 under the name of CP cutwidth.
          
            In this article, we study the width complexity of CP refutations of graph isomorphism formulas. For a pair of non-isomorphic graphs

            of the graphs and the width of a CP refutation for the corresponding isomorphism formula
            
              \(\mathrm{Iso}(G,H)\)
            
            . In particular, we show that if

We also obtain polynomial-length CP refutations from our width bound for isomorphism formulas for graphs with constant Weisfeiler–Leman dimension. Furthermore, we notice that a length lower bound for refuting graph isomorphism formulas in the subsystem of tree-like cutting planes with polynomially bounded coefficients follows from known results.},

State variables can be functions from an uninterpreted sort (finite but unbounded) to an interpreted sort, such as the integers under the theory of linear arithmetic. This formalism is very expressive and can be used for modeling parameterized systems, array-manipulating programs, and more. We propose two algorithms for finding universal inductive invariants for such systems. The first algorithm combines an IC3-style loop with a form of implicit predicate abstraction to construct an invariant in an incremental manner. The second algorithm constructs an under-approximation of the original problem and searches for a formula which is an inductive invariant for this case; then, the invariant is generalized to the original case and checked with a portfolio of techniques. We have implemented the two algorithms and conducted an extensive experimental evaluation, considering various benchmarks and different tools from the literature. As far as we know, our method is the first capable of handling in a large class of systems in a uniform way. The experiment shows that both algorithms are competitive with the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Event structures have emerged as a foundational model for concurrent computation, explaining computational processes by outlining the events and the relationships that dictate their execution. They play a pivotal role in the study of key aspects of concurrent computation models, such as causality and independence, and have found applications across a broad range of languages and models, spanning realms like persistence, probabilities, and quantum computing. Recently, event structures have been extended to address reversibility, where computational processes can undo previous computations. In this context, reversible event structures provide abstract representations of processes capable of both forward and backward steps in a computation. Since their introduction, event structures have played a crucial role in bridging operational models, traditionally exemplified by Petri nets and process calculi, with denotational ones, i.e., algebraic domains. In this context, we revisit the standard connection between Petri nets and event structures under the lenses of reversibility. Specifically, we introduce a subset of contextual Petri nets, dubbed
            reversible causal nets
            , that precisely correspond to reversible prime event structures. The distinctive feature of reversible causal nets lies in deriving causality from inhibitor arcs, departing from the conventional dependence on the overlap between the postset and preset of transitions. In this way, we are able to operationally explain the full model of reversible prime event structures.},

Based on the main result, we generalize a sufficient condition for identifying hard problems for LP and give a separation map for an LP family from a computational point of view, whose members are all equally expressive and share the same reasoning complexity.},

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.},

Our approach utilizes the interaction between a CDCL SAT solver and a special symmetry propagator where the SAT solver runs on an encoding of the desired graph property. The symmetry propagator checks partially generated graphs for minimality with respect to a lexicographic ordering during the solving process. This approach has several advantages over a static symmetry breaking: (i) symmetries are detected early in the generation process, (ii) symmetry breaking is seamlessly integrated into the CDCL procedure, and (iii) the propagator performs a complete symmetry breaking without causing a prohibitively large initial encoding. We instantiate our approach by generating extremal graphs with certain restrictions in terms of forbidden subgraphs and diameter. In particular, we could confirm the Murty–Simon Conjecture (1979) on diameter-2-critical graphs for graphs up to 19 vertices and prove the exact number of Ramsey graphs

This paper establishes a foundation for exploring illusion knitting in the context of computational design and fabrication. We observe that the design space is highly constrained, elucidate these constraints, and derive strategies for developing effective, machine-knittable illusion patterns. We partially automate these strategies in a new interactive design tool that reduces difficult patterning tasks to familiar image editing tasks. Illusion patterns also uncover new fabrication challenges regarding mixed colorwork and texture; we describe new algorithms for mitigating fabrication failures and ensuring high-quality knit results.},

  abstract = {Surface-based inflatables are composed of two thin layers of nearly inextensible sheet material joined together along carefully selected fusing curves. During inflation, pressure forces separate the two sheets to maximize the enclosed volume. The fusing curves restrict this expansion, leading to a spatially varying in-plane contraction and hence metric frustration. The inflated structure settles into a 3D equilibrium that balances pressure forces with the internal elastic forces of the sheets.
          We present a computational framework for analyzing and designing surface-based inflatable structures with arbitrary fusing patterns. Our approach employs numerical homogenization to characterize the behavior of parametric families of periodic inflatable patch geometries, which can then be combined to tessellate the sheet with smoothly varying patterns. We propose a novel parametrization of the underlying deformation space that allows accurate, efficient, and systematical analysis of the stretching and bending behavior of inflated patches with potentially open boundaries.
          We apply our homogenization algorithm to create a database of geometrically diverse fusing patterns spanning a wide range of material properties and deformation characteristics. This database is employed in an inverse design algorithm that solves for fusing curves to best approximate a given input target surface. Local patches are selected and blended to form a global network of curves based on a geometric flattening algorithm. These fusing curves are then further optimized to minimize the distance of the deployed structure to target surface. We show that this approach offers greater flexibility to approximate given target geometries compared to previous work while significantly improving structural performance.},

  abstract = {While conventional cameras offer versatility for applications ranging from amateur photography to autonomous driving, computational cameras allow for domain-specific adaption. Cameras with co-designed optics and image processing algorithms enable high-dynamic-range image recovery, depth estimation, and hyperspectral imaging through optically encoding scene information that is otherwise undetected by conventional cameras. However, this optical encoding creates a challenging inverse reconstruction problem for conventional image recovery, and often lowers the overall photographic quality. Thus computational cameras with domain-specific optics have only been adopted in a few specialized applications where the captured information cannot be acquired in other ways. In this work, we investigate a method that combines two optical systems into one to tackle this challenge. We split the aperture of a conventional camera into two halves: one which applies an application-specific modulation to the incident light via a diffractive optical element to produce a coded image capture, and one which applies no modulation to produce a conventional image capture. Co-designing the phase modulation of the split aperture with a dual-pixel sensor allows us to simultaneously capture these coded and uncoded images without increasing physical or computational footprint. With an uncoded conventional image alongside the optically coded image in hand, we investigate image reconstruction methods that are conditioned on the conventional image, making it possible to eliminate artifacts and compute costs that existing methods struggle with. We assess the proposed method with 2-in-1 cameras for optical high-dynamic-range reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, and hyperspectral imaging, comparing favorably to all tested methods in all applications.},

One long-standing question that arises in this and other testing contexts is as follows: When can we stop testing? At what point can we be certain that executing further tests in this manner will not explore previously untested (and potentially buggy) software behaviors? This is analogous to the question in Machine Learning, of how many training examples are required in order to infer an accurate model. In this paper we show how probabilistic approaches to answer this question in Machine Learning (arising from Computational Learning Theory) can be applied in our testing context. This enables us to produce an upper bound on the number of tests that are required to achieve a given level of adequacy. We are the first to enable this from only knowing the number of coverage targets (e.g. lines of code) in the source code, without needing to observe a sample test executions. We validate this bound on a large set of Java units, and an autonomous driving system.},

Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have not yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial domains, including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality, such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, the task-agnostic large learning models (LLMs) can outperform task-specific fully supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image–based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing FMs still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing an FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodal nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal FM that can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this article by discussing the unique risks and challenges to developing such a model for GeoAI.},

  abstract = {Time series data are widely used and provide a wealth of information for countless applications. However, some applications are faced with a limited amount of data, or the data cannot be used due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these obstacles, time series can be generated synthetically. For example, electrocardiograms can be synthesized to make them available for building models to predict conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia without leaking patient information. Although many different approaches to time series synthesis have been proposed, evaluating the quality of synthetic time series data poses unique challenges and remains an open problem, as there is a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a “good” synthesis. To this end, we present a comprehensive literature survey to identify different aspects of synthesis quality and their relationships. Based on this, we propose a definition of synthesis quality and a systematic evaluation procedure for assessing it. With this work, we aim to provide a common language and criteria for evaluating synthetic time series data. Our goal is to promote more rigorous and reproducible research in time series synthesis by enabling researchers and practitioners to generate high-quality synthetic time series data.},

          Dr. Siddartha Jayanti's thesis comprises novel results in the scope of distributed and concurrent synchronization. The thesis, and Siddartha's work in general, is remarkable for both its depth and breadth: as you can see in the overview, the work incorporates technical results spanning from multi-processor synchronization to finding equilibria in multiplayer games! Another remarkable aspect is Siddartha's commitment to broadening participation in STEM, specifically to expanding science availability by writing what appears to be the first research paper in the Telugu language. It is also worth noting that Siddartha is part of the second generation of Distributed Computing researchers from his family. (As readers probably know, his father is Prof. Prasad Jayanti.)

The player also incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., when they increase or decrease their purchasing amount. We introduce competitive (robust) threshold-based algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem, and show they are optimal among deterministic online algorithms. We then propose learning-augmented algorithms that take advantage of untrusted black-box advice (such as predictions from a machine learning model) to achieve significantly better average-case performance without sacrificing worst-case competitive guarantees. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms using a carbon-aware EV charging case study, showing that our algorithms substantially improve on baseline methods for this problem.},

  abstract = {Microarchitecture simulators are indispensable tools for microarchitecture designers to validate, estimate, and optimize new hardware that meets specific design requirements. While the quest for a fast, accurate and detailed microarchitecture simulation has been ongoing for decades, existing simulators excel and fall short at different aspects: (i) Although execution-driven simulation is accurate and detailed, it is extremely slow and requires expert-level experience to design. (ii) Trace-driven simulation reuses the execution traces in pursuit of fast simulation but faces accuracy concerns and fails to achieve significant speedup. (iii) Emerging deep learning (DL)-based simulations are remarkably fast and have acceptable accuracy, but introduce substantial overheads from trace regeneration and model re-training when simulating a new microarchitecture.
          Re-thinking the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned three mainstream simulation paradigms, this paper introduces TAO that redesigns the DL-based simulation with three primary contributions: First, we propose a new training dataset design such that the subsequent simulation (i.e., inference) only needs functional trace as inputs, which can be rapidly generated and reused across microarchitectures. Second, to increase the detail of the simulation, we redesign the input features and the DL model using self-attention to support predicting various performance metrics of interest. Third, we propose techniques to train a microarchitecture agnostic embedding layer that enables fast transfer learning between different microarchitectural configurations and effectively reduces the re-training overhead of conventional DL-based simulators. TAO can predict various performance metrics of interest, significantly reduce the simulation time, and maintain similar simulation accuracy as state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors.},

It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms. Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introduce double-threshold algorithms for both variants of this problem. We further show that the competitive ratios achieved by these algorithms are the best achievable by any deterministic online algorithm. Finally, we empirically validate our proposed algorithm through case studies on the application of carbon-aware load shifting using real carbon trace data and existing baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {Differentiable rendering methods promise the ability to optimize various parameters of three-dimensional (3D) scenes to achieve a desired result. However, lighting design has so far received little attention in this field. In this article, we introduce a method that enables continuous optimization of the arrangement of luminaires in a 3D scene via differentiable light tracing. Our experiments show two major issues when attempting to apply existing methods from differentiable path tracing to this problem: First, many rendering methods produce images, which restricts the ability of a designer to define lighting objectives to image space. Second, most previous methods are designed for scene geometry or material optimization and have not been extensively tested for the case of optimizing light sources. Currently available differentiable ray-tracing methods do not provide satisfactory performance, even on fairly basic test cases in our experience. In this article, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, a novel adjoint light tracing method that overcomes these challenges and enables gradient-based lighting design optimization in a view-independent (camera-free) way. Thus, we allow the user to paint illumination targets directly onto the 3D scene or use existing baked illumination data (e.g., light maps). Using modern ray-tracing hardware, we achieve interactive performance. We find light tracing advantageous over path tracing in this setting, as it naturally handles irregular geometry, resulting in less noise and improved optimization convergence. We compare our adjoint gradients to state-of-the-art image-based differentiable rendering methods. We also demonstrate that our gradient data works with various common optimization algorithms, providing good convergence behaviour. Qualitative comparisons with real-world scenes underline the practical applicability of our method.},

  abstract = {Microarchitecture simulators are indispensable tools for microarchitecture designers to validate, estimate, optimize, and manufacture new hardware that meets specific design requirements. While the quest for a fast, accurate and detailed microarchitecture simulation has been ongoing for decades, existing simulators excel and fall short at different aspects: (i) Although execution-driven simulation is accurate and detailed, it is extremely slow and requires expert-level experience to design. (ii) Trace-driven simulation reuses the execution traces in pursuit of fast simulation but faces accuracy concerns and fails to achieve significant speedup. (iii) Emerging deep learning (DL)-based simulations are remarkably fast and have acceptable accuracy, but fail to provide adequate low-level microarchitectural performance metrics such as branch mispredictions or cache misses, which is crucial for microarchitectural bottleneck analysis. Additionally, they introduce substantial overheads from trace regeneration and model re-training when simulating a new microarchitecture.
          Re-thinking the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned three mainstream simulation paradigms, this paper introduces TAO that redesigns the DL-based simulation with three primary contributions: First, we propose a new training dataset design such that the subsequent simulation (i.e., inference) only needs functional trace as inputs, which can be rapidly generated and reused across microarchitectures. Second, to increase the detail of the simulation, we redesign the input features and the DL model using self-attention to support predicting various performance metrics of interest. Third, we propose techniques to train a microarchitecture agnostic embedding layer that enables fast transfer learning between different microarchitectural configurations and effectively reduces the re-training overhead of conventional DL-based simulators. TAO can predict various performance metrics of interest, significantly reduce the simulation time, and maintain similar simulation accuracy as state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors. Our extensive evaluation shows TAO can reduce the overall training and simulation time by 18.06x over the state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors.},

CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

We present Outcome Separation Logic (OSL), a program logic that is sound for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning in programs with varying effects. OSL has a frame rule—just like separation logic—but uses different underlying assumptions that open up local reasoning to a larger class of properties than can be handled by any single existing logic.Building on this foundational theory, we also define symbolic execution algorithms that use bi-abduction to derive specifications for programs with effects. This involves a newtri-abductionprocedure to analyze programs whose execution branches due to effects such as nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. This work furthers the compositionality promised by separation logic by opening up the possibility for greater reuse of analysis tools across two dimensions: bug-finding vs verification in programs with varying effects.},

Our findings highlight central considerations around science journalists' user agency, contexts of use, and professional responsibility that such tools can influence and could account for in design.

  abstract = {Border Theory suggests individuals create borders to manage the transitions between work and family (or, more generally, life) domains. The degree of separation or integration of domains across borders has an impact on the balance between work and life. Previous studies have shown individuals who perceive balance between work and life domains tend to be more satisfied with their lives, reporting higher physical and mental health. At times of crisis, such as during a pandemic, borders can be disrupted, affecting work-life balance and leading to a short- or long-term negative impact on well-being. Border theory provides a systematic lens through which to study these changes. However, changes cannot be studied using interviews or diaries as these are not at the scale required when societal disruptions occur. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a computational linguistic approach to operationalize border theory at scale, using readily available social media data. In particular, we make two main contributions. First, we design metrics to measure key characteristics of borders. This involves the application of a transformer-based topic modeling technique, BERTopic, to detect topics from social media data. Second, we apply this operationalization to a case study of around a million tweets posted by nearly two hundred teachers and journalists in the UK from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2022. In so doing, we longitudinally study and compare the changes in borders between work and life before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown periods.},

  abstract = {Undoing computations of a concurrent system is beneficial in many situations, such as in reversible debugging of multi-threaded programs and in recovery from errors due to optimistic execution in parallel discrete event simulation. A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation, including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, and abstract models such as prime event structures and occurrence nets. However, it has not been settled as to what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between various reversibility properties. In particular, we show how all properties we consider are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism, it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new properties related to causal-consistent reversibility, namely causal liveness and causal safety, stating, respectively, that an action can be undone if (causal liveness) and only if (causal safety) it is independent from all of the following actions. These properties come in three flavours: defined in terms of independent transitions, independent events, or via an ordering on events. Both causal liveness and causal safety are derivable from our axioms.},

We first investigate preservation of equivalences and satisfiability of formulas between finite and infinite traces, by providing a set of semantic and syntactic conditions to guarantee when the distinction between reasoning in the two cases can be blurred. Moreover, we show that the satisfiability problem on finite traces for several decidable fragments of first-order temporal logic is

A finite characterisation of a modal formula φ is a finite collection of positive and negative examples that distinguishes φ from every other, non-equivalent modal formula, where an example is a finite pointed Kripke structure. This definition can be restricted to specific frame classes and to fragments of the modal language: a modal fragment ℒ admits finite characterisations with respect to a frame class ℱ if every formula φ ∈ ℒ has a finite characterisation with respect to ℒ consisting of examples that are based on frames in ℱ. Finite characterisations are useful for illustration, interactive specification and debugging of formal specifications, and their existence is a precondition for exact learnability with membership queries. We show that the full modal language admits finite characterisations with respect to a frame class ℱ only when the modal logic of ℱ is locally tabular. We then study which modal fragments, freely generated by some set of connectives, admit finite characterisations. Our main result is that the positive modal language without the truth-constants ⊤ and ⊥ admits finite characterisations w.r.t. the class of all frames. This result is essentially optimal: finite characterisability fails when the language is extended with the truth constant ⊤ or ⊥ or with all but very limited forms of negation.},

In this context, after responding with his strategy, Player 1 gets a payoff in the form of a vector of Booleans corresponding to his satisfied objectives. Rationality of Player 1 is encoded by the fact that his response must produce a Pareto-optimal payoff given the strategy of Player 0. We study for several kinds of ω-regular objectives the Stackelberg-Pareto Synthesis problem which asks whether Player 0 can announce a strategy which satisfies his objective, whatever the rational response of Player 1.

One of the main reasons for I/O imbalances is the lack of a global view of system-wide resource consumption. While approaches to address the problem already exist, the diversity of HPC workloads combined with different file striping patterns prevents widespread adoption of these approaches. In addition, load-balancing techniques should be transparent to client applications. To address these issues, we propose
            Tarazu
            , an end-to-end control plane where clients transparently and adaptively write to a set of selected I/O servers to achieve balanced data placement. Our control plane leverages real-time load statistics for global data placement on distributed storage servers, while our design model employs trace-based optimization techniques to minimize latency for I/O load requests between clients and servers and to handle multiple striping patterns in files. We evaluate our proposed system on an experimental cluster for two common use cases: the synthetic I/O benchmark IOR and the scientific application I/O kernel HACC-I/O. We also use a discrete-time simulator with real HPC application traces from emerging workloads running on the Summit supercomputer to validate the effectiveness and scalability of
            Tarazu
            in large-scale storage environments. The results show improvements in load balancing and read performance of up to 33% and 43%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.},

            ∘
            images) have more complicated perceptual characteristics due to the particularities of imaging and display. How humans perceive omnidirectional images in an immersive environment and form the immersive quality of experience are important problems. Thus, it is crucial to measure the quality of omnidirectional images under different viewing conditions, which suffer from realistic distortions. In this article, we build a large-scale subjective assessment database for omnidirectional images and carry out a comprehensive psychophysical experiment to study the relationships between different factors (viewing conditions and viewing behaviors) and the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images. In addition, we collect both subjective ratings and head movement data. A thorough analysis of the collected subjective data is also provided, where we make several interesting findings. Moreover, with the proposed database, we propose a novel transformer-based omnidirectional image quality assessment model. To be consistent with the human viewing process, viewing conditions and behaviors are naturally incorporated into the proposed model. Specifically, the proposed model mainly consists of three parts: viewport sequence generation, multi-scale feature extraction, and perceptual quality prediction. Extensive experimental results conducted on the proposed database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing image quality assessment methods.},

Covert behaviors, such as trolling, are especially challenging to detect automatically, because they utilize deceptive strategies to manipulate conversation. We illustrate a novel approach to their detection: analyzing conversational structures instead of focusing only on messages in isolation. Building on conversation analysis, we demonstrate that (1) conversational actions and their norms provide concepts for a deeper understanding of covert disruption, and that (2) machine learning, natural language processing and structural analysis of conversation can complement message-level features to create models that surpass earlier approaches to trolling detection. Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies’ message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively). The findings offer a theoretically grounded approach to computationally analyzing social media interaction and novel methods for effectively detecting covert disruptive conversations online.},

A perspective strategy for a player depends only on the history of visits in her vertices. Thus, unlike observation-based models of partial visibility, where uncertainty is longitudinal—players partially observe all vertices in the history, uncertainty in the perspective model is transverse—players fully observe part of the vertices in the history.

            Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?
          
          
            Method.
            This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.
          
          
            Participants.
            Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.
          
          
            Findings.
            Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.
          
          
            Implications.
            Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

  abstract = {Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of smart wearable devices. However, variations in different subjects can cause a domain shift that impedes the scaling of the recognition model. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to recognize activities in new, unlabeled target domains by training the source and target data together. However, the need for accessing source data raises privacy concerns. Source-free domain adaptation has emerged as a practical setting, where only a pre-trained source model is provided for the unlabeled target domain. This setup aligns with the need for personalized activity model adaptation on target local devices. As the edge devices are resource-constrained with limited memory, it is crucial to take the computational efficiency, i.e., memory cost into consideration. In this paper, we develop a source-free domain adaptation framework for wearable sensor-based HAR, with a focus on computational efficiency for target edge devices. Firstly, we design a lightweight add-on module called adapter to adapt the frozen pre-trained model to the unlabeled target domain. Secondly, to optimize the adapter, we adopt a simple yet effective model adaptation method that leverages local representation similarity and prediction consistency. Additionally, we design a set of sample selection optimization strategies to select samples effective for adaptation and further enhance computational efficiency while maintaining adaptation performance. Our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the state-of-the-art source free domain adaptation methods with fewer than 1% of the parameters updated and saves up to 4.99X memory cost.},

  abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.
          It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.
          In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

Secure computation outsourcing (SCO) presents a viable solution by safeguarding the confidentiality of inputs and outputs in data processing without disclosure. Nonetheless, this approach assumes the existence of a trustworthy coordinator to orchestrate and oversee the process, typically implying that data owners must fulfill this role themselves. In this paper, we consider secure delegated data processing (SDDP), an expanded data processing scenario wherein data owners simply delegate their data to SDDP providers for subsequent value mining or other downstream applications, eliminating the necessary involvement of data owners or trusted entities to dive into data processing deeply. However, general-purpose SDDP poses significant challenges in permitting the discretionary execution of computational tasks by SDDP providers on sensitive data while ensuring confidentiality. Existing approaches are insufficient to support SDDP in either efficiency or universality. To tackle this issue, we propose TGCB, a TEE-based General-purpose Computational Backend, designed to endow general-purpose computation with SDDP capabilities from an engineering perspective, powered by TEE-based code integrity and data confidentiality. Central to TGCB is the Encryption Programming Language (EPL) that defines computational tasks in SDDP. Specifically, SDDP providers can express arbitrary computable functions as EPL scripts, processed by TGCB's interfaces, securely interpreted and executed in TEE, ensuring data confidentiality throughout the process. As a universal computational backend, TGCB extensively bolsters data security in existing general-purpose computational tasks, allowing data owners to leverage SDDP without privacy concerns.},

A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media?
          In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns.},

In this problem, a player attempts to find the k lowest (alternatively, highest) prices in a sequence of fixed length T, which is revealed sequentially. At each time step, the player is presented with a price and decides whether to accept or reject it. The player incurs aswitching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., whenever they pause or resume purchasing. This online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms. Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introducedouble-threshold algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem. We further show that the competitive ratios achieved by these algorithms are the best achievable by any deterministic online algorithm. Finally, we empirically validate our proposed algorithm through case studies on the application of carbon-aware load shifting using real carbon trace data and existing baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials enable customizing the elastic properties of physical objects by altering their fine-scale structure. A broad gamut of effective material properties can be produced even from a single fabrication material by optimizing the geometry of a periodic microstructure tiling. Past work has extensively studied the capabilities of microstructures in the small-displacement regime, where periodic homogenization of linear elasticity yields computationally efficient optimal design algorithms. However, many applications involve flexible structures undergoing large deformations for which the accuracy of linear elasticity rapidly deteriorates due to geometric nonlinearities. Design of microstructures at finite strains involves a massive increase in computation and is much less explored; no computational tool yet exists to design metamaterials emulating target hyperelastic laws
            over finite regions of strain space.
          
          We make an initial step in this direction, developing algorithms to accelerate homogenization and metamaterial design for nonlinear elasticity and building a complete framework for the optimal design of planar metamaterials. Our nonlinear homogenization method works by efficiently constructing an accurate interpolant of a microstructure's deformation over a finite space of macroscopic strains likely to be endured by the metamaterial. From this interpolant, the homogenized energy density, stress, and tangent elasticity tensor describing the microstructure's effective properties can be inexpensively computed at any strain. Our design tool then fits the effective material properties to a target constitutive law over a region of strain space using a parametric shape optimization approach, producing a directly manufacturable geometry. We systematically test our framework by designing a catalog of materials fitting isotropic Hooke's laws as closely as possible. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy over traditional linear metamaterial design techniques by fabricating and testing physical prototypes.},

Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this article, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyze its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.},

There are many instances of the introduced imprecise components of different types, while their main difference is that they propose different precision-cost-performance trade-offs. In this paper, a novel comprehensive model for the imprecise components is introduced, which can be exploited to cover a wide range of precision-cost-performance trade-offs, for different types of imprecise components. The model helps to find the suitable imprecise component based on any desired error criterion. Therefore, the most significant advantage of the proposed model is that it can be simply exploited for design space exploration of different imprecise components to extract the suitable components, with the desired precision-cost-performance trade-off for any specific application. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, two novel families of Lowest-cost Imprecise Adders (LIAs) and Lowest-cost Imprecise Multipliers (LIMs) are introduced in the paper, which are systematically extracted based on exploration of the design space provided by the proposed model. A wide range of simulation and synthesis results are also presented in the paper to prove the comparable efficiency of the systematically extracted LIA/LIM structures with respect to the most efficient existing human-made imprecise components both individually and in a Multiply-Accumulate application.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

We present BlendMR, an optimization-based MR system that blends virtual content onto the physical objects in users’ environments to serve as ambient information displays. Our approach takes existing 2D applications and meshes of physical objects as input. It analyses the geometry of the physical objects and identifies regions that are suitable hosts for virtual elements. Using a novel integer programming formulation, our approach then optimally maps selected contents of the 2D applications onto the object, optimizing for factors such as importance and hierarchy of information, viewing angle, and geometric distortion. We evaluate BlendMR by comparing it to a 2D window baseline. Study results show that BlendMR decreases clutter and distraction, and is preferred by users. We demonstrate the applicability of BlendMR in a series of results and usage scenarios.},

  abstract = {Computational modeling has become a widespread approach for studying real-world phenomena by using different modeling perspectives, in particular, the microscopic point of view concentrates on the behavior of the single components and their interactions from which the global system evolution emerges, while the macroscopic point of view represents the system’s overall behavior abstracting as much as possible from that of the single components. The preferred point of view depends on the effort required to develop the model, on the detail level of the available information about the system to be modeled, and on the type of measures that are of interest to the modeler; each point of view may lead to a different modeling language and simulation paradigm. An approach adequate for the microscopic point of view is Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation, which has gained popularity in the last few decades but lacks a formal definition common to the different tools supporting it. This may lead to modeling mistakes and wrong interpretation of the results, especially when comparing models of the same system developed according to different points of view. The aim of the work described in this paper is to provide a common compositional modeling language from which both a macro and a micro simulation model can be automatically derived: these models are coherent by construction and may be studied through different simulation approaches and tools. A framework is thus proposed in which a model can be composed using a Petri Net formalism and then studied through both an Agent-Based Simulation and a classical Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, depending on the study goal.},

The projective Beth definability property (PBDP) states that an explicit definition exists iff a formula stating implicit definability is valid. Thus, the CIP and PBDP reduce potentially hard existence problems to entailment in the underlying logic. Description (and modal) logics with nominals and/or role inclusions do not enjoy the CIP nor the PBDP, but interpolants and explicit definitions have many applications, in particular in concept learning, ontology engineering, and ontology-based data management. In this article, we show that, even without Beth and Craig, the existence of interpolants and explicit definitions is decidable in description logics with nominals and/or role inclusions such as 𝒜ℒ𝒞𝒪, 𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋ, and 𝒜ℒ𝒞ℋ𝒪ℐ and corresponding hybrid modal logics. However, living without Beth and Craig makes these problems harder than entailment: the existence problems become
            2ExpTime
            -complete in the presence of an ontology or the universal modality, and
            coNExpTime
            -complete otherwise. We also analyze explicit definition existence if all symbols (except the one that is defined) are admitted in the definition. In this case, the complexity depends on whether one considers individual or concept names. Finally, we consider the problem of computing interpolants and explicit definitions if they exist and turn the complexity upper bound proof into an algorithm computing them, at least for description logics with role inclusions.},

            cells
            (i.e., a set of statements) to create variables, train models, visualize results, etc. Unfortunately, existing notebook systems do not offer live migration: when a notebook launches on a new machine, it loses its
            state
            , preventing users from continuing their tasks from where they had left off. This is because, unlike DBMS, the sessions directly rely on underlying kernels (e.g., Python/R interpreters) without an additional data management layer. Existing techniques for preserving states, such as copying all variables or OS-level checkpointing, are unreliable (often fail), inefficient, and platform-dependent. Also, re-running code from scratch can be highly time-consuming.
          
          
            In this paper, we introduce a new notebook system, Elastic-Notebook, that offers live migration via checkpointing/restoration using a novel mechanism that is reliable, efficient, and platform-independent. Specifically, by observing all cell executions via transparent, lightweight monitoring, ElasticNotebook can find a reliable and efficient way (i.e.,
            replication plan
            ) for reconstructing the original session state, considering variable-cell dependencies, observed runtime, variable sizes, etc. To this end, our new graph-based optimization problem finds how to reconstruct all variables (efficiently) from a subset of variables that can be transferred across machines. We show that ElasticNotebook reduces end-to-end migration and restoration times by 85%-98% and 94%-99%, respectively, on a variety (i.e., Kaggle, JWST, and Tutorial) of notebooks with negligible runtime and memory overheads of &lt;2.5% and &lt;10%.},

  abstract = {Just as other disciplines, the humanities explore how computational research approaches and tools can meaningfully contribute to scholarly knowledge production. Building on related work from the areas of CSCW and HCI, we approach the design of computational tools through the analytical lens of 'human-AI collaboration.' Such work investigates how human competencies and computational capabilities can be effectively and meaningfully combined. However, there is no generalizable concept of what constitutes 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration. In terms of genuinely human competencies, we consider criticality and reflection as guiding principles of scholarly knowledge production and as deeply embedded in the methodologies and practices of the humanities. Although (designing for) reflection is a recurring topic in CSCW and HCI discourses, it has not been centered in work on human-AI collaboration. We posit that integrating both concepts is a viable approach to supporting 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in the humanities and other qualitative, interpretivist, and hermeneutic research areas. Our research, thus, is guided by the question of how critical reflection can be enabled in human-AI collaboration. We address this question with a use case that centers on computer vision (CV) tools for art historical image retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a qualitative interview study with art historians to explore a) what potentials and affordances art historians ascribe to human-AI collaboration and CV in particular, and b) in what ways art historians conceptualize critical reflection in the context of human-AI collaboration. We extended the interviews with a think-aloud software exploration. We observed and recorded participants' interaction with a ready-to-use CV tool in a possible research scenario. We found that critical reflection, indeed, constitutes a core prerequisite for 'meaningful' human-AI collaboration in humanities research contexts. However, we observed that critical reflection was not fully realized during interaction with the CV tool. We interpret this divergence as supporting our hypothesis that computational tools need to be intentionally designed in such a way that they actively scaffold and support critical reflection during interaction. Based on our findings, we suggest four empirically grounded design implications for 'critical-reflective human-AI collaboration': supporting reflection on the basis of transparency, foregrounding epistemic presumptions, emphasizing the situatedness of data, and strengthening interpretability through contextualized explanations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines craft's foundational relations to materials, techniques, and collaborative modes of teaching and learning, and these can be called upon to strengthen and extend computational craft as practiced in fields like CSCW and HCI. Drawing from literature in HCI, craft studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), we explore craft's modern formation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution across three formative sites: Scandinavian Slöyd, British Arts and Crafts, and Japanese Mingei. From this review we identify three key (and still evolving) features: craft's accountabilities to natural materials and local ecologies; craft's holistic ways of making with 'head, heart, and hand'; and craft's distinctly collaborative and embodied styles of teaching and learning. We then show how these lessons can be applied to contemporary practices and pedagogies of computational making. We argue that doing so can help to rebalance computation's ecological ties and relations, recenter its practice on a sensorially rich and 'whole-self' concept of making, and support more collaborative modes of teaching and learning that are inclusive, relational, and heterogeneous.},

  abstract = {Despite the benefits of expert interaction techniques, many users do not learn them and continue to use novice ones. This article aims at better understanding if, when and how users decide to learn and ultimately adopt expert interaction techniques. This dynamic learning process is a complex skill-acquisition and decision-making problem. We first present and compare three generic benchmark models, inspired by the neuroscience literature, to explain and predict the learning process for shortcut adoption. Results show that they do not account for the complexity of users’ behavior. We then introduce a dedicated model, Transition, combining five cognitive mechanisms: implicit and explicit learning, decay, planning and perseveration. Results show that our model outperforms the three benchmark models both in terms of model fitting and model simulation. Finally, a post-analysis shows that each of the five mechanisms contribute to goodness-of-fit, but the role of perseveration is unclear regarding model simulation.},

Grounded in a chronology of the development of Webstrates and Codestrates, we present eight tensions that we needed to balance during their development. We use these tensions as an analytical lens in three case studies and a game challenge in which participants created games using Codestrates. We discuss the results of the game challenge based on these tensions and present key takeaways for six of them. Finally, we present six lessons learned from our endeavor to realize the vision of computational media, demonstrating the balancing act of weighing the vision against the pragmatics of implementing a working system.},

The findings assess the issues with IPE transformation and development in colleges and universities and suggest solutions, as well as four mechanisms of "methodical design underlined in the overview, team-work cooperation of team development, augmentation of environmental development, and double endorsement of quality management”. The concept of developing a” three-stage full atmosphere" network IPE architecture for universities and colleges is presented as one of the remedies to enhance the efficiency of the IPE in universities. This idea is based on experience summary, theoretical analysis, and empirical study. The timeliness concerns of IPE transformation in universities and colleges are resolved by using in-depth comprehension and evaluation of the necessary knowledge of DM-AI, which is then used to apply the appropriate DM-AI methodologies. This allows the relevant administrators to quickly learn the crucial data in complicated problems and suggest solutions for subsequent decision-making.},

  abstract = {Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies.
          
            In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the
            Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive
            and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.},

Because the structures’ “architectures” vary widely—with elements such as beams, thin shells, and solid bulks—it is difficult to explore them using existing representations. Generic approaches like voxel grids are versatile, but it is cumbersome to represent and edit individual structures; architecture-specific approaches address these issues, but are incompatible with one another. By contrast, our procedural graph succinctly represents the construction process for any structure using a simple skeleton annotated with spatially varying thickness. To express the highly constrained

            in this manner, we present the first fully automated version of the conjugate surface construction method, which allows novices to create complex TPMS from intuitive input.

We also conduct a user study to verify our representation’s ease-of-use and ability to expand engineers’ capacity for exploration.},

When endowed with the material thickness and bending resistance of a physical wire, these knots settle into equilibrium states that balance the forces induced by elastic deformation and self-contacts of the wire. In general, elastic knots can have many distinct equilibrium states, i.e. they are
            multistable
            mechanical systems. We propose a computational pipeline that combines randomized spatial sampling and physics simulation to efficiently find stable equilibrium states of elastic knots. Leveraging results from knot theory, we run our pipeline on thousands of different topological knot types to create an extensive data set of multistable knots. By applying a series of filters to this data, we discover new transformable knots with interesting geometric and physical properties. A further analysis across knot types reveals geometric and topological patterns, yielding constructive principles that generalize beyond the currently tabulated knot types. We show how multistable elastic knots can be used to design novel deployable structures and engaging recreational puzzles. Several physical prototypes at different scales highlight these applications and validate our simulation.},

  abstract = {Long exposure photography produces stunning imagery, representing moving elements in a scene with motion-blur. It is generally employed in two modalities, producing either a foreground or a background blur effect. Foreground blur images are traditionally captured on a tripod-mounted camera and portray blurred moving foreground elements, such as silky water or light trails, over a perfectly sharp background landscape. Background blur images, also called panning photography, are captured while the camera is tracking a moving subject, to produce an image of a sharp subject over a background blurred by relative motion. Both techniques are notoriously challenging and require additional equipment and advanced skills. In this paper, we describe a computational burst photography system that operates in a hand-held smartphone camera app, and achieves these effects fully automatically, at the tap of the shutter button. Our approach first detects and segments the salient subject. We track the scene motion over multiple frames and align the images in order to preserve desired sharpness and to produce aesthetically pleasing motion streaks. We capture an under-exposed burst and select the subset of input frames that will produce blur trails of controlled length, regardless of scene or camera motion velocity. We predict inter-frame motion and synthesize motion-blur to fill the temporal gaps between the input frames. Finally, we composite the blurred image with the sharp regular exposure to protect the sharpness of faces or areas of the scene that are barely moving, and produce a final high resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Our system democratizes a capability previously reserved to professionals, and makes this creative style accessible to most casual photographers.},

In this article, we focus on Satisfiablity Modulo Integer Arithmetic, which is referred to as SMT(IA), including both linear and non-linear integer arithmetic theories. Dominant approaches to SMT rely on calling a CDCL-based SAT solver, either in a lazy or eager flavour. Local search, a competitive approach to solving combinatorial problems including SAT, however, has not been well studied for SMT. We develop the first local-search algorithm for SMT(IA) by directly operating on variables, breaking through the traditional framework. We propose a local-search framework by considering the distinctions between Boolean and integer variables. Moreover, we design a novel operator and scoring functions tailored for integer arithmetic, as well as a two-level operation selection heuristic. Putting these together, we develop a local search SMT(IA) solver called LocalSMT. Experiments are carried out to evaluate LocalSMT on benchmark sets from SMT-LIB. The results show that LocalSMT is competitive and complementary with state-of-the-art SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulae with only integer variables. A simple sequential portfolio with Z3 improves the state-of-the-art on satisfiable benchmark sets from SMT-LIB.},

However, FO cannot express the very simple algorithmic question whether two vertices are connected. We enrich FO with connectivity predicates that are tailored to express algorithmic graph problems that are commonly studied in parameterized algorithmics. By adding the atomic predicates connk(x,y,z_1,..., zk) that hold true in a graph if there exists a path between (the valuations of)xandyafter (the valuations of)z1,..., zkhave been deleted, we obtainseparator logicFO + conn. We show that separator logic can express many interesting problems, such as the feedback vertex set problem and elimination distance problems to first-order definable classes. Denote by FO + connkthe fragment of separator logic that is restricted to connectivity predicates with at mostk + 2variables (that is, at mostkdeletions), we show that FO + connk + 1is strictly more expressive than FO + connkfor allk ≥ 0. We then study the limitations of separator logic and prove that it cannot express planarity, and, in particular, not the disjoint paths problem. We obtain the strongerdisjoint-paths logicFO + DP by adding the atomic predicates disjoint-pathsk[(x1, y1),..., (xk, yk) that evaluate to true if there are internally vertex-disjoint paths between (the valuations of)xiandyifor all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Disjoint-paths logic can express the disjoint paths problem, the problem of (topological) minor containment, the problem of hitting (topological) minors, and many more.

            extended resolution
            logical framework. Through this, a BDD-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver can generate a checkable proof of unsatisfiability. Such a proof indicates that the formula is truly unsatisfiable without requiring the user to trust the BDD package or the SAT solver built on top of it.
          
          We extend their work to enable arbitrary existential quantification of the formula variables, a critical capability for BDD-based SAT solvers. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying a BDD-based solver, implemented by extending an existing BDD package, to several challenging Boolean satisfiability problems. Our results demonstrate scaling for parity formulas as well as the Urquhart, mutilated chessboard, and pigeonhole problems far beyond that of other proof-generating SAT solvers.},

The heterogeneity and large number of devices are challenges to obtaining optimized resource allocation in this environment. Over time, some surveys have been presented on resource management in fog computing. However, they now lack a broader and deeper view about this subject, considering the recent publications. This article presents a systematic literature review with a focus on resource allocation for fog computing, and in a more comprehensive way than the existing works. The survey is based on 108 selected publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis has exposed their main techniques, metrics used, evaluation tools, virtualization methods, architecture, and domains where the proposed solutions were applied. The results show an updated and comprehensive view about resource allocation in fog computing. The main challenges and open research questions are discussed, and a new fog computing resource management cycle is proposed.},

  abstract = {Autonomous systems that can assist humans with increasingly complex tasks are becoming ubiquitous. Moreover, it has been established that a human’s decision to rely on such systems is a function of both their trust in the system and their own self-confidence as it relates to executing the task of interest. Given that both under- and over-reliance on automation can pose significant risks to humans, there is motivation for developing autonomous systems that could appropriately calibrate a human’s trust or self-confidence to achieve proper reliance behavior. In this article, a computational model of coupled human trust and self-confidence dynamics is proposed. The dynamics are modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process without a reward function (POMDP/R) that leverages behavioral and self-report data as observations for estimation of these cognitive states. The model is trained and validated using data collected from 340 participants. Analysis of the transition probabilities shows that the proposed model captures the probabilistic relationship between trust, self-confidence, and reliance for all discrete combinations of high and low trust and self-confidence. The use of the proposed model to design an optimal policy to facilitate trust and self-confidence calibration is a goal of future work.},

Recently, various algorithm efforts have been committed to improving image reconstruction quality and speed. However, the inference of SR contains huge amounts of computation and data access, leading to low hardware implementation efficiency. For instance, the up-sampling with the deconvolution process requires considerable computation resources. In addition, the sizes of output feature maps of several middle layers are extraordinarily large, which is challenging to optimize, causing serious data access issues. In this work, we present an all-on-chip hardware architecture based on the deconvolution scheme and feature map segmentation strategy, namely ADAS, where all the generated data by the middle layers are buffered on-chip to avoid large data movements between on- and off-chip. In ADAS, we develop a hardware-friendly and efficient deconvolution scheme to accelerate the computation. Also, the dynamic reconfigurable process element (PE) combined with efficient mapping is proposed to enhance PE utilization up to nearly 100% and support multiple scaling factors. Based on our experimental results, ADAS demonstrates real-time image SR and better image reconstruction quality with PSNR (37.15
            dB
            ) and SSIM (0.9587). Compared to baseline and validated with the FPGA platform, ADAS can support scaling factors of 2, 3, and 4, achieving 2.68 ×, 5.02 ×, and 8.28 × speedup.},

As is well-known, some diff operation (i.e., some kind of difference function showing where two unequal arrays differ) is needed to keep interpolants quantifier free in array theories. Our maxdiff operation returns the max index where two arrays differ; thus, it has a univocally determined semantics.
          The length function is a natural complement of such a maxdiff operation and is needed to handle real arrays. Obtaining interpolation results for such a rich theory is a surprisingly hard task. We get such results via a thorough semantic analysis of the models of the theory and of their amalgamation and strong amalgamation properties. The results are modular with respect to the index theory; we show how to convert them into concrete interpolation algorithms via a hierarchical approach realizing a polynomial reduction to interpolation in linear arithmetics endowed with free function symbols.},

Although the study of business Korean has aroused the strong research interest of scholars, its research focus is limited to word selection, grammatical transformation and various specific translation techniques, which is far from systematic. Good business translation should also involve factors such as the translator's role, cross-culture, and the client of translation. However, how to combine corpus with language teaching, make corpus enter the classroom and get practical application in daily language teaching is still in the exploratory stage. Most of the existing translation theories are tailored for literary translation, and business translation is a branch of non-literary translation, so these theories are difficult to guide business translation. Combined with the research results of translation studies and examples in business Korean, this paper discusses the characteristics and translation of business Korean as a special Korean, so as to provide reference for translation or related learners, and also want to attract more scholars to pay attention to business Korean and its translation.},

  abstract = {Property testing algorithms are highly efficient algorithms that come with probabilistic accuracy guarantees. For a property
            P
            , the goal is to distinguish inputs that have
            P
            from those that are
            far
            from having
            P
            with high probability correctly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the input. In property testing on graphs, the
            distance
            is measured by the number of edge modifications (additions or deletions) that are necessary to transform a graph into one with property
            P
            . Much research has focused on the
            query complexity
            of such algorithms, i. e., the number of queries the algorithm makes to the input, but in view of applications, the
            running time
            of the algorithm is equally relevant.
          
          
            In (Adler, Harwath, STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree graph model of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was introduced, and it was shown that on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic second-order logic with counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and
            sublinear
            running time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running time.
          
          
            In this article we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree model, but the distance measure allows both edge (tuple) modifications and vertex (element) modifications. We show that every property that is testable in the classical model is testable in our model with the same query complexity and running time, but the converse is not true. Our main theorem shows that on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in CMSO is testable with constant query complexity and
            constant
            running time in the new model. Our proof methods include the semilinearity of the neighborhood histograms of databases having the property and a result by Alon (Proposition 19.10 in Lovász, Large networks and graph limits, 2012) that states that for every bounded degree graph
            
              \(\mathcal {G}\)
            
            there exists a constant size graph
            
              \(\mathcal {H}\)
            
            that has a similar neighborhood distribution to 
            
              \(\mathcal {G}\)
            
            .
          
          It can be derived from a result in (Benjamini et al., Advances in Mathematics 2010) that hyperfinite hereditary properties are testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in the classical model (and hence in the new model). Using our methods, we give an alternative proof that hyperfinite hereditary properties are testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in the new model.
          We argue that our model is natural and our meta-theorem showing constant-time CMSO testability supports this.},

  abstract = {Argumentation is a well-established formalism dealing with conflicting information by generating and comparing arguments. It has been playing a major role in AI for decades. In logic-based argumentation, we explore the internal structure of an argument. Informally, a set of formulas is the support for a given claim if it is consistent, subset-minimal, and implies the claim. In such a case, the pair of the support and the claim together is called an argument. In this article, we study the propositional variants of the following three computational tasks studied in argumentation: ARG (exists a support for a given claim with respect to a given set of formulas), ARG-Check (is a given set a support for a given claim), and ARG-Rel (similarly as ARG plus requiring an additionally given formula to be contained in the support). ARG-Check is complete for the complexity class DP, and the other two problems are known to be complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (Creignou et al. 2014 and Parson et al., 2003) and, accordingly, are highly intractable. Analyzing the reason for this intractability, we perform a two-dimensional classification: First, we consider all possible propositional fragments of the problem within Schaefer’s framework (STOC 1978) and then study different parameterizations for each of the fragments. We identify a list of reasonable structural parameters (size of the claim, support, knowledge base) that are connected to the aforementioned decision problems. Eventually, we thoroughly draw a fine border of parameterized intractability for each of the problems showing where the problems are fixed-parameter tractable and when this exactly stops. Surprisingly, several cases are of very high intractability (para-NP and beyond).},

The ten operators considered in this article are shown to be all reducible to three: lexicographic revision, refinement, and severe withdrawal. In turn, these three can be expressed in terms of lexicographic revision at the cost of restructuring the sequence. This restructuring needs not to be done explicitly: an algorithm that works on the original sequence is shown. The complexity of mixed sequences of belief change operators is also analyzed. Most of them require only a polynomial number of calls to a satisfiability checker, some are even easier.},

  abstract = {Due to the exploratory nature of computational notebook development, a notebook can be extensively evolved even though it is small, potentially incurring substantial technical debt. Indeed, in interview studies notebook authors have attested to performing ongoing tidying and big cleanups. However, many notebook authors are not trained as software developers, and environments like JupyterLab possess few features to aid notebook maintenance.
          As software refactoring is traditionally a critical tool for reducing technical debt, we sought to better understand the unique and growing ecology of computational notebooks by investigating the refactoring of public Jupyter notebooks. We randomly selected 15,000 Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub and studied 200 with meaningful commit histories. We found that notebook authors do refactor, favoring a few basic classic refactorings as well as those involving the notebook cell construct. Those with a computing background refactored differently than others, but not more so. Exploration-focused notebooks had a unique refactoring profile compared to more exposition-focused notebooks. Authors more often refactored their code as they went along, rather than deferring maintenance to big cleanups. These findings point to refactoring being intrinsic to notebook development.},

Existing algorithms for photographic composition do not take full account of the spatial positioning or sizes of these salient regions. We present a set of experiments to assess aesthetic preferences, inspired by theories of centeredness, principal lines, and Rule-of-Thirds. Our experimental results show a clear preference for the salient region to be centered in the image and that there is a preferred size of non-salient border around this salient region. We thus propose a novel image cropping mechanism for images containing a single salient region to achieve the best aesthetic balance. Our results show that the Rule-of-Thirds guideline is not generally valid but also allow us to hypothesize in which situations it is useful and in which it is inappropriate.},

  abstract = {Proofs in propositional logic are typically presented as trees of derived formulas or, alternatively, as directed acyclic graphs of derived formulas. This distinction between tree-like vs. dag-like structure is particularly relevant when making quantitative considerations regarding, for example, proof size. Here we analyze a more general type of structural restriction for proofs in rule-based proof systems. In this definition, proofs are directed graphs of derived formulas in which cycles are allowed as long as every formula is derived at least as many times as it is required as a premise. We call such proofs “circular”. We show that, for all sets of standard inference rules with single or multiple conclusions, circular proofs are sound. We start the study of the proof complexity of circular proofs at Circular Resolution, the circular version of Resolution. We immediately see that Circular Resolution is stronger than dag-like Resolution since, as we show, the propositional encoding of the pigeonhole principle has circular Resolution proofs of polynomial size. Furthermore, for derivations of clauses from clauses, we show that Circular Resolution is, surprisingly, equivalent to Sherali-Adams, a proof system for reasoning through polynomial inequalities that has linear programming at its base. As corollaries we get: (1) polynomial-time (LP-based) algorithms that find Circular Resolution proofs of constant width, (2) examples that separate Circular from dag-like Resolution, such as the pigeonhole principle and its variants, and (3) exponentially hard cases for Circular Resolution. Contrary to the case of Circular Resolution, for Frege we show that circular proofs can be converted into tree-like proofs with at most polynomial overhead.},

  abstract = {Eager equality for algebraic expressions over partial algebras distinguishes or separates terms only if both have defined values and they are different. We consider arithmetical algebras with division as a partial operator, called meadows, and focus on algebras of rational numbers. To study eager equality, we use common meadows, which are totalisations of partial meadows by means of absorptive elements. An axiomatisation of common meadows is the basis of an axiomatisation of eager equality as a predicate on a common meadow. Applied to the rational numbers, we prove completeness and decidability of the equational theory of eager equality. To situate eager equality theoretically, we consider two other partial equalities of increasing strictness: Kleene equality, which is equivalent to the native equality of common meadows, and one we call cautious equality. Our methods of analysis for eager equality are quite general, and so we apply them to these two other partial equalities; and, in addition to common meadows, we use three other kinds of algebra designed to totalise division. In summary, we are able to compare 13 forms of equality for the partial meadow of rational numbers. We focus on the decidability of the equational theories of these equalities. We show that for the four total algebras, eager and cautious equality are decidable. We also show that for others the Diophantine Problem over the rationals is one-one computably reducible to their equational theories. The Diophantine Problem for rationals is a longstanding open problem. Thus, eager equality has substantially less complex semantics.},

The results obtained indicate that global-coarsening algorithms show a better parallel behavior for comparable smoothers due to the better load balance, particularly on the expensive fine levels. In the serial case, the costs of applying hanging-node constraints might be significant, leading to advantages of local smoothing, even though the number of solver iterations needed is slightly higher.

We propose Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (LTQL), a linear temporal extension of quantum logic with a quantum implication, and extend it to Dynamic Linear Temporal Quantum Logic (DLTQL). This logic has temporal operators to express transitions by unitary operators (quantum gates) and dynamic ones to express those by projections (projective measurement). We then prove some logical properties of the relationship between these two transitions expressed by LTQL and DLTQL. A drawback in applying LTQL to the verification of quantum protocols is that these logics cannot express the future operator in linear temporal logic. We propose a way to mitigate this drawback by using a translation from (D)LTQL to Linear Temporal Modal Logic (LTML) and a simulation. This translation reduces the satisfiability problem of (D)LTQL formulas to that of LTML with the classical semantics over quantum states.},

We give both positive and negative results about the ability to decide monotonic determinacy, and also about the co-incidence of monotonic determinacy with Datalog rewritability.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations can help solve complex problems. Most of these algorithms are massively parallel and thus good candidates for FPGA acceleration thanks to spatial parallelism. Modern FPGA devices can leverage high-bandwidth memory technologies, but when applications are memory-bound designers must craft advanced communication and memory architectures for efficient data movement and on-chip storage. This development process requires hardware design skills that are uncommon in domain-specific experts. In this article, we propose an automated tool flow from a domain-specific language for tensor expressions to generate massively parallel accelerators on high-bandwidth-memory-equipped FPGAs. Designers can use this flow to integrate and evaluate various compiler or hardware optimizations. We use
            computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
            as a paradigmatic example. Our flow starts from the high-level specification of tensor operations and combines a multi-level intermediate representation–based compiler with an in-house hardware generation flow to generate systems with parallel accelerators and a specialized memory architecture that moves data efficiently, aiming at fully exploiting the available CPU-FPGA bandwidth. We simulated applications with millions of elements, achieving up to 103 GFLOPS with one compute unit and custom precision when targeting a Xilinx Alveo U280. Our FPGA implementation is up to 25× more energy efficient than expert-crafted Intel CPU implementations.},

  abstract = {Applying artificial intelligence to Chinese language translation in computational linguistics is of practical significance for economic boosts and cultural exchanges. In the present work, the bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is employed to extract Chinese text features regarding the overlapping semantic roles in Chinese language translation and hard-to-converge training of high-dimensional text word vectors in text classification during translation. In addition, AlexNet is optimized to extract the local features of the text and meanwhile update and learn network parameters in the deep network. Then, the attention mechanism is introduced to build a forecasting algorithm of Chinese language translation based on BiLSTM and improved AlexNet. Last, the forecasting algorithm is simulated to validate its performance. Some state-of-the-art algorithms are selected for a comparative experiment, including long short-term memory, regions with convolutional neural network features, AlexNet, and support vector machine. Results demonstrate that the forecasting algorithm proposed here can achieve a feature identification accuracy of 90.55%, at least an improvement of 4.24% over other algorithms. In addition, it provides an area under the curve of above 90%, a training duration of about 54.21 seconds, and a test duration of about 19.07 seconds. Regarding the performance of Chinese language translation, the algorithm proposed here provides a bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) value of 28.21 on the training set, with a performance gain ratio reaching 111.55%; on the test set, its BLEU reaches 40.45, with a performance gain ratio of 129.80%. Hence, this forecasting algorithm is notably superior to other algorithms, which can enhance the machine translation performance. Through experiments, the Chinese language translation algorithm constructed here improves translation performance while ensuring a high correct identification rate, providing experimental references for the later intelligent development of Chinese language translation in computational linguistics.},

We validate the GEO framework in experiments with real-world datasets and describe some resulting managerial implications for automotive facelift. Our study makes both methodological and application contributions. First, the generator’s mapping network and projection methods are carefully tailored to facelift where only minor changes are performed without affecting the family signature of the automobile brands. Second, two evaluation metrics are proposed to assess the generated designs. Third, profit maximisation is taken into account in the design selection. From a high-level perspective, our study contributes to the recent use of machine learning and data mining in marketing and design studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses deep generative models for automotive regional design upgrading and that provides an end-to-end decision-support solution for automakers and designers.},

In this article, we contribute to this effort by giving the first computational complexity analyses of problems associated with algorithm, environmental influence, and leader selection methods for the control of swarms performing distributed construction tasks. These analyses are done relative to a simple model in which swarms of deterministic finite-state robots operate in a synchronous error-free manner in 2D grid-based environments. We show that all three of our problems are polynomial-time intractable in general and remain intractable under a number of plausible restrictions (both individually and in many combinations) on robot controllers, environments, target structures, and sequences of swarm control commands. We also give the first restrictions relative to which these problems are tractable, as well as discussions of the implications of our results for both the design and deployment of swarm control assistance software tools and the human control of swarms.},

            using a hexagonal tiling-based approach. In addition, we compute the sensor density (i.e., number of sensors per unit area) for each of the above sensor placement strategies. Second, we propose a generalized one using irregular hexagons, which are denoted by

  abstract = {Hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) would overload database systems. To alleviate performance interference between transactions and analytics, recent research pursues the potential of in-storage processing (ISP) using commodity computational storage devices (CSDs). However, in-storage query processing faces technical challenges in HTAP environments. Continuously updated data versions pose two hurdles: (1) data items keep changing, and (2) finding visible data versions incurs excessive data access in CSDs. Such access patterns dominate the cost of query processing, which may hinder the active deployment of CSDs.

            canonical representation
            of vendor-specific data and the separate management of data locators. It enables any CSD to execute vendor-neutral operations on canonical tuples with separate indexes, regardless of host databases. To eliminate excessive data access, we
            prescreen
            the indexes before offloading; thus, host-side prescreening can obviate the need for running costly version searching in CSDs and boost analytics. We implemented our prototype for PostgreSQL and MyRocks, demonstrating that AIDE supports efficient ISP for two databases using the same FPGA logic. Evaluation results show that AIDE improves query latency up to 42× on PostgreSQL and 34× on MyRocks.},

            -CSP, which can capture discrete time properties. This version of CSP has been of widespread interest for decades; recently, it has been given a denotational semantics, and model checking has become possible using a well established tool. Here, we first equip
            tock
            -CSP with a novel semantics for testing, which distinguishes input and output events: the standard models of (
            tock
            -)CSP do not differentiate them, but for testing this is essential. We then present a new testing theory for timewise refinement, based on novel definitions of test and test execution. Finally, we reconcile refinement and testing by relating timed ioco testing and refinement in
            tock
            -CSP with inputs and outputs. With these results, this paper provides, for the first time, a systematic theory that allows both timed testing and timed refinement to be expressed. An important practical consequence is that this ensures that the notion of correctness used by developers guarantees that tests pass when applied to a correct system and, in addition, faults identified during testing correspond to development mistakes.},

  abstract = {Parikh proposed his relevance-sensitive axiom to remedy the weakness of the classical AGM paradigm in addressing relevant change. An insufficiency of Parikh’s criterion, however, is its dependency on the contingent beliefs of a belief set to be revised, since the former only constrains the revision process of splittable theories (i.e., theories that can be divided in mutually disjoint compartments). The case of arbitrary non-splittable belief sets remains out of the scope of Parikh’s approach. On that premise, we generalize Parikh’s criterion, introducing (both axiomatically and semantically) a new notion of relevance, which we call
            relevance at the sentential level
            . We show that the proposed notion of relevance is universal (as it is applicable to arbitrary belief sets) and acts in a more refined way as compared to Parikh’s proposal; as we illustrate, this latter feature of relevance at the sentential level potentially leads to a significant drop in the computational resources required for implementing belief revision. Furthermore, we prove that Dalal’s popular revision operator respects, to a certain extent, relevance at the sentential level. Last but not least, the tight relation between local and relevance-sensitive revision is pointed out.},

It is a declarative problem solving paradigm that can be used to encode a problem as a logic program whose answer sets correspond to the solutions of the problem. It has been widely applied in various domains in AI and beyond. Given that answer sets are supposed to yield solutions to the original problem, the question of “why a set of atoms is an answer set” becomes important for both semantics understanding and program debugging. It has been well investigated for normal logic programs. However, for the class of disjunctive logic programs, which is a substantial extension of that of normal logic programs, this question has not been addressed much. In this article, we propose a notion of reduct for disjunctive logic programs and show how it can provide answers to the aforementioned question. First, we show that for each answer set, its reduct provides a resolution proof for each atom in it. We then further consider minimal sets of rules that will be sufficient to provide resolution proofs for sets of atoms. Such sets of rules will be called witnesses and are the focus of this article. We study complexity issues of computing various witnesses and provide algorithms for computing them. In particular, we show that the problem is tractable for normal and headcycle-free disjunctive logic programs, but intractable for general disjunctive logic programs. We also conducted some experiments and found that for many well-known ASP and SAT benchmarks, computing a minimal witness for an atom of an answer set is often feasible.},

            16
            ], but leaving open the most important case of QBF resolution. Different from the Frege case, our characterisation uses a new version of decision lists as its circuit model, which is stronger than the CNFs the system works with. Our decision list model is well suited to compute countermodels for QBFs. Our characterisation works for both
            Q-Resolution and QU-Resolution.
          
          
            Using our characterisation, we obtain a
            size-width relation for QBF resolution
            in the spirit of the celebrated result for propositional resolution [
            4

            12

            We demonstrate that

In doing this, we study the special forms of PGP, switchability, and collapsibility, in detail, both algebraically and logically, addressing various questions such as decidability on the way.
          
          
            We then prove a complexity-theoretic converse in the case of infinite constraint languages encoded in propositional logic, that if Inv}(𝔸) satisfies the exponentially generated powers property (EGP), then QCSP (Inv(𝔸)) is co-NP-hard. Since Zhuk proved that only PGP and EGP are possible, we derive a full dichotomy for the QCSP, justifying what we term the
            Revised Chen Conjecture
            . This result becomes more significant now that the original Chen Conjecture (see [
            3

            Switchability was introduced by Chen [

            ] as a generalization of the already-known collapsibility [
            5
            ]. There, an algebra 𝔸 :=({ 0,1,2};
            r
            ) was given that is switchable and not collapsible. We prove that, for all finite subsets Δ of Inv (𝔸 A), Pol (Δ) is collapsible. The significance of this is that, for QCSP on finite structures, it is still possible all QCSP tractability (in NP) explained by switchability is already explained by collapsibility. At least, no counterexample is known to this.},

Using a proof technique qualitatively different from the lower bounds that MaxResW inherits from Res, we show that Tseitin contradictions on expander graphs are hard to refute in SubCubeSums.

In particular, we want to characterize the models of an ontology up to isomorphism and determine whether or not these models are equivalent to the intended models of the ontology. Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to characterize the models of an ontology up to isomorphism. In the first half of this article, we review the different metalogical relationships between first-order theories and identify which relationship is needed for ontology verification. In particular, we will demonstrate that the notion of logical synonymy is needed to specify a representation theorem for the class of models of one first-order ontology with respect to another. In the second half of the article, we discuss the notion of reducible theories and show we can specify representation theorems by which models are constructed by amalgamating models of the constituent ontologies.},

Rephrasing these methods as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is a particularly effective approach to study existing techniques, improve them, and eventually derive new ones. The accuracy of these matrix techniques can be characterized by the accuracy of their scalar counterparts, thus designing algorithms for matrix functions can be regarded as a scalar-valued optimization problem. The derivatives needed during the optimization can be calculated automatically by exploiting the structure of the DAG in a fashion analogous to backpropagation. This article describes
            GraphMatFun.jl
            , a Julia package that offers the means to generate and manipulate computational graphs, optimize their coefficients, and generate Julia, MATLAB, and C code to evaluate them efficiently at a matrix argument. The software also provides tools to estimate the accuracy of a graph-based algorithm and thus obtain numerically reliable methods. For the exponential, for example, using a particular form (degree-optimal) of polynomials produces implementations that in many cases are cheaper, in terms of computational cost, than the Padé-based techniques typically used in mathematical software. The optimized graphs and the corresponding generated code are available online.},

Each team independently conducted a thematic analysis of a corpus of comments from Canadian news sites to understand discourses around vaccine hesitancy. We then compared the analyses to investigate how computational techniques may have influenced their research process and outcomes.

            G
            need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. To scan their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a vertex incurs some cost in terms of energy or rotation time that is proportional to the corresponding rotation angle. Our goal is to compute schedules that minimize the following objective functions: (i) in
            Minimum Makespan Scan Cover
            (MSC-MS), this is the time until all edges are scanned; (ii) in

          Previous theoretical work on MSC-MS revealed a close connection to graph coloring and the cut cover problem, leading to hardness and approximability results. In this article, we present polynomial-time algorithms for one-dimensional (1D) instances of MSC-TE and MSC-BE but NP-hardness proofs for bipartite 2D instances. For bipartite graphs in 2D, we also give 2-approximation algorithms for both MSC-TE and MSC-BE. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive study of practical methods for all three problems. We compare three different mixed-integer programming and two constraint programming approaches and show how to compute provably optimal solutions for geometric instances with up to 300 edges. Additionally, we compare the performance of different meta-heuristics for even larger instances.},

However, many analyses only require loading in the data containing particular features of interest and scientists have many approaches for identifying these features. Therefore, if scientists store information (descriptive metadata) about these identified features, then for subsequent analyses they can use this information to only read in the data containing these features. This can greatly reduce the amount of data that scientists have to read in, thereby accelerating analysis. Despite the potential benefits of descriptive metadata management, no prior work has created a descriptive metadata system that can help scientists working with a wide range of applications and analyses to restrict their reads to data containing features of interest. In this article, we present EMPRESS, the first such solution. EMPRESS offers all of the features needed to help accelerate discovery: It can accelerate analysis by up to 300 ×, supports a wide range of applications and analyses, is high-performing, is highly scalable, and requires minimal storage space.

Consequently, trustworthy AI has recently garnered increased attention regarding the need to avoid the adverse effects that AI could bring to people, so people can fully trust and live in harmony with AI technologies.A tremendous amount of research on trustworthy AI has been conducted and witnessed in recent years. In this survey, we present a comprehensive appraisal of trustworthy AI from a computational perspective to help readers understand the latest technologies for achieving trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI is a large and complex subject, involving various dimensions. In this work, we focus on six of the most crucial dimensions in achieving trustworthy AI: (i) Safety &amp; Robustness, (ii) Nondiscrimination &amp; Fairness, (iii) Explainability, (iv) Privacy, (v) Accountability &amp; Auditability, and (vi) Environmental Well-being. For each dimension, we review the recent related technologies according to a taxonomy and summarize their applications in real-world systems.

While the pervasiveness of algorithmic bias has been widely acknowledged, and perceptions of fairness are commonly studied in Human Computer Interaction, there is a lack of research on how unfair treatment by automated computational systems is experienced by users from disadvantaged and marginalised backgrounds. There is a need for more diversification in terms of the investigated users, domains, and tasks, and regarding the strategies that users employ to reduce harm. To unpack these issues, we ran a prescreened survey of 663 participants, oversampling those with at-risk characteristics. We collected occurrences and types of conflicts regarding unfair and discriminatory treatment and systems, as well as the actions taken towards resolving these situations. Drawing on intersectional research, we combine qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to highlight the nuances around power and privilege in the perceptions of automated computational systems. Among our participants, we discuss experiences of computational essentialism, attribute-based exclusion, and expected harm. We derive suggestions to address these perceptions of unfairness as they occur.},

Motivated by quantum linear algebra algorithms and the quantum singular value transformation (SVT) framework of Gilyén et al. [STOC’19], we develop classical algorithms for SVT that run in time independent of input dimension, under suitable quantum-inspired sampling assumptions. Our results give compelling evidence that in the corresponding QRAM data structure input model, quantum SVT does not yield exponential quantum speedups. Since the quantum SVT framework generalizes essentially all known techniques for quantum linear algebra, our results, combined with sampling lemmas from previous work, suffice to generalize all prior results about dequantizing quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis.

  abstract = {Computational support for learning in the domain of esports has seen a great deal of attention in recent years as an effective means of helping players learn and reap the benefits of play. However, previous work has not examined the tools from a learning theory perspective to assess if learning is prompted and supported in the right place and time. As a first step towards addressing this gap, this paper presents the results of two studies: a review of existing computational tools, and an online survey of esports' players' learning needs supplemented with qualitative interviews. Using Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model of Self-Regulated Learning as a lens, we identify patterns in the types of support offered by existing tools and players' support interests during different learning phases. We identify 11 opportunities for future research and development to better support self-regulated learning in esports.},

            weakest liberal preconditions
            for weak memory. This characterisation naturally extends to Hoare logic and Owicki-Gries reasoning by lifting weakest liberal preconditions (defined over read/write events) to the level of programs. We study three memory models (SC, TSO, and RC11-RAR) as example instantiations of the axioms, then we demonstrate the applicability of our reasoning technique on a number of litmus tests. The majority of the proofs in this article are supported by mechanisation within Isabelle/HOL.},

            analytic calculi
            (i.e., those calculi that support general and modular proof-strategies for cut elimination) and at identifying classes of logics that can be captured in terms of these calculi. In this context, Wansing introduced the notion of
            proper display calculi
            as one possible design framework for proof calculi in which the analyticity desiderata are realized in a particularly transparent way. Recently, the theory of
            properly displayable
            logics (i.e., those logics that can be equivalently presented with some proper display calculus) has been developed in connection with generalized Sahlqvist theory (a.k.a. unified correspondence). Specifically, properly displayable logics have been syntactically characterized as those axiomatized by
            analytic inductive axioms
            , which can be equivalently and algorithmically transformed into analytic structural rules so the resulting proper display calculi enjoy a set of basic properties: soundness, completeness, conservativity, cut elimination, and the subformula property. In this context, the proof that the given calculus is
            complete
            w.r.t. the original logic is usually carried out
            syntactically
            , i.e., by showing that a (cut-free) derivation exists of each given axiom of the logic in the basic system to which the analytic structural rules algorithmically generated from the given axiom have been added. However, so far, this proof strategy for
            syntactic completeness
            has been implemented on a case-by-case base and not in general. In this article, we address this gap by proving syntactic completeness for properly displayable logics in any normal (distributive) lattice expansion signature. Specifically, we show that for every analytic inductive axiom a cut-free derivation can be effectively generated that has a specific shape, referred to as
            pre-normal form

            different from standard type theories is the presence of first-class contexts and contextual objects to describe syntax trees that are closed with respect to a given context of assumptions. Following M. Hofmann’s work, we use a presheaf model to characterise HOAS trees. Surprisingly, this model already provides the necessary structure to also model
            Cocon
            . In particular, we can capture the contextual objects of
            Cocon
            using a comonad ♭ that restricts presheaves to their closed elements. This gives a simple semantic characterisation of the invariants of contextual types (e.g. substitution invariance) and identifies
            Cocon
            as a type-theoretic syntax of presheaf models. We further extend this characterisation to dependent types using categories with families and show that we can model a fragment of

  abstract = {We design a proof system for propositional classical logic that integrates two languages for Boolean functions: standard conjunction-disjunction-negation and binary decision trees. We give two reasons to do so. The first is proof-theoretical naturalness: The system consists of all and only the inference rules generated by the single, simple, linear scheme of the recently introduced subatomic logic. Thanks to this regularity, cuts are eliminated via a natural construction. The second reason is that the system generates efficient proofs. Indeed, we show that a certain class of tautologies due to Statman, which cannot have better than exponential cut-free proofs in the sequent calculus, have polynomial cut-free proofs in our system. We achieve this by using the same construction that we use for cut elimination. In summary, by expanding the language of propositional logic, we make its proof theory more regular and generate more proofs, some of which are very efficient.
          That design is made possible by considering atoms as superpositions of their truth values, which are connected by self-dual, non-commutative connectives. A proof can then be projected via each atom into two proofs, one for each truth value, without a need for cuts. Those projections are semantically natural and are at the heart of the constructions in this article. To accommodate self-dual non-commutativity, we compose proofs in deep inference.},

We then extend the Cenzer/Weber analysis to the intersection of multiple random closed sets, identifying the Bernoulli measures with respect to which the intersection of relatively random closed sets can be non-empty. We lastly apply our analysis to provide a characterization of the effective Hausdorff dimension of sequences in terms of the degree of intersectability of random closed sets that contain them.},

Applications that can benefit from in situ processing include distributed training, distributed inferencing, and databases. To achieve the full advantage of the proposed ISP architecture, we propose software solutions for workload balancing before and at runtime for training and inferencing applications. Other applications such as sharding-based databases can readily take advantage of our ISP structure without additional tooling. Experimental results on different capacity and form factors of CSDs show up to 3.1× speedup in processing while reducing the energy consumption and data transfer by up to 67% and 68%, respectively, compared to regular enterprise solid state drives.},

The intricate and diverse physical space of CPS in the smart city is mapped in virtual space to construct the DTs CPS in the smart city. Besides, Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph-Big Multigraph (DPFS-BM) is employed to ensure data privacy security. Moreover, the analysis and prediction model for the DTs big graphic data (BGD) in the CPS is built based on Differential Privacy-AlexNet (DP-AlexNet). Alexnet successfully solves the gradient dispersion problem of the Sigmoid function of deep network structures. Finally, the comparative analysis approach is utilized to verify the performance of the model reported here by comparing it with Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, original AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron in a simulation experiment. Through the comparison in the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error, training time, and test time, the model proposed here outperforms other models regarding errors, time delay, and time consumption. In the same environment, the system performs better with multi-hop paths, extra relays, and a high fading index; in that case, the outage probability is minimal. Therefore, the DP-AlexNet model is suitable for processing BGD. Moreover, its speed acceleration is more apparent than that of other models, with a higher SpeedUp indicator. The research effectively combines data mining and data security, which is of significant value for optimizing the privacy protection technology of frequent subgraph mining on a single multi-graph. Besides, the constructed DTs of CPS can provide excellent accuracy and a prominent acceleration effect on the premise of low errors. In addition, the model reported here can provide reference for the intelligent and digital development of smart cities.},

  abstract = {In the mirror cup and saucer art created by artists Yul Cho and Sang-Ha Cho, part of the saucer is directly visible to the viewer, while the other part of the saucer is occluded and can only be seen as a reflection through a mirror cup. Thus, viewers see an image directly on the saucer and another image on the mirror cup; however, the existing art design is limited to wavelike saucers. In this work, we propose a general computational framework for mirror cup and saucer art design. As input, we take from the user one image for the direct view, one image for the reflected view, and the base shape of the saucer. Our algorithm then generates a suitable saucer shape by deforming the input shape. We formulate this problem as a constrained optimization for the saucer surface. Our framework solves for the fine geometry details on the base shape along with its texture, such that when a mirror cup is placed on the saucer, the user-specified images are observed as direct and reflected views. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the great design flexibility that it offers to users. We further validate the produced art pieces by fabricating the colored saucers using three-dimensional printing.},

  abstract = {With chip manufacturers such as Intel, IBM, and ARM offering native support for transactional memory in their instruction set architectures, memory transactions are on the verge of being considered a genuine application tool rather than just an interesting research topic. Despite this recent increase in popularity on the
            hardware side of transactional memory (HTM)
            ,
            software support for transactional memory (STM)
            is still scarce and the only compiler with transactional support currently available, the
            GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

            hybrid solutions of TM (HyTM)
            , which are frameworks that leverage the best aspects of HTM and STM, the subpar performance of the software side, caused by inefficient compiler generated code, might forbid HyTM to offer optimal results. This article extends previous work focused exclusively on STM implementations by presenting a detailed analysis of transactional code generated by GCC in the context of HybridTM implementations. In particular, it builds on previous research of transactional memory support in the Clang/LLVM compiler framework, which is decoupled from any TM runtime, and presents the following novel contributions: (a) it shows that STM’s performance overhead, due to an excessive amount of read and write barriers added by the compiler, also impacts the performance of HyTM systems; and (b) it reveals the importance of the previously proposed annotation mechanism to reduce the performance gap between HTM and STM in phased runtime systems. Furthermore, it shows that, by correctly using the annotations on just a few lines of code, it is possible to reduce the total number of instrumented barriers by 95% and to achieve speed-ups of up to 7× when compared to the original code generated by GCC and the Clang compiler.

  abstract = {This work proposes a novel generative design tool for passive grippers---robot end effectors that have no additional actuation and instead leverage the existing degrees of freedom in a robotic arm to perform grasping tasks. Passive grippers are used because they offer interesting trade-offs between cost and capabilities. However, existing designs are limited in the types of shapes that can be grasped. This work proposes to use rapid-manufacturing and design optimization to expand the space of shapes that can be passively grasped. Our novel generative design algorithm takes in an object and its positioning with respect to a robotic arm and generates a 3D printable passive gripper that can stably pick the object up. To achieve this, we address the key challenge of jointly optimizing the shape and the insert trajectory to ensure a passively stable grasp. We evaluate our method on a testing suite of 22 objects (23 experiments), all of which were evaluated with physical experiments to bridge the virtual-to-real gap.

            high-level
            , interlocking puzzles are a subclass of interlocking puzzles that require multiple moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. Solving a high-level interlocking puzzle is a challenging task since one has to explore many different configurations of the puzzle pieces until reaching a configuration where the first subassembly can be taken out. Designing a high-level interlocking puzzle with a user-specified level of difficulty is even harder since the puzzle pieces have to be interlocking in all the configurations before the first subassembly is taken out.
          
          
            In this paper, we present a computational approach to design high-level interlocking puzzles. The core idea is to represent all possible configurations of an interlocking puzzle as well as transitions among these configurations using a rooted, undirected graph called a
            disassembly graph
            and leverage this graph to find a disassembly plan that requires a minimal number of moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. At the design stage, our algorithm iteratively constructs the geometry of each puzzle piece to expand the disassembly graph incrementally, aiming to achieve a user-specified level of difficulty. We show that our approach allows efficient generation of high-level interlocking puzzles of various shape complexities, including new solutions not attainable by state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for computing a sewing pattern of a given 3D garment model. Our algorithm segments an input 3D garment shape into patches and computes their 2D parameterization, resulting in pattern pieces that can be cut out of fabric and sewn together to manufacture the garment. Unlike the general state-of-the-art approaches for surface cutting and flattening, our method explicitly targets garment fabrication. It accounts for the unique properties and constraints of tailoring, such as seam symmetry, the usage of darts, fabric grain alignment, and a flattening distortion measure that models woven fabric deformation, respecting its anisotropic behavior. We bootstrap a recent patch layout approach developed for quadrilateral remeshing and adapt it to the purpose of computational pattern making, ensuring that the deformation of each pattern piece stays within prescribed bounds of cloth stress. While our algorithm can automatically produce the sewing patterns, it is fast enough to admit user input to creatively iterate on the pattern design. Our method can take several target poses of the 3D garment into account and integrate them into the sewing pattern design. We demonstrate results on both skintight and loose garments, showcasing the versatile application possibilities of our approach.},

Firstly, in this paper we show that Near-Data Processing (NDP) naturally fits in the HTAP design space. Secondly, we propose an NDP database architecture, allowing transactionally consistent in-situ executions of analytical operations in HTAP settings. We evaluate the proposed architecture in state-of-the-art key/value-stores and multi-versioned DBMS. In contrast to traditional setups, our approach yields robust, resource- and cost-efficient performance.},

  abstract = {We describe a general and safe computational framework that provides integer programming results with the degree of certainty that is required for machine-assisted proofs of mathematical theorems. At its core, the framework relies on a rational branch-and-bound certificate produced by an exact integer programming solver, SCIP, in order to circumvent floating-point round-off errors present in most state-of-the-art solvers for mixed-integer programs. The resulting certificates are self-contained and checker software exists that can verify their correctness independently of the integer programming solver used to produce the certificate. This acts as a safeguard against programming errors that may be present in complex solver software. The viability of this approach is tested by applying it to finite cases of Chvátal’s conjecture, a long-standing open question in extremal combinatorics. We take particular care to verify also the correctness of the input for this specific problem, using the Coq formal proof assistant. As a result, we are able to provide the first machine-assisted proof that Chvátal’s conjecture holds for all downsets whose union of sets contains seven elements or less.},

  abstract = {This article presents Computational SRAM (C-SRAM) solution combining In- and Near-Memory Computing approaches. It allows performing arithmetic, logic, and complex memory operations inside or next to the memory without transferring data over the system bus, leading to significant energy reduction. Operations are performed on large vectors of data occupying the entire physical row of C-SRAM array, leading to high performance gains. We introduce the C-SRAM solution in this article as an integrated vector processing unit to be used by a scalar processor as an energy-efficient and high performing co-processor. We detail the C-SRAM system design on different levels: (i) circuit design and silicon proof of concept, (ii) system interface and instruction set architecture, and (iii) high-level software programming and simulation. Experimental results on two complete memory-bound applications, AES and MobileNetV2, show that the C-SRAM implementation achieves up to 70× timing speedup and 37× energy reduction compared to scalar architecture, and up to 17× timing speedup and 5× energy reduction compared to SIMD architecture.},

In this paper we show that, under a general condition, the satisfiability problem on sums is polynomial space Turing reducible to the satisfiability problem on summands. In particular, for many modal logics decidability in PSpace is an immediate corollary from the semantic characterization of the logic.},

The presented research focuses on 12 unique muqarnas structures that are analyzed through a computational methodology combining photogrammetry, three-dimensional modeling, symmetry, and graph theory. The computational analysis shows that Seljukid muqarnas exhibit patterned branching of the symmetry axis between layers radiating from their geometric center.

This is particularly true given that developing a general-purpose quantum computer is much more difficult than connecting many small quantum devices. One major challenge of implementing distributed quantum systems is programming them and verifying their correctness. In this paper, we propose a CSP-like distributed programming language to facilitate the specification and verification of such systems. After presenting its operational and denotational semantics, we develop a Hoare-style logic for distributed quantum programs and establish its soundness and (relative) completeness with respect to both partial and total correctness. The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated by its applications in the verification of quantum teleportation and local implementation of non-local CNOT gates, two important algorithms widely used in distributed quantum systems.},

  abstract = {It is well known that big-step semantics is not able to distinguish stuck and non-terminating computations. This is a strong limitation as it makes it very difficult to reason about properties involving infinite computations, such as type soundness, which cannot even be expressed.
          We show that this issue is only apparent: the distinction between stuck and diverging computations is implicit in any big-step semantics and it just needs to be uncovered. To achieve this goal, we develop a systematic study of big-step semantics: we introduce an abstract definition of what a big-step semantics is, we define a notion of computation by formalizing the evaluation algorithm implicitly associated with any big-step semantics, and we show how to canonically extend a big-step semantics to characterize stuck and diverging computations.
          Building on these notions, we describe a general proof technique to show that a predicate is sound, that is, it prevents stuck computation, with respect to a big-step semantics. One needs to check three properties relating the predicate and the semantics, and if they hold, the predicate is sound. The extended semantics is essential to establish this meta-logical result but is of no concerns to the user, who only needs to prove the three properties of the initial big-step semantics. Finally, we illustrate the technique by several examples, showing that it is applicable also in cases where subject reduction does not hold, and hence the standard technique for small-step semantics cannot be used.},

With just about 1 minute left in the routine it shifts to some massage movements. The first is to rub your hands to relax then from the particular poses they have been in. I started to rub my right hand with my left. All of a sudden, I had this eerie sensation that someone else was touching my hand and arm. I looked around. No one was in the room. The feeling persisted. I spoke aloud. "Stop it; your scaring me." I felt dizzy and nauseous. I went to grab the remote in order to turn off the TV. "What; it was right here a minute ago." At this point, I couldn't care about the TV. I decided I needed to lie down. I made my way up the first flight of stairs in our split-level house and for reasons that I could not articulate I felt uncertain that I could not make it upstairs.

With this aim, we first look for best practices through a multivocal literature review. Then, we conduct interviews with professional data scientists to assess their awareness of these best practices. Finally, we assess the adoption of best practices through the analysis of 1,380 Jupyter notebooks retrieved from the Kaggle platform. Findings reveal that experts are mostly aware of the best practices and tend to adopt them in their daily work. Nonetheless, they do not consistently follow all the recommendations as, depending on specific contexts, some are deemed unfeasible or counterproductive due to the lack of proper tool support. As such, we envision the design of notebook solutions that allow data scientists not to have to prioritize exploration and rapid prototyping over writing code of quality.},

  abstract = {Co-creative proccesses between people can be characterized by rich dialogue that carries each person's ideas into the collaborative space. When people co-create an artifact that is both technical and aesthetic, their dialogue reflects the interplay between these two dimensions. However, the dialogue mechanisms that express this interplay and the extent to which they are related to outcomes, such as peer satisfaction, are not well understood. This paper reports on a study of 68 high school learner dyads' textual dialogues as they create music by writing code together in a digital learning environment for musical remixing. We report on a novel dialogue taxonomy built to capture the technical and aesthetic dimensions of learners' collaborative dialogues. We identified dialogue act n-grams (sequences of length 1, 2, or 3) that are present within the corpus and discovered five significant n-gram predictors for whether a learner felt satisfied with their partner during the collaboration. The learner was more likely to report higher satisfaction with their partner when the learner frequently acknowledges their partner, exchanges positive feedback with their partner, and their partner proposes an idea and elaborates on the idea. In contrast, the learner is more likely to report lower satisfaction with their partner when the learner frequently accepts back-to-back proposals from their partner and when the partner responds to the learner's statements with positive feedback. This work advances understanding of collaborative dialogue within co-creative domains and suggests dialogue strategies that may be helpful to foster co-creativity as learners collaborate to produce a creative artifact. The findings also suggest important areas of focus for intelligent or adaptive systems that aim to support learners during the co-creative process.},

  abstract = {Experimental results are often plotted as 2-dimensional graphical plots (aka graphs) in scientific domains depicting dependent versus independent variables to aid visual analysis of processes. Repeatedly performing laboratory experiments consumes significant time and resources, motivating the need for computational estimation. The goals are to estimate the graph obtained in an experiment given its input conditions, and to estimate the conditions that would lead to a desired graph. Existing estimation approaches often do not meet accuracy and efficiency needs of targeted applications. We develop a computational estimation approach called AutoDomainMine that integrates clustering and classification over complex scientific data in a framework so as to automate classical learning methods of scientists. Knowledge discovered thereby from a database of existing experiments serves as the basis for estimation. Challenges include preserving domain semantics in clustering, finding matching strategies in classification, striking a good balance between elaboration and conciseness while displaying estimation results based on needs of targeted users, and deriving objective measures to capture subjective user interests. These and other challenges are addressed in this work. The AutoDomainMine approach is used to build a computational estimation system, rigorously evaluated with real data in Materials Science. Our evaluation confirms that AutoDomainMine provides desired accuracy and efficiency in computational estimation. It is extendable to other science and engineering domains as proved by adaptation of its sub-processes within fields such as Bioinformatics and Nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Large-scale overdetermined linear least squares problems arise in many practical applications. One popular solution method is based on the backward stable QR factorization of the system matrix

            . This article focuses on sparse-dense least squares problems in which
            A
            is sparse except from a small number of rows that are considered dense. For large-scale problems, the direct application of a QR solver either fails because of insufficient memory or is unacceptably slow. We study several solution approaches based on using a sparse QR solver without modification, focussing on the case that the sparse part of
            A
            is rank deficient. We discuss partial matrix stretching and regularization and propose extending the augmented system formulation with iterative refinement for sparse problems to sparse-dense problems, optionally incorporating multi-precision arithmetic. In summary, our computational study shows that, before applying a black-box QR factorization, a check should be made for rows that are classified as dense and, if such rows are identified, then
            A
            should be split into sparse and dense blocks; a number of ways to use a black-box QR factorization to exploit this splitting are possible, with no single method found to be the best in all cases.},

Additional to epistemic modalities the logic contains dynamic modalities for making announcements and for receiving them. What an agent believes is a function of her initial uncertainty and of the announcements she has received. Beliefs need not be truthful, because announcements already made may not yet have been received. As announcements are true when sent, certain message sequences can be ruled out, just like inconsistent cuts in distributed computing.

To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n= 22) CT articulation was examined usinga prioricodes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

Themisto facilitates the creation of documentation via three approaches: a deep-learning-based approach to generate documentation for source code, a query-based approach to retrieve online API documentation for source code, and a user prompt approach to nudge users to write documentation. We evaluated Themisto in a within-subjects experiment with 24 data science practitioners, and found that automated documentation generation techniques reduced the time for writing documentation, reminded participants to document code they would have ignored, and improved participants’ satisfaction with their computational notebook.},

To overcome these challenges, we developed the Computational Thematic Analysis Toolkit, a modular software package that supports analysis of online communities by combining aspects of reflexive thematic analysis with computational techniques. Our toolkit demonstrates how common analysis tasks like data collection, cleaning and filtering, modelling and sampling, and coding can be implemented within a single visual interface, and how that interface can encourage researchers to manage ethical and transparency considerations throughout their research process.},

In this work, we present an exhaustive literature review of colour vision deficiency compensation and subsequent findings; several prototypes with varying advantages—from well-controlled bench prototypes to less controlled but higher application portable prototypes; and a series of studies evaluating our approach starting with proving its efficacy, comparing to the state-of-the-art, and extending beyond static lab prototypes looking at real world applicability. Finally, we evaluated directions for future compensation methods for computational glasses.},

  abstract = {Team semantics is the mathematical basis of modern logics of dependence and independence. In contrast to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated not for a single assignment of values to the free variables, but on a set of such assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for a purely logical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence of data matters, but being based on sets, it does not take into account multiple occurrences of data values. It is therefore insufficient in scenarios where such multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning about probabilities and statistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams (i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors.
          In this paper we aim at a systematic development of logics of dependence and independence based on multiteam semantics. We study atomic dependency properties of finite multiteams and discuss the appropriate meaning of logical operators to extend the atomic dependencies to full-fledged logics for reasoning about dependence properties in a multiteam setting. We explore properties and expressive power of a wide spectrum of different multiteam logics and compare them to second-order logic and to logics with team semantics. In many cases the results resemble what is known in team semantics, but there are also interesting differences. While in team semantics, the combination of inclusion and exclusion dependencies leads to a logic with the full power of both independence logic and existential second-order logic, independence properties of multiteams are not definable by any combination of properties that are downwards closed or union closed and thus are strictly more powerful than inclusion-exclusion logic. We also study the relationship of logics with multiteam semantics with existential second-order logic for a specific class of metafinite structures. It turns out that inclusion-exclusion logic can be characterised in a precise sense by the Presburger fragment of this logic, but for capturing independence, we need to go beyond it and add some form of multiplication. Finally, we also consider multiteams with weights in the reals and study the expressive power of formulae by means of topological properties.},

In this article, we present and study the logic rLTL, which provides a means to formally reason about both correctness and robustness in system design. Furthermore, we identify a large fragment of rLTL for which the verification problem can be efficiently solved, i.e., verification can be done by using an automaton, recognizing the behaviors described by the rLTL formula φ, of size at most O(3 |φ |), where |φ | is the length of φ. This result improves upon the previously known bound of O(5|φ |) for rLTL verification and is closer to the LTL bound of O(2|φ |). The usefulness of this fragment is demonstrated by a number of case studies showing its practical significance in terms of expressiveness, the ability to describe robustness, and the fine-grained information that rLTL brings to the process of system verification. Moreover, these advantages come at a low computational overhead with respect to LTL verification.},

Examples are Presburger modal logic, which extends graded modal logic with linear inequalities over numbers of successors, and probabilistic modal logic with polynomial inequalities over probabilities. We establish the theoretical upper bound using a type elimination algorithm. We also provide a global caching algorithm that potentially avoids building the entire exponential-sized space of candidate states, and thus offers a basis for practical reasoning. This algorithm still involves frequent fixpoint computations; we show how these can be handled efficiently in a concrete algorithm modelled on Liu and Smolka’s linear-time fixpoint algorithm. Finally, we show that the upper complexity bound is preserved under adding nominals to the logic, i.e., in coalgebraic hybrid logic.},

On the dynamic side, we show that every single (exponential) step in the term calculus translates to a different single (exponential) step in the graphical formalism, thus capturing the original Girard’s granularity of proof-nets but on the level of terms. We also show some fundamental properties of the calculus such as confluence, strong normalization, preservation of β-strong normalization and the existence of a strong bisimulation that captures pairs of pn-terms having the same graph reduction.},

Automatic speech recognition and natural language processing create unique possibilities for analysis of oral history (OH) interviews, where otherwise the transcription and analysis of the full recording would be too time consuming. However, many oral historians note the loss of aural information when converting the speech into text, pointing out the relevance of subjective cues for a full understanding of the interviewee narrative. In this article, we explore various computational technologies for social signal processing and their potential application space in OH archives, as well as neighboring domains where qualitative studies is a frequently used method. We also highlight the latest developments in key technologies for multimedia archiving practices such as natural language processing and automatic speech recognition. We discuss the analysis of both visual (body language and facial expressions), and non-visual cues (paralinguistics, breathing, and heart rate), stating the specific challenges introduced by the characteristics of OH collections. We argue that applying social signal processing to OH archives will have a wider influence than solely OH practices, bringing benefits for various fields from humanities to computer sciences, as well as to archival sciences. Looking at human emotions and somatic reactions on extensive interview collections would give scholars from multiple fields the opportunity to focus on feelings, mood, culture, and subjective experiences expressed in these interviews on a larger scale.},

  abstract = {Scientific computing is at the core of many High-Performance Computing applications, including computational flow dynamics. Because of the utmost importance to simulate increasingly larger computational models, hardware acceleration is receiving increased attention due to its potential to maximize the performance of scientific computing. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays could accelerate scientific computing because of the possibility to fully customize the memory hierarchy important in irregular applications such as iterative linear solvers. In this article, we study the potential of using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays in High-Performance Computing because of the rapid advances in reconfigurable hardware, such as the increase in on-chip memory size, increasing number of logic cells, and the integration of High-Bandwidth Memories on board. To perform this study, we propose a novel Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication unit and an ILU0 preconditioner tightly integrated with a BiCGStab solver kernel. We integrate the developed preconditioned iterative solver in
            Flow
            from the Open Porous Media project, a state-of-the-art open source reservoir simulator. Finally, we perform a thorough evaluation of the FPGA solver kernel in both stand-alone mode and integrated in the reservoir simulator, using the NORNE field, a real-world case reservoir model using a grid with more than 10
            5
            cells and using three unknowns per cell.},

  abstract = {We present an interactive design system for knitting that allows users to create template patterns that can be fabricated using an industrial knitting machine. Our interactive design tool is novel in that it allows direct control of key knitting design axes we have identified in our formative study and does so consistently across the variations of an input parametric template geometry. This is achieved with two key technical advances. First, we present an interactive meshing tool that lets users build a coarse quadrilateral mesh that adheres to their knit design guidelines. This solution ensures consistency across the parameter space for further customization over shape variations and avoids helices, promoting knittability. Second, we lift and formalize low-level machine knitting constraints to the level of this coarse quad mesh. This enables us to not only guarantee hand- and machine-knittability, but also provides automatic design assistance through auto-completion and suggestions. We show the capabilities through a set of fabricated examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in creating a wide variety of objects and interactively exploring the space of design variations.},

  abstract = {Humans assume different production roles in a workspace. On one hand, humans design workplans to complete tasks as efficiently as possible in order to improve productivity. On the other hand, a nice workspace is essential to facilitate teamwork. In this way, workspace design and workplan design complement each other. Inspired by such observations, we propose an automatic approach to jointly design a workspace and a workplan. Taking staff properties, a space, and work equipment as input, our approach jointly optimizes a workspace and a workplan, considering performance factors such as time efficiency and congestion avoidance, as well as workload factors such as walk effort, turn effort, and workload balances. To enable exploration of design trade-offs, our approach generates a set of Pareto-optimal design solutions with strengths on different objectives, which can be adopted for different work scenarios. We apply our approach to synthesize workspaces and workplans for different workplaces such as a fast food kitchen and a supermarket. We also extend our approach to incorporate other common work considerations such as dynamic work demands and accommodating staff members with different physical capabilities. Evaluation experiments with simulations validate the efficacy of our approach for synthesizing effective workspaces and workplans.},

Prominent text-scaling algorithms, however, rely on the assumption that latent positions can be captured just by leveraging the information about word frequencies in documents under study. We challenge this traditional view and present a new, semantically aware text-scaling algorithm,

We further validate our findings through a series of experiments focused on text preprocessing and feature selection, document representation, scaling of party manifestos, and a supervised extension of our algorithm. To catalyze further research on this new branch of text-scaling methods, we release a Python implementation of

We evaluate the performance of DiffPD and observe it is 4–19 times faster compared with the standard Newton’s method in various applications including system identification, inverse design problems, trajectory optimization, and closed-loop control.

  abstract = {As a critical task in intelligent traffic systems, traffic prediction has received a large amount of attention in the past few decades. The early efforts mainly model traffic prediction as the time-series mining problem, in which the spatial dependence has been largely ignored. As the rapid development of deep learning, some attempts have been made in modeling traffic prediction as the spatio-temporal data mining problem in a road network, in which deep learning techniques can be adopted for modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously. Despite the success, the spatial and temporal dependencies are only modeled in a regionless network without considering the underlying hierarchical regional structure of the spatial nodes, which is an important structure naturally existing in the real-world road network. Apart from the challenge of modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies like the existing studies, the extra challenge caused by considering the hierarchical regional structure of the road network lies in simultaneously modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies between nodes and regions and the spatial and temporal dependencies between regions. To this end, this article proposes a new Temporal Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (TH-GAT). The main idea lies in augmenting the original road network into a region-augmented network, in which the hierarchical regional structure can be modeled. Based on the region-augmented network, the region-aware spatial dependence model and the region-aware temporal dependence model can be constructed, which are two main components of the proposed TH-GAT model. In addition, in the region-aware spatial dependence model, the graph attention network is adopted, in which the importance of a node to another node, of a node to a region, of a region to a node, and of a region to another region, can be captured automatically by means of the attention coefficients. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic datasets, and the results have confirmed the superiority of the proposed TH-GAT model.},

The computational complexity of VCSPs depends on the set of allowed cost functions in the input. Recently, the computational complexity of all VCSPs for finite sets of cost functions over finite domains has been classified. Many natural optimisation problems, however, cannot be formulated as VCSPs over a finite domain. We initiate the systematic investigation of the complexity of infinite-domain VCSPs with piecewise linear homogeneous cost functions. Such VCSPs can be solved in polynomial time if the cost functions are improved by fully symmetric fractional operations of all arities. We show this by reducing the problem to a finite-domain VCSP which can be solved using the basic linear program relaxation. It follows that VCSPs for submodular PLH cost functions can be solved in polynomial time; in fact, we show that submodular PLH functions form a maximally tractable class of PLH cost functions.},

We give a circuit characterization for FPR in terms of families of symmetric circuits with rank gates, along the lines of that for FPC given by Anderson and Dawar in 2017. This requires the development of a broad framework of circuits in which the individual gates compute functions that are not symmetric (i.e., invariant under all permutations of their inputs). This framework also necessitates the development of novel techniques to prove the equivalence of circuits and logic. Both the framework and the techniques are of greater generality than the main result.},

The programming language supports uniform sampling, addition, multiplication, and conditionals and thus is sufficiently expressive to encode Boolean and arithmetic circuits. We consider two variants of equivalence: The first one considers an interpretation over the finite field
            F
            
              q

To show decidability and a doubly exponential upper bound of the universal variant, we rely on results from algorithmic number theory and the possibility to compare local zeta functions associated to given polynomials. We then devise a general way to draw links between the universal probabilistic problems and widely studied problems on linear recurrence sequences. Finally, we study several variants of the equivalence problem, including a problem we call majority, motivated by differential privacy. We also define and provide some insights about program indistinguishability, proving that it is decidable for programs always returning 0 or 1.},

However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (

Our sequential change study revealed that participants did not recognize changes until an average of 57% morphing toward another face in small change steps.

Taking them as a collection, such social platforms can be seen as one complex network with many different types of relations, different degrees of strength for each relation, and a wide range of information on each node. In this context, social media posts made by users are reflections of the content of their own individual (or local) knowledge bases; modeling how knowledge flows over the network—or how this can possibly occur—is therefore of great interest from a knowledge representation and reasoning perspective. In this article, we provide a formal introduction to the
            network knowledge base
            model, and then focus on the problem of how a single agent’s knowledge base changes when exposed to a stream of news items coming from other members of the network. We do so by taking the classical belief revision approach of first proposing desirable properties for how such a local operation should be carried out (theoretical characterization), arriving at three different families of local operators, exploring concrete algorithms (algorithmic characterization) for two of the families, and proving properties about the relationship between the two characterizations (representation theorem). One of the most important differences between our approach and the classical models of belief revision is that in our case the input is more complex, containing additional information about each piece of information.},

  abstract = {Opioids have been shown to temporarily reduce the severity of pain when prescribed for medical purposes. However, opioid analgesics can also lead to severe adverse physical and psychological effects or even death through misuse, abuse, short- or long-term addiction, and one-time or recurrent overdose. Dynamic computational models and simulations can offer great potential to interpret the complex interaction of the drivers of the opioid crisis and assess intervention strategies. This study surveys existing studies of dynamic computational models and simulations addressing the opioid crisis and provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of dynamic computational models and simulations of the opioid crisis. This review gives a detailed analysis of existing modeling techniques, model conceptualization and formulation, and the policy interventions they suggest. It also explores the data sources they used and the study population they represented. Based on this analysis, direction and opportunities for future dynamic computational models for addressing the opioid crisis are suggested.},

In the current work, we explore synchrony in three-person teams using immersive virtual reality. Participants spent about two hours collaborating on four separate design tasks. The tracking data from the VR system allowed precise measurement of head and hand movements, facilitating calculation of synchrony. Results replicated previous work that found nonverbal synchrony in dyads in immersive VR. Moreover, we manipulated the context of the task environment, an informal garage or a traditional conference room. The environment for the task influenced synchrony, with higher levels occurring in the conference room than the garage. We also explored different methods of extending synchrony from dyads to triads, and explore the relationship of synchrony to turn taking and gaze. This paper provides theoretical insights about nonverbal synchrony and how design work functions in triads and provides suggestions for designers of VR to support good collaboration.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

We conducted ethnographic field work with small farmers and their community in Indiana and show how they are challenging "agrilogistics," defined by philosopher Timothy Morton as a strict separation of nature and culture in food production, a separation, he argues, which underlies the substantial agricultural contributions to climate change. Our ethnography led us to suggest new possibilities for design of agricultural technology that support ecological thinking and caring for more-than-human actors through visceral imaginaries, posthuman storytelling, and engaging curiosity, possibilities which may offer ways to disentangle agricultural technology from agrilogistic paradigms.?},

Given a sequence of desired stable states and the corresponding poses of the structure, we identify the topology and geometric realization of a mechanism—consisting of bars and joints—that is able to physically reproduce the desired multistable behavior. In order to solve this problem efficiently, we build on insights from minimally rigid graph theory to identify simple but effective topologies for the mechanism. We then optimize its geometric parameters, such as joint positions and bar lengths, to obtain correct transitions between the given poses. Simultaneously, we ensure adequate stability of each pose based on an effective approximate error metric related to the elastic energy Hessian of the bars in the mechanism. As demonstrated by our results, we obtain functional multistable mechanisms of manageable complexity that can be fabricated using 3D printing. Further, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method on a large number of examples in the simulation and fabricated several physical prototypes.},

In this article, we propose a promising alternative to overcome scalability limitations, based on a network of in-memory SNN accelerators, which can reduce the energy consumption by up to 150.25= when compared to a representative ASIC solution. The significant reduction in energy comes from two key aspects of the hardware design to minimize data communication overheads: (1) each node represents an in-memory SNN accelerator based on a spintronic Computational RAM array, and (2) a novel, De Bruijn graph based architecture establishes the SNN array connectivity.},

  abstract = {The traditional workflow in continuum mechanics simulations is that a geometry description —for example obtained using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) or Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools—forms the input for a mesh generator. The mesh is then used as the sole input for the finite element, finite volume, and finite difference solver, which at this point no longer has access to the original, “underlying” geometry. However, many modern techniques—for example, adaptive mesh refinement and the use of higher order geometry approximation methods—really do need information about the underlying geometry to realize their full potential. We have undertaken an exhaustive study of where typical finite element codes use geometry information, with the goal of determining what information geometry tools would have to provide. Our study shows that nearly all geometry-related needs inside the simulators can be satisfied by just two “primitives”: elementary queries posed by the simulation software to the geometry description. We then show that it is possible to provide these primitives in all of the frequently used ways in which geometries are described in common industrial workflows, and illustrate our solutions using a number of examples.},

  abstract = {Wrapping objects using ropes is a common practice in our daily life. However, it is difficult to design and tie ropes on a 3D object with complex topology and geometry features while ensuring wrapping security and easy operation. In this article, we propose to compute a rope net that can tightly wrap around various 3D shapes. Our computed rope net not only immobilizes the object but also maintains the load balance during lifting. Based on the key observation that if every knot of the net has four adjacent curve edges, then only a single rope is needed to construct the entire net. We reformulate the rope net computation problem into a constrained curve network optimization. We propose a discrete-continuous optimization approach, where the topological constraints are satisfied in the discrete phase and the geometrical goals are achieved in the continuous stage. We also develop a hoist planning to pick anchor points so that the rope net equally distributes the load during hoisting. Furthermore, we simulate the wrapping process and use it to guide the physical rope net construction process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D objects with varying geometric and topological complexity. In addition, we conduct physical experiments to demonstrate the practicability of our method.},

We first work with 1 - NBP ∧ refutations based on read-once nondeterministic branching programs. These generalize OBDD(∧, r) refutations. There are polynomial size 1 - NBP(∧) refutations of the pigeonhole principle, hence 1-NBP(∧) is strictly stronger than OBDD}(∧, r). There are also formulas that have polynomial size tree-like resolution refutations but require exponential size 1-NBP(∧) refutations. As a corollary, OBDD}(∧, r) does not simulate tree-like resolution, answering a previously open question.

Specifically, we assume that the domains of these unknown values are finite and, for a Boolean query 
            q
            , we consider the following two problems: Given as input an incomplete database 
            D
            , (a) return the number of completions of 
            D
            that satisfy

            D
            yielding a completion that satisfies 
            q

            q
            is a self-join–free conjunctive query and study the impact on the complexity of the following two restrictions: (1) every null occurs at most once in

            (what is called
            Codd tables
            ); and (2) the domain of each null is the same. Roughly speaking, we show that counting completions is much harder than counting valuations: For instance, while the latter is always in #P, we prove that the former is not in #P under some widely believed theoretical complexity assumption. Moreover, we find that both (1) and (2) can reduce the complexity of our problems. We also study the approximability of these problems and show that, while counting valuations always has a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), in most cases counting completions does not. Finally, we consider more expressive query languages and situate our problems with respect to known complexity classes.},

We show that a language inclusion problem is decidable whenever this overapproximating abstraction satisfies a completeness condition (i.e., its loss of precision causes no false alarm) and prevents infinite ascending chains (i.e., it guarantees termination of least fixpoint computations). This overapproximating abstraction of languages can be defined using quasiorder relations on words, where the abstraction gives the language of all the words “greater than or equal to” a given input word for that quasiorder. We put forward a range of such quasiorders that allow us to systematically design decision procedures for different language inclusion problems, such as regular languages into regular languages or into trace sets of one-counter nets, and context-free languages into regular languages. In the case of inclusion between regular languages, some of the induced inclusion checking procedures correspond to well-known state-of-the-art algorithms, like the so-called antichain algorithms. Finally, we provide an equivalent language inclusion checking algorithm based on a greatest fixpoint computation that relies on quotients of languages and, to the best of our knowledge, was not previously known.},

  abstract = {Rephotography is the process of recapturing the photograph of a location from the same perspective in which it was captured earlier. A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past. We have achieved good, fully automatic rephotographed results based on façade segmentation using only a single image.},

Our computations are based on an existing discrete model of isometric mappings between surfaces which for this occasion has been refined to obtain higher numerical accuracy.

  abstract = {We present a computational inverse design method for a new class of surface-based inflatable structure. Our deployable structures are fabricated by fusing together two layers of inextensible sheet material along carefully selected curves. The fusing curves form a network of tubular channels that can be inflated with air or other fluids. When fully inflated, the initially flat surface assumes a programmed double-curved shape and becomes stiff and load-bearing. We present a method that solves for the layout of air channels that, when inflated, best approximate a given input design. For this purpose, we integrate a forward simulation method for inflation with a gradient-based optimization algorithm that continuously adapts the geometry of the air channels to improve the design objectives. To initialize this non-linear optimization, we propose a novel surface flattening algorithm. When a channel is inflated, it approximately maintains its length, but contracts transversally to its main direction. Our algorithm approximates this deformation behavior by computing a mapping from the 3D design surface to the plane that allows for anisotropic metric scaling within the bounds realizable by the physical system. We show a wide variety of inflatable designs and fabricate several prototypes to validate our approach and highlight potential applications.},

  abstract = {The edges of an image contains rich visual cognitive cues. However, the edge information of a natural scene usually is only a set of disorganized unorganized pixels for a computer. In psychology, the phenomenon of quickly perceiving global information from a complex pattern is called the global precedence effect (GPE). For example, when one observes the edge map of an image, some contours seem to automatically “pop out” from the complex background. This is a manifestation of GPE on edge information and is called global contour precedence (GCP). The primary visual cortex (V1) is closely related to the processing of edges. In this article, a neural computational model to simulate GCP based on the mechanisms of V1 is presented. There are three layers in the proposed model: the representation of line segments, organization of edges, and perception of global contours. In experiments, the ability to group edges is tested on the public dataset BSDS500. The results show that the grouping performance, robustness, and time cost of the proposed model are superior to those of other methods. In addition, the outputs of the proposed model can also be applied to the generation of object proposals, which indicates that the proposed model can contribute significantly to high-level visual tasks.},

Weingarten surfaces are characterized by a functional relation between their principal curvatures that implicitly defines approximate local congruences on the surface. These symmetries can be exploited to simplify surface paneling of double-curved architectural skins through mold re-use.
          We present an optimization approach to find a Weingarten surface that is close to a given input design. Leveraging insights from differential geometry, our method aligns curvature isolines of the surface in order to contract the curvature diagram from a 2D region into a 1D curve. The unknown functional curvature relation then emerges as the result of the optimization. We show how a robust and efficient numerical shape approximation method can be implemented using a guided projection approach on a high-order B-spline representation. This algorithm is applied in several design studies to illustrate how Weingarten surfaces define a versatile shape space for fabrication-aware exploration in freeform architecture. Our optimization algorithm provides the first practical tool to compute general Weingarten surfaces with arbitrary curvature relation, thus enabling new investigations into a rich, but as of yet largely unexplored class of surfaces.},

            optimal transport. By combining this design space with differentiable simulation and control, we can efficiently optimize a soft underwater swimmer's performance with fewer simulations than baseline methods.

Specifically, we leverage the trajectory, collective behavior, and density of swarm robots to generate motion that implicitly guides people’s attention toward the goal of the robots. Through online evaluations, we compared different types of intent-expressive motions both in terms of legibility as well as glanceability, a measure we introduce to gauge an observer’s ability to predict robots’ intent pre-attentively. The results show that the collective behavior-based motion has the best legibility performance overall, whereas, for glanceability, trajectory-based legible motion is most effective. These results suggest that the optimal solution may involve a combination of these legibility cues based on the scenario and the desired properties of the motion.},

  abstract = {A consumer-dependent (business-to-consumer) organization tends to present itself as possessing a set of human qualities, which is termed the
            brand personality
            of the company. The perception is impressed upon the consumer through the content, be it in the form of advertisement, blogs, or magazines, produced by the organization. A consistent brand will generate trust and retain customers over time as they develop an affinity toward regularity and common patterns. However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content that needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles that are not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making a web article more consistent with the company’s brand personality.},

Petri-PDL is a logical language that combines these two approaches: it is a dynamic logic where programs are replaced by Petri Nets. In this work we present a clausal resolution-based calculus for Petri-PDL. Given a Petri-PDL formula, we show how to obtain its translation into a normal form to which a set of resolution-based inference rules are applied. We show that the resulting calculus is sound, complete, and terminating. Some examples of the application of the method are also given.},

            , which for every player will either satisfy or fail to satisfy their goal. Players are assumed to act strategically, taking into account the goals of other players, in an attempt to bring about computations satisfying their goal. In this setting, we apply the standard game-theoretic concept of (pure) Nash equilibria. The (possibly empty) set of Nash equilibria of an iterated Boolean game can be understood as inducing a set of computations, each computation representing one way the system could evolve if players chose strategies that together constitute a Nash equilibrium. Such a set of equilibrium computations expresses a temporal property—which may or may not be expressible within a particular
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            fragment. The new notion of expressiveness that we formally define and investigate is then as follows:
            
              What temporal properties are characterised by the Nash equilibria of games in which agent goals are expressed in specific fragments of 
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            ? We formally define and investigate this notion of expressiveness for a range of
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            fragments. For example, a very natural question is the following:
            
              Suppose we have an iterated Boolean game in which every goal is represented using a particular fragment

              : is it then always the case that the equilibria of the game can be characterised within

This is a very natural extension that has not been studied so far. We show that the restriction without the separating implication can be solved in polynomial space by using an appropriate abstraction for memory states, whereas the full extension is shown undecidable by reduction from first-order separation logic. Many variants of the logic and fragments are also investigated from the computational point of view when ls is added, providing numerous results about adding reachability predicates to quantifier-free separation logic.},

In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the “typical” questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2--10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.},

Gender is a regularly considered aspect of identity, with extensive work documenting and exploring gendered experiences and designs with the aim of addressing inequalities in, or through, design. Recent work has questioned the way that we conceptualise and "measure" gender, advocating more nuanced classificatory schemes to avoid silencing or obscuring trans and/or non-binary experiences. Building on and extending this research, our work examines how gender is conceptualised more broadly. Drawing from a range of theoretical perspectives in gender studies, feminist and postcolonial theory, we argue for the treatment of gender as "multiplicitous" when we conceptualise and interpret research, in order to avoid unintentionally perpetuating silencing and inequality even as we work to tackle it. Illustrating our argument with examples from both within and without CSCW, we suggest both new research directions for CSCW scholars inquiring into gender, and sensitising questions that scholars can use when constructing and evaluating studies.},

  abstract = {A growing number of people are using catch-up TV services rather than watching simultaneously with other audience members at the time of broadcast. However, computational support for such catching-up users has not been well explored. In particular, we are observing an emerging phenomenon in online media consumption experiences in which speculation plays a vital role. As the phenomenon of speculation implicitly assumes simultaneity in media consumption, there is a gap for catching-up users, who cannot directly appreciate the consumption experiences. This conversely suggests that there is potential for computational support to enhance the consumption experiences of catching-up users. Accordingly, we conducted a series of studies to pave the way for developing computational support for catching-up users. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how people are engaging with speculation during media consumption. As a result, we discovered the distinctive aspects of speculation-based consumption experiences in contrast to social viewing experiences sharing immediate reactions that have been discussed in previous studies. We then designed two prototypes for supporting catching-up users based on our quantitative analysis of Twitter data in regard to reaction- and speculation-based media consumption. Lastly, we evaluated the prototypes in a user experiment and, based on its results, discussed ways to empower catching-up users with computational supports in response to recent transformations in media consumption.},

  abstract = {Last November (2020) the SIGCAS executive board conducted a survey of SIGCAS members to get a picture of who we are, where we come from, what we're interested in, and what the membership would like to see the board do to better fulfill its mission. Based on discussions with the executive board, SIGCAS Vice Chair Lisa Kaczmarczyk implemented the survey using Survey Monkey. As with all surveys one can't get all the information one would like and the more information one tries to obtain, the fewer people are likely to supply it. We settled on eight questions and we received input from 68 people, about 23% of our membership (then just under 300 people---now slightly over).
          What follows is a presentation of the survey results along with some commentary. How I interpret the data and what I think ought to (or could) be done with the data might not be how you'd interpret the data and think about what ought to be done. And that's a good discussion to have! At any rate, the responses that we've received represent a valuable part of our collective intelligence, consciousness, and visions for the future. The hope is that these will inform out work going forward.
          Please note that I'm not doing any professional analysis since I'm not qualified to do that. I also suspect that the wisdom we can glean wouldn't be found via additional number crunching. And I would also add that there are dangers to reading too much into survey data. As a precaution I have asked the other board members to take a look at this article so I don't get anything terribly wrong.
          Just a reminder that the data we have doesn't necessarily reflect the totality of what our entire membership would provide. (Although, as one somewhat validating figure, the percentage of people outside of North America on our roster is about the same as the percentage of people who told us they were from outside North America on the survey, 72%.) Also, I'm trying to avoid the temptation to comment on everything. There's too much material for that. And, obviously, there are too many suggestions and ideas out there for SIGCAS to move on all of them. But based on these responses a multitude of useful information is now available and it should help lead us into productive discussions and actions.},

Today, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. This provides a unique opportunity for researchers and health practitioners to proactively identify linguistic markers or patterns that correlate with mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or suicide behaviour. This survey describes and reviews the approaches that have been proposed for mental state assessment and identification of disorders using online digital records. The presented studies are organised according to the assessment technology and the feature extraction process conducted. We also present a series of studies which explore different aspects of the language and behaviour of individuals suffering from mental disorders, and discuss various aspects related to the development of experimental frameworks. Furthermore, ethical considerations regarding the treatment of individuals’ data are outlined. The main contributions of this survey are a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches for online mental state assessment on social media, a structured categorisation of the methods according to their design principles, lessons learnt over the years and a discussion on possible avenues for future research.},

However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.},

  abstract = {Emerging memcapacitive nanoscale devices have the potential to perform computations in new ways. In this article, we systematically study, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the computational capacity of complex memcapacitive networks, which function as reservoirs inreservoir computing,one of the brain-inspired computing architectures. Memcapacitive networks are composed of memcapacitive devices randomly connected through nanowires. Previous studies have shown that both regular and random reservoirs provide sufficient dynamics to perform simple tasks. How do complex memcapacitive networks illustrate their computational capability, and what are the topological structures of memcapacitive networks that solve complex tasks with efficiency? Studies show that small-world power-law (SWPL) networks offer an ideal trade-off between the communication properties and the wiring cost of networks. In this study, we illustrate the computing nature of SWPL memcapacitive reservoirs by exploring the two essential properties: fading memory and linear separation through measurements of kernel quality. Compared to ideal reservoirs, nanowire memcapacitive reservoirs had a better dynamic response and improved their performance by 4.67% on three tasks: MNIST, Isolated Spoken Digits, and CIFAR-10. On the same three tasks, compared to memristive reservoirs, nanowire memcapacitive reservoirs achieved comparable performance with much less power, on average, about 99× , 17×, and 277×, respectively. Simulation results of the topological transformation of memcapacitive networks reveal that that topological structures of the memcapacitive SWPL reservoirs did not affect their performance but significantly contributed to the wiring cost and the power consumption of the systems. The minimum trade-off between the wiring cost and the power consumption occurred at different network settings ofαandβ: 4.5 and 0.61 forBiolekreservoirs, 2.7 and 1.0 forMohamedreservoirs, and 3.0 and 1.0 forNajemreservoirs. The results of our research illustrate the computational capacity of complex memcapacitive networks as reservoirs in reservoir computing. Such memcapacitive networks with an SWPL topology are energy-efficient systems that are suitable for low-power applications such as mobile devices and the Internet of Things.},

As a lawyer, who went through the initiating ritual of law school, sitting for the bar, and litigating cases, I have allegedly gained this skill called "thinking like a lawyer." As I reflect upon how the experience of becoming a lawyer and practicing law changed my thinking, a few things come to mind. First, I am subconsciously scanning for risks and liability everywhere, fabricating fictitious lawsuits in my head that might occur. Second, I care a lot about words, what exactly was said, and the meaning and truthfulness of the assertion when a strict vs. lenient interpretation of those words is applied. Third, I have the ability to navigate complex systems and to guide others less familiar with those systems through the maze. Finally, I have acquired a sobering view of what the legal system does and does not do, its promise and its shortcomings.},

The problem is known to be NP-hard and in PSPACE, and this article establishes its PSPACE-completeness. Next, string avoidability over the binary alphabet is interpreted as a version of conjunctive normal form satisfiability problem, where each clause has infinitely many shifted variants. Non-satisfiability of these formulas can be proved using variants of classical propositional proof systems, augmented with derivation rules for shifting proof lines (such as clauses, inequalities, polynomials, etc.). First, it is proved that there is a particular formula that has a short refutation in Resolution with a shift rule but requires classical proofs of exponential size. At the same time, it is shown that exponential lower bounds for classical proof systems can be translated for their shifted versions. Finally, it is shown that superpolynomial lower bounds on the size of shifted proofs would separate NP from PSPACE; a connection to lower bounds on circuit complexity is also established.},

We focus on a 16-month, full-scale media architecture design project and zero in on seven of its component events, and use design-space schemas to shed light on the dynamics of the design space with respect to informing and filtering the design space. Our concluding contribution is to propose design-space thinking as a sub-discipline of design research. We argue that this research perspective serves to address the creative aspects of the design process, the generative potential of design-space thinking, and the tools that support design-space thinking and research.},

In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. We find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction.

  abstract = {Dependently typed programming languages and proof assistants such as Agda and Coq rely on computation to automatically simplify expressions during type checking. To overcome the lack of certain programming primitives or logical principles in those systems, it is common to appeal to axioms to postulate their existence. However, one can only postulate the bare existence of an axiom, not its computational behaviour. Instead, users are forced to postulate equality proofs and appeal to them explicitly to simplify expressions, making axioms dramatically more complicated to work with than built-in primitives. On the other hand, the equality reflection rule from extensional type theory solves these problems by collapsing computation and equality, at the cost of having no practical type checking algorithm. This paper introduces Rewriting Type Theory (RTT), a type theory where it is possible to add computational assumptions in the form of rewrite rules. Rewrite rules go beyond the computational capabilities of intensional type theory, but in contrast to extensional type theory, they are applied automatically so type checking does not require input from the user. To ensure type soundness of RTT—as well as effective type checking—we provide a framework where confluence of user-defined rewrite rules can be checked modularly and automatically, and where adding new rewrite rules is guaranteed to preserve subject reduction. The properties of RTT have been formally verified using the MetaCoq framework and an implementation of rewrite rules is already available in the Agda proof assistant.},

  abstract = {Compact closed categories include objects representing higher-order functions and are well-established as models of linear logic, concurrency, and quantum computing. We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types, a negative type, and a dual to product types, a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics, we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that ``reverses execution flow'' and a fractional type represents a computational effect that ``garbage collects'' particular values or throws exceptions.Specifically, we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types, specify an operational semantics for each extension, and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics, most of its meta-theoretic properties, and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.},

          The positive result is the decidability of the emptiness problem for the case of Büchi acceptance condition. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we do not extend the classical solution for solving the emptiness problem of alternating automata, which first constructs an equivalent non-deterministic automaton. Instead, we directly construct an emptiness game making use of imperfect information.
          The negative result is the undecidability of the emptiness problem for the case of co-Büchi acceptance condition. This result has two direct consequences: the undecidability of monadic second-order logic extended with the qualitative path-measure quantifier and the undecidability of the emptiness problem for alternating tree automata with non-zero semantics, a recently introduced probabilistic model of alternating tree automata.},

To do this, we adopt a qualitative methodology based on the study of 10 cases, using the WarVG-A (War video game evaluation) instrument to perform the content analysis, based on six dimensions (cognitive, personal-attitudinal, ethical, logical, argumentative, and expressive-communicative) with different indicators and categories. The results of the analysis indicate that these primary games terrorist tactics and historical adaptation, addressing war from a critical approach. Most evidence ethical dilemmas such as child soldiers, the economics of war (arms sales and conflict perpetuation). Economic and geo-political interests are the engines that drive wars, considered inevitable to defend themselves. The stereotypes that abound are gender and ethnic warmongers represented by photorealistic and cinematographic aesthetics. Only four of the selected playful artifacts can identify tools capable of driving critical thinking, inviting players to reflect on war from a more realistic position and emotionally involving them.

  abstract = {This article deals with advanced notions of equivalence between nonmonotonic logic programs under the answer-set semantics, a topic of considerable interest, because such notions form the basis for program verification and are useful for program optimisation, debugging, and modular programming. In fact, there is extensive research in answer-set programming (ASP) dealing with different notions of equivalence between programs. Prominent among these notions is
            uniform equivalence
            , which checks whether two programs have the same semantics when joined with an arbitrary set of facts. In this article, we study a family of more fine-grained versions of uniform equivalence, viz.
            relativised uniform equivalence with projection
            , which extends standard uniform equivalence in terms of two additional parameters: one for specifying the input alphabet and one for specifying the output alphabet for programs. In particular, the second parameter is used for
            projecting
            answer sets to a set of designated output atoms. Answer-set projection, in particular, allows to compare programs that make use of different auxiliary atoms, which is important for practical programming aspects. We introduce novel semantic characterisations for the program correspondence problems under consideration and analyse their computational complexity. In the general case, deciding these problems lies on the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Therefore, this task cannot be efficiently reduced to propositional answer-set programs itself (under the usual complexity-theoretic assumptions). However, reductions to
            quantified Boolean formulas
            (QBFs) are feasible. Indeed, we provide efficient (in fact, linear-time constructible) reductions to QBFs and discuss simplifications for certain special cases. These QBF reductions yield the basis for a prototype implementation, the system cc ⊤, for deciding correspondence problems by using off-the-shelf QBF solvers. We discuss an application of cc ⊤ for verifying the correctness of solutions by students drawn from a laboratory course on logic programming and knowledge representation at the Technische Universität Wien, employing relativised uniform equivalence with projection as the underlying program correspondence notion.},

  abstract = {Cold bent glass is a promising and cost-efficient method for realizing doubly curved glass façades. They are produced by attaching planar glass sheets to curved frames and must keep the occurring stress within safe limits. However, it is very challenging to navigate the design space of cold bent glass panels because of the fragility of the material, which impedes the form finding for practically feasible and aesthetically pleasing cold bent glass façades. We propose an interactive, data-driven approach for designing cold bent glass façades that can be seamlessly integrated into a typical architectural design pipeline. Our method allows non-expert users to interactively edit a parametric surface while providing real-time feedback on the deformed shape and maximum stress of cold bent glass panels. The designs are automatically refined to minimize several fairness criteria, while maximal stresses are kept within glass limits. We achieve interactive frame rates by using a differentiable Mixture Density Network trained from more than a million simulations. Given a curved boundary, our regression model is capable of handling multistable configurations and accurately predicting the equilibrium shape of the panel and its corresponding maximal stress. We show that the predictions are highly accurate and validate our results with a physical realization of a cold bent glass surface.},

Many, if not most, of these attempts are based on preferential extensions of description logics, with a significant number of these, in turn, following the so-called KLM approach to defeasible reasoning initially advocated for propositional logic by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor. Each of these attempts has its own aim of investigating particular constructions and variants of the (KLM-style) preferential approach. Here our aim is to provide a comprehensive study of the formal foundations of preferential defeasible reasoning for description logics in the KLM tradition.We start by investigating a notion ofdefeasible subsumptionin the spirit of defeasible conditionals as studied by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor in the propositional case. In particular, we consider a natural and intuitive semantics for defeasible subsumption, and we investigate KLM-style syntactic properties for bothpreferentialandrationalsubsumption. Our contribution includes two representation results linking our semantic constructions to the set of preferential and rational properties considered. Besides showing that our semantics is appropriate, these results pave the way for more effective decision procedures for defeasible reasoning in description logics. Indeed, we also analyse the problem of non-monotonic reasoning in description logics at the level ofentailmentand present an algorithm for the computation ofrational closureof a defeasible knowledge base. Importantly, our algorithm relies completely on classical entailment and shows that the computational complexity of reasoning over defeasible knowledge bases is no worse than that of reasoning in the underlying classical DLALC.},

This is further compounded by the fact that decision-making actors are rarely security experts and may have an incomplete understanding of the security that the organisation currently has in place. They must contend with a multitude of possible security options that they may only partially understand. This challenge is met by decision makers’
            risk thinking
            —their strategies for identifying risks, assessing their severity, and prioritising responses. We study the risk thinking strategies employed by teams of participants in an existing dataset derived from a tabletop cyber-physical systems security game.  Our analysis identifies four

The logic, which represents the logical counterpart of history-preserving bisimilarity, is naturally interpreted over event structures or any formalism that can be given a causal semantics, like Petri nets. It includes least and greatest fixpoint operators and thus it can express properties of infinite computations. Since the event structure associated with a system is typically infinite (even if the system is finite state), already the decidability of model-checking is non-trivial. We first develop a local model-checking technique based on a tableau system, for which, over a class of event structures satisfying a suitable regularity condition, referred to as strong regularity, we prove termination, soundness, and completeness. The tableau system allows for a clean and intuitive proof of decidability, but a direct implementation of the procedure can be extremely inefficient. For easing the development of a more efficient model-checking technique, we move to an automata-theoretic framework. Given a formula and a strongly regular event structure, we show how to construct a parity tree automaton whose language is non-empty if and only if the event structure satisfies the formula. The automaton is usually infinite. We discuss how it can be quotiented to an equivalent finite automaton, where emptiness can be checked effectively. To show the applicability of the approach, we discuss how it instantiates to finite safe Petri nets, providing also a corresponding proof-of-concept model-checking tool.},

In this article, we propose a new generalization of strong equivalence (SE) that takes the visibility of atoms into account and we characterize it in terms of appropriately revised SE-models. Our design resembles (relativized) strong equivalence but is substantially different due to adopting a strict one-to-one correspondence of models from the notion of visible equivalence. We additionally tailor the characterization for more convenient use with positive programs and provide formal tools to exploit the tailored version also in the case of some programs that use negation. We illustrate the use of visible strong equivalence and the characterizations in showing the correctness of program transformations that make use of atom visibility. Moreover, we present a translation that enables us to automate the task of verifying visible strong equivalence for particular fragments of answer-set programs. We experimentally study the efficiency of verification when the goal is to check whether an extended rule is visibly strongly equivalent to its normalization, i.e., a subprogram expressing the original rule in terms of normal rules only. In the process, we verify the outputs of several real implementations of normalization schemes on a considerable number of input rules.},

Decidability results are known for certain restricted logics with respect to these semantics, subject to a variety of restrictions that are either unexplained or involve a longstanding unsolved mathematical problem. We show that mild generalizations of the known decidable cases suffice to render the model checking problem definitively undecidable. In particular, for the synchronous perfect recall semantics, a generalization from temporal operators with finite reach to operators with infinite reach renders model checking undecidable. The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic second-order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable, except on a set of measure zero. We show that two distinct extensions of this logic make model checking undecidable. One of these involves polynomial combinations of probability terms, the other involves monadic second-order quantification into the scope of probability operators. These results explain some of the restrictions in previous work.},

Formulating such a problem relies on FEniCS domain-specific language and the representation of convex functions, in particular, non-smooth ones, in the conic programming framework. The discrete formulation of the corresponding optimization problems hinges on the finite element discretization capabilities offered by FEniCS, while their numerical resolution is carried out by the interior-point solver Mosek. Through various illustrative examples, we show that convex optimization problems can be formulated using only a few lines of code, discretized in a very simple manner, and solved extremely efficiently.},

  abstract = {Laser irradiation induces colors on some industrially important materials, such as stainless steel and titanium. It is however challenging to find marking configurations that create colorful, high-resolution images. The brute-force solution to the
            gamut exploration
            problem does not scale with the high-dimensional design space of laser marking. Moreover, there exists no color reproduction workflow capable of reproducing color images with laser marking. Here, we propose a measurement-based, data-driven performance space exploration of the color laser marking process. We formulate this exploration as a search for the Pareto optimal solutions to a multi-objective optimization and solve it using an evolutionary algorithm. The explored set of diverse colors is then utilized to mark high-quality, full-color images.},

  abstract = {We propose an optimization-driven approach for automated, physics-based pattern design for tight-fitting clothing. Designing such clothing poses particular challenges since large nonlinear deformations, tight contact between cloth and body, and body deformations have to be accounted for. To address these challenges, we develop a computational model based on an embedding of the two-dimensional cloth mesh in the surface of the three-dimensional body mesh. Our
            Lagrangian-on-Lagrangian
            approach eliminates contact handling while coupling cloth and body. Building on this model, we develop a physics-driven optimization method based on sensitivity analysis that automatically computes optimal patterns according to design objectives encoding body shape, pressure distribution, seam traction, and other criteria. We demonstrate our approach by generating personalized patterns for various body shapes and a diverse set of garments with complex pattern layouts.},

  abstract = {Supporting inductive reasoning is an essential component is any framework of use in computer science. To do so, the logical framework must extend that of first-order logic. Transitive closure logic is a known extension of first-order logic that is particularly straightforward to automate. While other extensions of first-order logic with inductive definitions are
            a priori
            parametrized by a set of inductive definitions, the addition of a single transitive closure operator has the advantage of uniformly capturing all finitary inductive definitions. To further improve the reasoning techniques for transitive closure logic, we here present an
            infinitary
            proof system for it, which is an
            infinite descent
            –style counterpart to the existing (explicit induction) proof system for the logic. We show that the infinitary system is complete for the standard semantics and subsumes the explicit system. Moreover, the uniformity of the transitive closure operator allows semantically meaningful complete restrictions to be defined using simple syntactic criteria. Consequently, the restriction to regular infinitary (i.e., 
            cyclic

  abstract = {In contrast to qualitative linear temporal logics, which can be used to state that some property will eventually be satisfied, metric temporal logics allow us to formulate constraints on how long it may take until the property is satisfied. While most of the work on combining description logics (DLs) with temporal logics has concentrated on qualitative temporal logics, there is a growing interest in extending this work to the quantitative case. In this article, we complement existing results on the combination of DLs with metric temporal logics by introducing
            interval-rigid
            concept and role names. Elements included in an interval-rigid concept or role name are required to stay in it for some specified amount of time. We investigate several combinations of (metric) temporal logics with

            ℒ
            C
            by either allowing temporal operators only on the level of axioms or also applying them to concepts. In contrast to most existing work on the topic, we consider a timeline based on the integers and also allow assertional axioms. We show that the worst-case complexity does not increase beyond the previously known bound of 2-E

Following this, a finite-element discretization of both procedures is discussed, an algorithm for running the flow is given, and an application to mesh editing is presented.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant source of suffering, disability and societal cost in the US. However, while the ability to detect a person's risk for developing persistent pain is desirable for timely assessment, management, treatment, and reduced health care costs---no objective measure to detect clinical pain intensity exist. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have deployed clinical decision- making and assessment tools to enhance pain risk detection across core social and clinical domains. Yet, risk assessment models are only as "good" as the data they are based on. Thus, ensuring fairness is also a critical component of equitable care in both the short and long term. This paper takes an intersectional and public health approach to AI fairness in the context of pain and invisible disability, suggesting that computational ethnography is a multimodal and participatory real-world data (RWD) methodology that can be used to enhance the curation of intersectional knowledge bases, thereby expanding existing boundaries of AI fairness in terms of inclusiveness and transparency for pain and invisible disability use cases.},

Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, combined with nonassociative floating point addition, makes reproducibility challenging even for summation, or operations like the BLAS. We describe a “reproducible accumulator” data structure (the “binned number”) and associated algorithms to reproducibly sum binary floating point numbers, independent of summation order. We use a subset of the IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008 and bitwise operations on the standard representations in memory. Our approach requires only one read-only pass over the data, and one reduction in parallel, using a 6-word reproducible accumulator (more words can be used for higher accuracy), enabling standard tiling optimization techniques. Summing
            n
            words with a 6-word reproducible accumulator requires approximately 9

            (FQA), which assumes that the underlying world is finite and thus only considers the

The major known decidable cases of FQA derive from the following: the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which can express referential constraints (data in one place points to data in another) but cannot express number restrictions such as functional dependencies; and the guarded fragment with number restrictions but on a signature of arity only two. In this article, we give the first decidability results for FQA that combine both referential constraints and number restrictions for arbitrary signatures: We show that, for unary inclusion dependencies and functional dependencies, the finiteness assumption of FQA can be lifted up to taking the finite implication closure of the dependencies. Our result relies on new techniques to construct finite universal models of such constraints for any bound on the maximal query size.},

It traces this history, and illustrates it through several examples, from early ideas based on mutual exclusion (which was initially introduced to access shared physical resources), passing through consensus and concurrent objects (which are immaterial data), until today distributed ledgers. A discussion is also presented, which addresses the limits that this approach encounters, related to fault-tolerance, performance, and inherently concurrent problems.},

These linkages provide us a unique mechanism to predict one set of patterns from other related patterns. Unlike conventional biometrics, EEG biometrics are hard to spoof using standard presentation attack methods, given the intrinsic liveness resulting from the bounded randomness of EEG signals specific to an individual. In this article, we propose a novel attack on the EEG-based authentication systems by investigating and leveraging the strong correlation between hand movements and brain signals captured through the motion sensors on a smartwatch and the wearable EEG headset, respectively. Based on this technique, we can successfully estimate the user’s EEG signals from the stolen hand movement data while the user was typing on the keyboard. Our attack results on the EEG biometric authentication system show an increase in the mean equal error rates of the classifiers by between 180% and 360% based on a dataset of 59 users. In summary, our pilot study calls for a rethinking of EEG-based authentication mechanisms from the perspective of unique vulnerabilities, particularly for multimodal biometric systems involving a variety of wearable or mobile devices.},

Afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. In two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world.

In a testing experiment, the tester (or the environment) controls the inputs, and the system under test controls the outputs. The standard models and refinement relations of CSP, however, do not differentiate inputs and outputs and are not, therefore, entirely suitable for testing. Here, we consider an alphabet of events partitioned into inputs and outputs, and we present a novel refusal-testing model for CSP with a notion of input-output refusal-traces refinement. We compare that with the ioco relation often used in testing, and we find that it is more widely applicable and stronger. This means that mistakes found using traditional ioco testing do indicate mistakes in the development. Finally, we provide a CSP testing theory that takes into account inputs and outputs. With our theory, it becomes feasible to develop techniques and tools for automatic generation of realistic and sound tests from CSP models. Our work reconciles the normally disparate areas of refinement and (formal) testing by identifying how ioco testing can be used to inform refinement-based results and vice-versa.},

Our approach introduces a novel class of energies based on a representation of cross fields in the spherical harmonic basis. We provide theoretical analysis of these energies in the smooth setting, showing that they penalize deviations from surface creases while otherwise promoting intrinsically smooth fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to quad meshing and include an extensive benchmark comparing our fields to other automatic approaches for generating feature-aligned cross fields on triangle meshes.},

  abstract = {Timed Automata (TA) is de facto a standard modelling formalism to represent systems when the interest is the analysis of their behaviour as time progresses. This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the behaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if efficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily configurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed Automata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication procedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second, they usually do not support the Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and rely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is specified, which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not easily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in different contexts.
          This article presents a novel technique to perform model checking of Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The technique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an intermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula, which is verified through an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible, since the intermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA constructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is not bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be verified using different procedures.},

As the era of Moore’s law draws to a close, many new non–von Neumann processors are emerging as potential computational accelerators, including those based on the principles of neuromorphic computing, tensor algebra, and quantum information. While development of these new processors is continuing to mature, the potential impact on accelerated computing is anticipated to be profound. We discuss how different processing models can advance computing in key scientific paradigms: machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications. This also hints at the infrastructure needed to integrate next-generation processing units into future high-performance computing systems.},

These fragments are defined by controlling the polarity of the occurrences of separating implications, as well as the occurrences of universally quantified variables within their scope. These decidability results have natural applications in program verification, as they allow to automatically prove lemmas that occur in, e.g., entailment checking between inductively defined predicates and validity checking of Hoare triples expressing partial correctness conditions.},

The problem of verifying whether a formula of these logics is true on a given structure is considered intractable in general, but it does become tractable on interesting classes of structures, such as on classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded treewidth. In this article, we continue this line of research and study model-checking for first- and monadic second-order logic in the presence of an ordering on the input structure. We do so in two settings: the general ordered case, where the input structures are equipped with a fixed order or successor relation, and the order-invariant case, where the formulas may resort to an ordering, but their truth must be independent of the particular choice of order. In the first setting we show very strong intractability results for most interesting classes of structures. In contrast, in the order-invariant case we obtain tractability results for order-invariant monadic second-order formulas on the same classes of graphs as in the unordered case. For first-order logic, we obtain tractability of successor-invariant formulas on classes whose Gaifman graphs have bounded expansion. Furthermore, we show that model-checking for order-invariant first-order formulas is tractable on coloured posets of bounded width.},

            , an edited collection by Rich Rice and Kirk St. Amant, takes a kairotic approach and aims to offer a foundation for addressing the technical issues related to online writing in terms of composition and rhetoric. To address the new audience, the editors believe writers need to rethink their writing contexts, reassess their perception of global communication, and reconsider their writing methods to create content for online media. To practically implement these key issues, this book proposes "3Cs"---

  abstract = {The frequent usage of figurative language on online social networks, especially on Twitter, has the potential to mislead traditional sentiment analysis and recommender systems. Due to the extensive use of slangs, bashes, flames, and non-literal texts, tweets are a great source of figurative language, such as sarcasm, irony, metaphor, simile, hyperbole, humor, and satire. Starting with a brief introduction of figurative language and its various categories, this article presents an in-depth survey of the state-of-the-art techniques for computational detection of seven different figurative language categories, mainly on Twitter. For each figurative language category, we present details about the characterizing features, datasets, and state-of-the-art computational detection approaches. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions of research for each figurative language category.},

Since game computational sophistication (GCS) has been used as a proxy for a student’s engagement in CL we build on their model to more completely describe the relationship between different types of building blocks of computer games and GCS. In doing so, we present a single quantitative measurement for GCS. Our model, called
            GCS 2.0
            , has face validity for 39 games, each programmed by a pair of middle school children. We choose four of these games, two with high GCS and two with low GCS, and discuss the computational building blocks found in each game. We do this to help the reader better understand our measurement of GCS and its relationship to CL.},

  abstract = {Parquetry is the art and craft of decorating a surface with a pattern of differently colored veneers of wood, stone, or other materials. Traditionally, the process of designing and making parquetry has been driven by color, using the texture found in real wood only for stylization or as a decorative effect. Here, we introduce a computational pipeline that draws from the rich natural structure of strongly textured real-world veneers as a source of detail to approximate a target image as faithfully as possible using a manageable number of parts. This challenge is closely related to the established problems of patch-based image synthesis and stylization in some ways, but fundamentally different in others. Most importantly, the limited availability of resources (any piece of wood can only be used once) turns the relatively simple problem of finding the right piece for the target location into the combinatorial problem of finding optimal parts while avoiding resource collisions. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently solves an approximation to the problem. It further addresses challenges like gamut mapping, feature characterization, and the search for fabricable cuts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by fabricating a selection of pieces of parquetry from different kinds of unstained wood veneer.},

  abstract = {A liquid type is an ordinary Hindley-Milner type annotated with a logical predicate that states the properties satisfied by the elements of that type. Liquid types are a powerful tool for program verification, as programmers can use them to specify pre- and post conditions of their programs, whereas the predicates of intermediate variables and auxiliary functions are inferred automatically. Type inference is feasible in this context, as the logical predicates within liquid types are constrained to a quantifier-free logic to maintain decidability.
          In this article, we extend liquid types by allowing them to contain quantified properties on arrays so that they can be used to infer invariants on array-related programs (e.g., implementations of sorting algorithms). Although quantified logic is, in general, undecidable, we restrict properties on arrays to a decidable subset introduced by Bradley et al. We describe in detail the extended type system, the verification condition generator, and the iterative weakening algorithm for inferring invariants. After proving the correctness and completeness of these two algorithms, we apply them to find invariants on a set of algorithms involving array manipulations.},

Our work proves two results of the same kind, one for the alternation-free or
            noetherian
            fragment μ

            ML of μML on the modal side and one for WMSO, weak monadic second-order logic, on the second-order side. In the setting of binary trees, with explicit functions accessing the left and right successor of a node, it was known that WMSO is equivalent to the appropriate version of alternation-free μ-calculus. Our analysis shows that the picture changes radically once we consider, as Janin and Walukiewicz did, the standard modal μ-calculus, interpreted over arbitrary LTSs.
          
          
            The first theorem that we prove is that, over LTSs, μ
            
              N
            
            ML is equivalent modulo bisimilarity to
            noetherian
            MSO (NMSO), a newly introduced variant of SMSO where second-order quantification ranges over “conversely well-founded” subsets only. Our second theorem starts from WMSO and proves it equivalent modulo bisimilarity to a fragment of μ
            
              N
            
            ML defined by a notion of continuity. Analogously to Janin and Walukiewicz’s result, our proofs are automata-theoretic in nature: As another contribution, we introduce classes of parity automata characterising the expressiveness of WMSO and NMSO (on tree models) and of μ

It is known that model checking one-counter machines against formulas of Freeze LTL (FLTL), a strict fragment of TPTL, is undecidable. We prove that in our setting, MTL is strictly less expressive than TPTL, and incomparable in expressiveness to FLTL, so undecidability for MTL is not implied by the result for FLTL. We show, however, that the model-checking problem for MTL is undecidable. We further prove that the satisfiability problem for the unary fragments of TPTL and MTL are undecidable; for TPTL, this even holds for the fragment in which only one register and the finally modality is used. This is opposed to a known decidability result for the satisfiability problem for the same fragment of FLTL.},

Further, we conceive a method of QBF solving in which dependency recomputation is utilised as a form of inprocessing. Formalising this notion, we introduce a new version of Q-resolution in which a dependency scheme is applied dynamically. We demonstrate the further potential of this approach beyond that of the existing static system with an exponential separation. Last, we show that the same picture emerges in an analogous approach to the universal expansion paradigm.},

A natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this article, we present a transfer result applying to this construction: We show that for suitable logically defined classes, separation for the logic enriched with the successor relation reduces to separation for the original logic. Our theorem also applies to a problem that is stronger than separation: covering. Moreover, we actually present two reductions: one for languages of finite words and the other for languages of infinite words.},

The resulting video illustrates the given narrative, provides diverse visual content, and follows cinematographic guidelines. The process involves three simple steps: (1) the user provides input, mostly in the form of editing the text, (2) the tool automatically searches for semantically matching candidate shots from the video repository, and (3) an optimization method assembles the video montage. Visual-semantic matching between segmented text and shots is performed by cascaded keyword matching and visual-semantic embedding, that have better accuracy than alternative solutions. The video assembly is formulated as a hybrid optimization problem over a graph of shots, considering temporal constraints, cinematography metrics such as camera movement and tone, and user-specified cinematography idioms. Using our system, users without video editing experience are able to generate appealing videos.},

Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.},

In this paper, we study the consistency of team fracture: a loss of team viability so severe that the team no longer wants to work together. Understanding whether team fracture is driven by the membership of the team, or by how their collaboration unfolded, motivates the design of interventions that either identify compatible teammates or ensure effective early interactions. We introduce an online experiment that reconvenes the same team without members realizing that they have worked together before, enabling us to temporarily erase previous team dynamics. Participants in our study completed a series of tasks across multiple teams, including one reconvened team, and privately blacklisted any teams that they would not want to work with again. We identify fractured teams as those blacklisted by half the members. We find that reconvened teams are strikingly polarized by task in the consistency of their fracture outcomes. On a creative task, teams might as well have been a completely different set of people: the same teams changed their fracture outcomes at a random chance rate. On a cognitive conflict and on an intellective task, the team instead replayed the same dynamics without realizing it, rarely changing their fracture outcomes. These results indicate that, for some tasks, team fracture can be strongly influenced by interactions in the first moments of a team's collaboration, and that interventions targeting these initial moments may be critical to scaffolding long-lasting teams.},

Next, we develop an algorithm that takes an arbitrary idempotent anti-unification problem and computes a representation of its solution set in the form of a regular tree grammar. The algorithm does not depend on the number of idempotent function symbols in the input terms. The language generated by the grammar is the minimal complete set of generalizations of the given anti-unification problem, which implies that idempotent anti-unification is infinitary.},

However, existing prefetchers can only target premeditated patterns and relations they were designed to handle and are unable to capture access patterns in which they do not specialize. In this article, we propose a context-based neural network (NN) prefetcher that dynamically adapts to arbitrary memory access patterns. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning, the proposed NN prefetcher correlates program and machine contextual information with memory accesses patterns, using online-training to identify and dynamically adapt to unique access patterns exhibited by the code. By targeting
            semantic locality
            in this manner, the prefetcher can discern the useful context attributes and learn to predict previously undetected access patterns, even within noisy memory access streams. We further present an architectural implementation of our NN prefetcher, explore its power, energy, and area limitations, and propose several optimizations.

  abstract = {In recent years, a new approach has been developed for verifying security protocols with the aim of combining the benefits of symbolic attackers and the benefits of unconditional soundness: the technique of the computationally complete symbolic attacker of Bana and Comon (BC) [8]. In this article, we argue that the real breakthrough of this technique is the recent introduction of its version for indistinguishability [9], because, with the extensions we introduce here, for the first time, there is a computationally sound symbolic technique that is syntactically strikingly simple, to which translating standard computational security notions is a straightforward matter, and that can be effectively used for verification of not only equivalence properties but trace properties of protocols as well. We first fully develop the core elements of this newer version by introducing several new axioms. We illustrate the power and the diverse use of the introduced axioms on simple examples first. We introduce an axiom expressing the Decisional Diffie-Hellman property. We analyze the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, both in its simplest form and an authenticated version as well. We provide computationally sound verification of real-or-random secrecy of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for multiple sessions, without any restrictions on the computational implementation other than the DDH assumption. We also show authentication for a simplified version of the station-to-station protocol using UF-CMA assumption for digital signatures. Finally, we axiomatize IND-CPA, IND-CCA1, and IND-CCA2 security properties and illustrate their usage. We have formalized the axiomatic system in an interactive theorem prover, Coq, and have machine-checked the proofs of various auxiliary theorems and security properties of Diffie-Hellman and station-to-station protocol.},

Our approach targets distributed systems whose components communicate with monitors over unreliable channels, where messages can be delayed, reordered, or even lost. Furthermore, our approach handles an expressive specification language that extends the real-time logic MTL with freeze quantifiers for reasoning about data values. The logic’s main novelty is a new three-valued semantics that is well suited for runtime verification as it accounts for partial knowledge about a system’s behavior. Based on this semantics, we present online algorithms that reason soundly and completely about streams where events can occur out of order. We also evaluate our algorithms experimentally. Depending on the specification, our prototype implementation scales to out-of-order streams with hundreds to thousands of events per second.},

Prior work has dealt with special cases of the problem but has left the precise complexity characterization open. In addition, the complexity of one important special case, that of containment under access patterns, was not known before. We start by revisiting the connection between MDL/UCQ containment and containment problems involving regular tree languages. We then present a general approach for getting tighter bounds on the complexity of query containment, based on analysis of the number of mappings of queries into tree-like instances. We give two applications of the machinery. We first give an important special case of the MDL/UCQ containment problem that is in EXPTIME, and we use this bound to show an EXPTIME bound on containment under access patterns. Second, we show that the same technique can be used to get a new tight upper bound for containment of tree automata in UCQs. We finally show that the new MDL/UCQ upper bounds are tight. We establish a 2EXPTIME lower bound on the MDL/UCQ containment problem, resolving an open problem from the early 1990s. This bound holds for the MDL/CQ containment problem as well. We also show that changes to the conditions given in our special cases can not be eliminated, and that in particular slight variations of the problem of containment under access patterns become 2EXPTIME-complete.},

  abstract = {It follows from known results in the literature that least and greatest fixed-points of monotone polynomials on Heyting algebras—that is, the algebraic models of the Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus—always exist, even when these algebras are not complete as lattices. The reason is that these extremal fixed-points are definable by formulas of the
            IPC
            . Consequently, the μ-calculus based on intuitionistic logic is trivial, every μ-formula being equivalent to a fixed-point free formula. In the first part of this article, we give an axiomatization of least and greatest fixed-points of formulas, and an algorithm to compute a fixed-point free formula equivalent to a given μ-formula. The axiomatization of the greatest fixed-point is simple. The axiomatization of the least fixed-point is more complex, in particular every monotone formula converges to its least fixed-point by Kleene’s iteration in a finite number of steps, but there is no uniform upper bound on the number of iterations. The axiomatization yields a decision procedure for the μ-calculus based on propositional intuitionistic logic. The second part of the article deals with closure ordinals of monotone polynomials on Heyting algebras and of intuitionistic monotone formulas; these are the least numbers of iterations needed for a polynomial/formula to converge to its least fixed-point. Mirroring the elimination procedure, we show how to compute upper bounds for closure ordinals of arbitrary intuitionistic formulas. For some classes of formulas, we provide tighter upper bounds that, in some cases, we prove exact.},

To set up the formal framework, we start with developing a basic reason-maintenance belief logic, present its syntax and semantics, and investigate its axiomatization and properties. Then, we extend the basic logic to accommodate the possibilistic uncertainty of information and beliefs, provide a complete axiomatization of the extended logic, and show that it can address the reason-maintenance issue of partially inconsistent beliefs. We also demonstrate the applicability of our formalisms by using several examples in realistic scenarios.},

Specifically, we show that if there is an attack then there is one that is well-typed.

In particular, we prove that it selects allocations that are envy-free up to one good—a compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and—even more so—in practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation and demonstrate that it scales well on real data. These results establish MNW as a compelling solution for allocating indivisible goods and underlie its deployment on a popular fair-division website.},

Following previous work, we propose to solve SMT(QF-NIA) instances by reducing them to linear arithmetic: non-linear monomials are linearized by abstracting them with fresh variables and by performing case splitting on integer variables with finite domain. For variables that do not have a finite domain, we can artificially introduce one by imposing a lower and an upper bound and iteratively enlarge it until a solution is found (or the procedure times out).
          The key for the success of the approach is to determine, at each iteration, which domains have to be enlarged. Previously, unsatisfiable cores were used to identify the domains to be changed, but no clue was obtained as to how large the new domains should be. Here, we explain two novel ways to guide this process by analyzing solutions to optimization problems: (i) to minimize the number of violated artificial domain bounds, solved via a Max-SMT solver, and (ii) to minimize the distance with respect to the artificial domains, solved via an Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) solver. Using this SMT-based optimization technology allows smoothly extending the method to also solve Max-SMT problems over non-linear integer arithmetic. Finally, we leverage the resulting Max-SMT(QF-NIA) techniques to solve ∃ ∀ formulas in a fragment of quantified non-linear arithmetic that appears commonly in verification and synthesis applications.},

In particular, many social, industrial, and business information systems require a common basis for a seamless exchange of complex process information. This is, however, inhibited, because different systems may use distinct terminologies or assume different meanings for the same terms. A common solution to this problem is to develop logical theories that act as an intermediate language between different parties. In this article, we characterize a class of activities that can act as intermediate languages between different parties in those cases. We show that for each domain with finite number of elements there exists a class of activities, we called canonical activities, such that all possible changes within the domain can be represented as a sequence of occurrences of those activities. We use an algebraic structure for representing change and characterizing canonical activities, which enables us to abstract away domain-dependent properties of processes and activities, and demonstrate general properties of formalisms required for semantic integration of dynamic information systems.},

These nominal quantifiers called “new” and “wen” are distinct from the self-dual Gabbay-Pitts and Miller-Tiu nominal quantifiers. The novelty of these nominal quantifiers is they are polarised in the sense that “new” distributes over positive operators while “wen” distributes over negative operators. This greater control of bookkeeping enables private names to be modelled in processes embedded as formulae in MAV1. The technical challenge is to establish a cut elimination result from which essential properties including the transitivity of implication follow. Since the system is defined using the calculus of structures, a generalisation of the sequent calculus, novel techniques are employed. The proof relies on an intricately designed multiset-based measure of the size of a proof, which is used to guide a normalisation technique called
            splitting
            . The presence of equivariance, which swaps successive quantifiers, induces complex inter-dependencies between nominal quantifiers, additive conjunction, and multiplicative operators in the proof of splitting. Every rule is justified by an example demonstrating why the rule is necessary for soundly embedding processes and ensuring that cut elimination holds.},

We propose a probabilistic rational temporal logic PRTL*, which extends the probabilistic computation tree logic PCTL* with reasoning about mental attitudes (beliefs, goals, and intentions) and includes novel operators that can express concepts of social trust such as competence, disposition, and dependence.

              N
            
            . By a result of Thiagarajan [46], these unfoldings are exactly the trace-regular event structures. Thiagarajan [46] conjectured that regular event structures correspond exactly to trace-regular event structures. In a recent paper (Chalopin and Chepoi [12]), we disproved this conjecture, based on the striking bijection between domains of event structures, median graphs, and CAT(0) cube complexes. However, we proved that Thiagarajan’s conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains are principal filters of universal covers of finite special cube complexes.
          
          
            In the current article, we prove the converse: To any finite 1-safe Petri net
            N
            , one can associate a finite special cube complex X

            . This establishes a bijection between 1-safe Petri nets and finite special cube complexes and provides a combinatorial characterization of trace-regular event structures.
          
          
            Using this bijection and techniques from graph theory and geometry (MSO theory of graphs, bounded treewidth, and bounded hyperbolicity), we disprove yet another conjecture by Thiagarajan (from the paper with Yang [48]) that the monadic second-order logic of a 1-safe Petri net (i.e., of its event structure unfolding) is decidable if and only if its unfolding is grid-free. It was proven by Thiagarajan and Yang [48] that the MSO logic is undecidable if the unfolding is not grid-free. Our counterexample is the trace-regular event structure that arises from a virtually special square complex Z. The domain of this event structure
            Ė
            
              Z
            
            is the principal filter of the universal cover Z̃ of Z in which to each vertex we added a pendant edge. The graph of the domain of

              Z
            
            has bounded hyperbolicity (and, thus, the event structure

              Z
            
            is grid-free) but has infinite treewidth. Using results of Seese, Courcelle, and Müller and Schupp, we show that this implies that the MSO theory of the event structure

              Z

  abstract = {We consider probabilistic model checking for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) induced from Stochastic Reaction Networks against a fragment of Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) extended with reward operators. Classical numerical algorithms for CSL model checking based on uniformisation are limited to finite CTMCs and suffer from exponential growth of the state space with respect to the number of species. However, approximate techniques such as mean-field approximations and simulations combined with statistical inference are more scalable but can be time-consuming and do not support the full expressiveness of CSL. In this article, we employ a continuous-space approximation of the CTMC in terms of a Gaussian process based on the Central Limit Approximation, also known as the Linear Noise Approximation, whose solution requires solving a number of differential equations that is quadratic in the number of species and independent of the population size. We then develop efficient and scalable approximate model checking algorithms on the resulting Gaussian process, where we restrict the target regions for probabilistic reachability to convex polytopes. This allows us to derive an abstraction in terms of a time-inhomogeneous discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), whose dimension is independent of the number of species, on which model checking is performed. Using results from probability theory, we prove the convergence in distribution of our algorithms to the corresponding measures on the original CTMC. We implement the techniques and, on a set of examples, demonstrate that they allow us to overcome the state space explosion problem, while still correctly characterizing the stochastic behaviour of the system. Our methods can be used for formal analysis of a wide range of distributed stochastic systems, including biochemical systems, sensor networks, and population protocols.},

  abstract = {Some artists peel citrus fruits into a variety of elegant 2D shapes, depicting animals, plants, and cartoons. It is a creative art form, called
            Citrus Peeling Art.
            This art form follows the conservation principle, i.e., each shape must be created using one entire peel. Central to this art is finding optimal cut lines so that the citruses can be cut and unfolded into the desired shapes. However, it is extremely difficult for users to imagine and generate cuts for their desired shapes. To this end, we present a computational method for citrus peeling art designs. Our key insight is that instead of solving the difficult cut generation problem, we map a designed input shape onto a citrus in an attempt to cover the entire citrus and use the mapped boundary to generate the cut paths. Sometimes, a mapped shape is unable to completely cover a citrus. Consequently, we have developed five customized ways of interaction that are used to rectify the input shape so that it is suitable for citrus peeling art. The mapping process and user interactions are iteratively conducted to satisfy a user's design intentions. A large number of experiments, including a formative user study, demonstrate the capability and practicability of our method for peeling art design and construction.},

  abstract = {We present an inverse design tool for fabric formwork - a process where flat panels are sewn together to form a fabric container for casting a plaster sculpture. Compared to 3D printing techniques, the benefit of fabric formwork is its properties of low-cost and easy transport. The process of fabric formwork is akin to molding and casting but having a soft boundary. Deformation of the fabric container is governed by force equilibrium between the pressure forces from liquid fill and tension in the stretched fabric. The final result of fabrication depends on the shapes of the flat panels, the fabrication orientation and the placement of external supports. Our computational framework generates optimized flat panels and fabrication orientation with reference to a target shape, and determines effective locations for external supports. We demonstrate the function of this design tool on a variety of models with different shapes and topology. Physical fabrication is also demonstrated to validate our approach.},

  abstract = {Hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) combine advantages of multicopters and fixed-wing planes: vertical take-off, landing, and low energy use. However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs (Figure 1, 8). The experiments show that the controller is robust to exploit the complex dynamics when both rotors and wings are active in flight tests.},

The results of this article have a significant impact on several fields, including scalable distributed systems, resilient and self-

            systems, and verification of parameterized systems. First, we identify necessary and sufficient local conditions for the existence of global livelocks in parameterized unidirectional rings with unbounded (but finite) number of processes under the interleaving semantics. Using a reduction from the periodic domino problem, we show that, in general, verifying livelock-freedom of parameterized unidirectional rings is undecidable (specifically, Π
            1
            0
            -complete) even for constant space, deterministic, and self-disabling processes. This result implies that verifying self-stabilization for parameterized rings of self-disabling processes is also undecidable. We also show that verifying livelock-freedom and self-stabilization remain undecidable under (1) synchronous execution semantics, (2) the FIFO consistency model, and (3) any scheduling policy. We then present a new scope-based method for detecting and constructing livelocks in parameterized rings. The proposed semi-algorithm behind our scope-based verification is based on a novel paradigm for the detection of livelocks that totally circumvents state space exploration. Our experimental results on an implementation of the proposed semi-algorithm are very promising as we have found livelocks in parameterized rings in a few microseconds on a regular laptop. The results of this article have significant implications for scalable distributed systems with cyclic topologies.},

  abstract = {Branch decomposition is a prominent method for structurally decomposing a graph, a hypergraph, or a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form. The width of a branch decomposition provides a measure of how well the object is decomposed. For many applications, it is crucial to computing a branch decomposition whose width is as small as possible. We propose an approach based on Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) to finding branch decompositions of small width. The core of our approach is an efficient SAT encoding that determines with a single SAT-call whether a given hypergraph admits a branch decomposition of a certain width. For our encoding, we propose a natural partition-based characterization of branch decompositions. The encoding size imposes a limit on the size of the given hypergraph. To break through this barrier and to scale the SAT approach to larger instances, we develop a new heuristic approach where the SAT encoding is used to locally improve a given candidate decomposition until a fixed-point is reached. This new SAT-based local improvement method scales now to instances with several thousands of vertices and edges.},

To utilize this fact, two substantial gaps have to be addressed: (i) What makes a sequent calculus analytic? and (ii) How do we obtain an efficient decision procedure for derivability in an analytic calculus? In the first part of this article, we answer these questions for
            pure calculi
            —a general family of fully structural propositional sequent calculi whose rules allow arbitrary context formulas. We provide a sufficient syntactic criterion for analyticity in these calculi, as well as a productive method to construct new analytic calculi from given ones. We further introduce a scalable decision procedure for derivability in analytic pure calculi by showing that it can be (uniformly) reduced to classical satisfiability. In the second part of the article, we study the extension of pure sequent calculi with modal operators. We show that such extensions preserve the analyticity of the calculus and identify certain restricted operators (which we call “Next” operators) that are also amenable for a general reduction of derivability to classical satisfiability. Our proofs are all semantic, utilizing several strong general soundness and completeness theorems with respect to non-deterministic semantic frameworks: bivaluations (for pure calculi) and Kripke models (for their extension with modal operators).},

  abstract = {We examine sequential equilibrium in the context ofcomputational games(Halpern and Pass 2015), where agents are charged for computation. In such games, an agent can rationally choose to forget, so issues of imperfect recall arise. In this setting, we consider two notions of sequential equilibrium. One is anex antenotion, where a player chooses his strategy before the game starts and is committed to it, but chooses it in such a way that it remains optimal even off the equilibrium path. The second is aninterimnotion, where a player can reconsider at each information set whether he is doing the “right” thing, and if not, can change his strategy. The two notions agree in games of perfect recall, but not in games of imperfect recall. Although the interim notion seems more appealing, in a companion article (Halpern and Pass 2016), we argue that there are some deep conceptual problems with it in standard games of imperfect recall. We show that the conceptual problems largely disappear in the computational setting. Moreover, in this setting, under natural assumptions, the two notions coincide.},

We give an effective logical characterisation of the reachability relation of timed-register pushdown automata. As a corollary, we obtain a doubly exponential time procedure for the non-emptiness problem. We show that the complexity reduces to singly exponential under the assumption of monotonic time. The proofs involve a novel model of one-dimensional integer branching vector addition systems with states. As a result interesting on its own, we show that reachability sets of the latter model are semilinear and computable in exponential time.},

Specifically we focus on the primary use of conductive stretchable fabrics to sense the skin deformation during joint motion and infer the joint rotational angle. We tackle challenges of fabric sensing originated by the inherent properties of elastic materials by leveraging two types of sensing fabric and characterizing their properties based on models in material science. We apply models from bio-mechanics to infer joint angles and propose the use of dual strain sensing to enhance sensing robustness against user diversity and fabric position offsets. We fabricate prototypes using off-the-shelf fabrics and micro-controller. Experiments with ten participants show 9.69° median angular error in tracking joint angle and its sensing robustness across various users and activities.},

The rise of infographics and the visual information overload that we are facing today have given this task a crucial importance. Automatic systems are increasingly needed to help users navigate through the growing amount of visual information available, either on the web or our personal devices, for instance by selecting relevant and interesting content. Previous studies indicate that visual interest is highly related to concepts like arousal, unusualness, or complexity, where these connections are found based on psychological theories, user studies, or computational approaches. However, the link between visual interestingness and other related concepts has been only partially explored so far, for example, by considering only a limited subset of covariates at a time.

            , a powerful knowledge representation language widely used in ontology-based query answering. In this setting, a conjunctive query is evaluated over a Datalog
            ∃
            program consisting of extensional data paired with so-called “existential” rules. Owing to their high expressiveness, such rules make the evaluation of queries undecidable, even when the latter are atomic. Decidable generalizations of Datalog by existential rules have been proposed in the literature (such as weakly acyclic and weakly guarded); but they pay the price of higher computational complexity, hindering the implementation of effective systems. Conversely, the results in this article demonstrate that it is definitely possible to enable fast yet powerful query answering over existential rules that strictly generalize Datalog by ensuring decidability without any complexity overhead. On the theoretical side, we define the class of parsimonious programs that guarantees decidability of atomic queries. We then strengthen this class to strongly parsimonious programs ensuring decidability also for conjunctive queries. Since parsimony is an undecidable property, we single out Shy, an easily recognizable class of strongly parsimonious programs that generalizes Datalog while preserving its complexity even under conjunctive queries. Shy also generalizes the class of linear existential programs, while it is uncomparable to the other main classes ensuring decidability. On the practical side, we exploit our results to implement DLV
            ∃
            , an effective system for query answering over parsimonious existential rules. To assess its efficiency, we carry out an experimental analysis, evaluating DLV

  abstract = {Given the increasing popularity of customer service dialogue on Twitter, analysis of conversation data is essential to understanding trends in customer and agent behavior for the purpose of automating customer service interactions. In this work, we develop a novel taxonomy of fine-grained “dialogue acts” frequently observed in customer service, showcasing acts that are more suited to the domain than the more generic existing taxonomies. Using a sequential SVM-HMM model, we model conversation flow, predicting the dialogue act of a given turn in real time, and showcase this using our “PredDial” portal. We characterize differences between customer and agent behavior in Twitter customer service conversations and investigate the effect of testing our system on different customer service industries. Finally, we use a data-driven approach to predict important conversation outcomes: customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and overall problem resolution. We show that the type and location of certain dialogue acts in a conversation have a significant effect on the probability of desirable and undesirable outcomes and present actionable rules based on our findings. We explore the correlations between different dialogue acts and the outcome of the conversations in detail using an actionable-rule discovery task by leveraging a state-of-the-art sequential rule mining algorithm while modeling a set of conversations as a set of sequences. The patterns and rules we derive can be used as guidelines for outcome-driven automated customer service platforms.},

  abstract = {In alternating-time temporal logic ATL*, agents with perfect recall assign choices to sequences of states, i.e., to possible finite histories of the game. However, when a nested strategic modality is interpreted, the new strategy does not take into account the previous sequence of events. It is as if agents collect their observations in the nested game again from scratch, thus, effectively forgetting what they observed before. Intuitively, it does not fit the assumption of agents having perfect recall of the past. In this article, we investigate the alternative semantics for ATL*where the past is not forgotten in nested games. We show that the standard semantics of ATL*coincides with the “truly perfect recall” semantics for agents with perfect information and in case of so-called “objective” abilities under uncertainty. On the other hand, the two semantics differ significantly for the most popular (“subjective”) notion of ability under imperfect information. The same applies to the standard vs. “truly perfect recall” semantics of ATL*with persistent strategies. We compare the relevant variants of ATL*by looking at their expressive power, sets of validities, and tractability of model checking.},

The resulting systems are modular and have separate left and right introduction rules for the modalities, which makes them amenable to specification as bipole clauses. While this granulation of the sequent rules introduces more choices for proof search, we show how linear nested sequent calculi can be restricted to blocked derivations, which directly correspond to ordinary sequent derivations.},

The communication is developed as a result of neural responses generated in the brain because of motor movements or cognitive activities. The means of communication here includes muscular and non-muscular actions. These actions generate brain activities or brain waves that are directed to a hardware device to perform a specific task. BCI initially was developed as the communication device for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Owing to recent advancements in BCI devices—such as passive electrodes, wireless headsets, adaptive software, and decreased costs—it is also being used for developing communication between the general public. The BCI device records brain responses using various invasive and non-invasive acquisition techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article, a survey on these techniques has been provided. The brain response needs to be translated using machine learning and pattern recognition methods to control any application. A brief review of various existing feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms applied on data recorded from the brain has been included in this article. A significant comparative analysis of popular existing BCI techniques is presented and possible future directives are provided.},

In this paper I will comment on the thoughtful rejoinders from Burton-Jones, Gregor, and Myers. I will also outline why, in spite of their wellfounded criticism, I still believe that Feyerabendian thinking is most appropriate for IS research-much more so than Popperian or Kuhnian. I will illustrate my reasoning by referring to several experiences with the academic double-blind peer review process. I will not only criticize academia's existing deficiencies, but also suggest a potential cure. My universal remedy is based on Feyerabend's philosophy of relativism, tolerance, and pluralism, which he not so cleverly disguised as anarchism. Recently, Chua et al. (2018) suggested changes in the rules of our academic review system. I do not aim at the system, but rather at the underlying mindset. If we allow him, Feyerabend can help us with that.},

We explore experimentally, numerically, and theoretically the typical and worst-case ROBDD sizes in terms of number of nodes and residual compression ratios, as compared to unreduced BDDs. While our theoretical results are not surprising, as they are in keeping with previously known results, we believe our method contributes to the current body of research by our experimental and statistical treatment of ROBDD sizes. In addition, we provide an algorithm to calculate the worst-case size. Finally, we present an algorithm for constructing a worst-case ROBDD of a given number of variables.

BRD also emphasizes using simplified fabrication tools, media and coding platforms, and microcontrollers common in youth content creation communities and makerspaces. This study provides a framework to analyze computational concepts, practices, and perspectives that leverage an integrated systems and multimodal learning approach, such as BRD, adding to, building on, and integrating previous analytic approaches to looking at Scratch coding, media design, physical computing and e-textiles. Using a detailed case study of one team during one of the early workshop iterations, we conduct a multimodal analysis of bidirectionally responsive making activities and discuss the ways that they present novel understanding of integrating diverse interests and encouraging collaborative and distributed computational thinking. We further examine how BRD operationalizes and extends multimodal learning theory by adding tangible and integrative dimensions as additional modalities learners can leverage to facilitate meaning making, metacognition, and agency. We also discuss how designing integrated systems, as facilitated through BRD, provides an opportunity to engage in authentic practices around the design of complex systems.},

Computational fields have been proposed as an effective abstraction to fill the gap between the macro-level of such systems (specifying a system’s collective behaviour) and the micro-level (individual devices’ actions of computation and interaction to implement that collective specification), thereby providing a basis to better facilitate the engineering of collective APIs and complex systems at higher levels of abstraction. This article proposes a full formal foundation for field computations, in terms of a core (higher-order) calculus of computational fields containing a few key syntactic constructs, and equipped with typing, denotational and operational semantics. Critically, this allows formal establishment of a link between the micro- and macro-levels of collective adaptive systems by a result of computational adequacy and abstraction for the (aggregate) denotational semantics with respect to the (per-device) operational semantics.},

In this article, we aim to automate the process of selecting an appropriate DNN topology that fulfills both functional and non-functional requirements of the application. Specifically, we focus on tuning two important hyperparameters, depth and width, which together define the shape of the resulting network and directly affect its accuracy, speed, size, and energy consumption. To reduce the time needed to search the design space, we train a fraction of DNNs and build a model to predict the performances of the remaining ones. We are able to produce tuned ResNets, which are up to 4.22 times faster than original depth-scaled ResNets on a batch of 128 images while matching their accuracy.},

  abstract = {In recent years, model checking with interval temporal logics is emerging as a viable alternative to model checking with standard point-based temporal logics, such as LTL, CTL, CTL*, and the like. The behavior of the system is modeled by means of (finite) Kripke structures, as usual. However, while temporal logics which are interpreted “point-wise” describe how the system evolves state-by-state, and predicate properties of system states, those which are interpreted “interval-wise” express properties of computation stretches, spanning a sequence of states. A proposition letter is assumed to hold over a computation stretch (interval) if and only if it holds over each component state (homogeneity assumption). A natural question arises: is there any advantage in replacing points by intervals as the primary temporal entities, or is it just a matter of taste?
          In this article, we study the expressiveness of Halpern and Shoham’s interval temporal logic (HS) in model checking, in comparison with those of LTL, CTL, and CTL*. To this end, we consider three semantic variants of HS: the state-based one, introduced by Montanari et al. in [30, 34], that allows time to branch both in the past and in the future, the computation-tree-based one, that allows time to branch in the future only, and the trace-based variant, that disallows time to branch. These variants are compared among themselves and to the aforementioned standard logics, getting a complete picture. In particular, we show that HS with trace-based semantics is equivalent to LTL (but at least exponentially more succinct), HS with computation-tree-based semantics is equivalent to finitary CTL*, and HS with state-based semantics is incomparable with all of them (LTL, CTL, and CTL*).},

  abstract = {We analyze how the standard reductions between constraint satisfaction problems affect their proof complexity. We show that, for the most studied propositional, algebraic, and semialgebraic proof systems, the classical constructions of pp-interpretability, homomorphic equivalence, and addition of constants to a core preserve the proof complexity of the CSP. As a result, for those proof systems, the classes of constraint languages for which small unsatisfiability certificates exist can be characterized algebraically. We illustrate our results by a gap theorem saying that a constraint language either has resolution refutations of constant width or does not have bounded-depth Frege refutations of subexponential size. The former holds exactly for the widely studied class of constraint languages of bounded width. This class is also known to coincide with the class of languages with refutations of sublinear degree in Sums of Squares and Polynomial Calculus over the real field, for which we provide alternative proofs. We then ask for the existence of a natural proof system with good behavior with respect to reductions and simultaneously small-size refutations beyond bounded width. We give an example of such a proof system by showing that bounded-degree Lovász-Schrijver satisfies both requirements. Finally, building on the known lower bounds, we demonstrate the applicability of the method of reducibilities and construct new explicit hard instances of the graph three-coloring problem for all studied proof systems.},

First, the hardware must support viewing sharp imagery over the full accommodation range of the user. Second, HMDs should accurately reproduce retinal defocus blur to correctly drive accommodation. A multitude of
            accommodation-supporting
            HMDs have been proposed, with three architectures receiving particular attention: varifocal, multifocal, and light field displays. These designs all extend depth of focus, but rely on computationally expensive rendering and optimization algorithms to reproduce accurate defocus blur (often limiting content complexity and interactive applications). To date, no unified framework has been proposed to support driving these emerging HMDs using commodity content. In this paper, we introduce

This network is demonstrated to accurately synthesize defocus blur, focal stacks, multilayer decompositions, and multiview imagery using only commonly available RGB-D images, enabling real-time, near-correct depictions of retinal blur with a broad set of accommodation-supporting HMDs.},

Through a lab study and multi-week deployment we find cell folding aids notebook navigation and comprehension, not only by the original author, but also by collaborators viewing the notebook in a meeting or revising it on their own. However, in some cases cell folding encouraged collaborators to overlook folded sections or spend longer reviewing a notebook before editing it. These findings extend our understanding of code folding's trade-offs to a new medium and demonstrate its benefits for everyday collaboration. We conclude by discussing how dynamic reorganization can support sharing and reuse of computational notebooks.},

Prior work has developed systems for improving collective ideation and design by exposing people to each others' ideas and encouraging them to intermix those ideas. However, organizational behavior research has demonstrated that intermixing ideas does not result in meaningful engagement with those ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility.},

We leverage the dynamics of Hopfield networks and spin-glass systems to construct a fully connected spiking neural system to generate synchronous spike responses indicative of the underlying community structure in an undirected, unweighted graph. Mapping this fully connected system to current generation neuromorphic hardware is done by embedding sparse tree graphs to generate only the leading-order spiking dynamics. We demonstrate that for a chosen set of benchmark graphs, the spike responses generated on a current generation neuromorphic processor can improve the stability of graph partitions and non-overlapping communities can be identified even with the loss of higher-order spiking behavior if the graphs are sufficiently dense. For sparse graphs, the loss of higher-order spiking behavior improves the stability of certain graph partitions but does not retrieve the known community memberships.},

  abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a Geometry of Interaction (GoI) interpretation inspired from Hughes--Van Glabbeek (HvG) proof-nets for multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL). Our GoI dynamically captures HvG’s geometric correctness criterion—the toggling cycle condition—in terms of algebraic operators. Our new ingredient is a scalar extension of the *-algebra in Girard’s *-ring of partial isometries over a Boolean polynomial ring with literals of eigenweights as indeterminates. To capture feedback arising from cuts, we construct a finer-grained execution formula. The expansion of this execution formula is longer than that for collections of slices for multiplicative GoI, hence it is harder to prove termination. Our GoI gives a dynamical, semantical account of Boolean valuations (in particular, pruning sub-proofs), conversion of weights (in particular, α-conversion), and additive (co)contraction, peculiar to additive proof-theory. Termination of our execution formula is shown to correspond to HvG’s toggling criterion. The slice-wise restriction of our execution formula (by collapsing the Boolean structure) yields the well-known correspondence, explicit or implicit in previous works on multiplicative GoI, between the convergence of execution formulas and acyclicity of proof-nets. Feedback arising from the execution formula by restricting to the Boolean polynomial structure yields autonomous definability of eigenweights among cuts from the rest of the eigenweights.},

            , parallel cost captures the cost of synchronized tasks executing in parallel by exploiting the true concurrency available in the execution model of distributed processing. True concurrency is challenging for static cost analysis, because the parallelism between tasks needs to be soundly inferred, and the waiting and idle processor times at the different locations need to be accounted for. Parallel cost analysis works in three phases: (1) it performs a
            block-level
            analysis to estimate the serial costs of the blocks between synchronization points in the program; (2) it then constructs a
            distributed flow graph
            (DFG) to capture the parallelism, the waiting, and idle times at the locations of the distributed system; and (3) the parallel cost can finally be obtained as the
            path of maximal cost
            in the DFG. We prove the correctness of the proposed parallel cost analysis, and provide a prototype implementation to perform an experimental evaluation of the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed analysis.},

  abstract = {This article presents an extension of temporal epistemic logic with operators that can express quantification over agent strategies. Unlike previous work on alternating temporal epistemic logic, the semantics works with systems whose states explicitly encode the strategy being used by each of the agents. This provides a natural way to express what agents would know were they to be aware of some of the strategies being used by other agents. A number of examples that rely on the ability to express an agent’s knowledge about the strategies being used by other agents are presented to motivate the framework, including reasoning about game-theoretic equilibria, knowledge-based programs, and information-theoretic computer security policies. Relationships to several variants of alternating temporal epistemic logic are discussed. The computational complexity of model checking the logic and several of its fragments are also characterized.},

  abstract = {Evaluation in empirical computer science is essential to show progress and assess technologies developed. Several research domains such as information retrieval have long relied on systematic evaluation to measure progress: here, the Cranfield paradigm of creating shared test collections, defining search tasks, and collecting ground truth for these tasks has persisted up until now. In recent years, however, several new challenges have emerged that do not fit this paradigm very well: extremely large data sets, confidential data sets as found in the medical domain, and rapidly changing data sets as often encountered in industry. Crowdsourcing has also changed the way in which industry approaches problem-solving with companies now organizing challenges and handing out monetary awards to incentivize people to work on their challenges, particularly in the field of machine learning.
          This article is based on discussions at a workshop on Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS). EaaS is the paradigm of not providing data sets to participants and have them work on the data locally, but keeping the data central and allowing access via Application Programming Interfaces (API), Virtual Machines (VM), or other possibilities to ship executables. The objectives of this article are to summarize and compare the current approaches and consolidate the experiences of these approaches to outline the next steps of EaaS, particularly toward sustainable research infrastructures.
          The article summarizes several existing approaches to EaaS and analyzes their usage scenarios and also the advantages and disadvantages. The many factors influencing EaaS are summarized, and the environment in terms of motivations for the various stakeholders, from funding agencies to challenge organizers, researchers and participants, to industry interested in supplying real-world problems for which they require solutions.
          EaaS solves many problems of the current research environment, where data sets are often not accessible to many researchers. Executables of published tools are equally often not available making the reproducibility of results impossible. EaaS, however, creates reusable/citable data sets as well as available executables. Many challenges remain, but such a framework for research can also foster more collaboration between researchers, potentially increasing the speed of obtaining research results.},

We present the vocabulary of the FEP language, introduce its usage in analyzing styles from annotated film data, and describe how it can support users in the creative design of film sequences in 3D. More specifically, (i) we define the FEP language, (ii) we present an application to craft filmic sequences from 3D animated scenes that uses FEPs as a high level mean to select cameras and perform cuts between cameras that follow best practices in cinema, and (iii) we evaluate the benefits of FEPs by performing user experiments in which professional filmmakers and amateurs had to create cinematographic sequences. The evaluation suggests that users generally appreciate the idea of FEPs, and that it can effectively help novice and medium experienced users in crafting film sequences with little training.},

Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students’ knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review
            on the reviewers
            , and the results this has on the students’ learning.
          
          To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students’ conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students’ level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts.},

In GTS, truth is defined in terms of existence of a winning strategy in a semantic evaluation game. Thus, the game-theoretic perspective appears in the framework of ATL on two semantic levels: on the object level in the standard semantics of the strategic operators and on the meta-level, where game-theoretic logical semantics is applied to ATL. We unify these two perspectives into semantic evaluation games specially designed for ATL. The game-theoretic perspective enables us to identify new variants of the semantics of ATL based on limiting the time resources available to the verifier and falsifier in the semantic evaluation game. We introduce and analyze an
            unbounded
            and
            (ordinal) bounded
            GTS and prove these to be equivalent to the standard (Tarski-style) compositional semantics. We show that, in bounded GTS, truth of ATL formulae can always be determined in finite time, that is, without constructing infinite paths. We also introduce a nonequivalent
            finitely bounded
            semantics and argue that it is natural from both logical and game-theoretic perspectives.},

  abstract = {Computational psychology has the aim to explain human cognition by computational models of cognitive processes. The cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought--Rational (ACT-R) is popular to develop such models. Although ACT-R has a well-defined psychological theory and has been used to explain many cognitive processes, there are two problems that make it hard to reason formally about its cognitive models: First, ACT-R lacks a computational formalization of its underlying production rule system, and, second, there are many different implementations and extensions of ACT-R with many technical artifacts complicating formal reasoning even more.
          
            This article describes a formal operational semantics—the
            very abstract semantics
            —that abstracts from as many technical details as possible, keeping it open to extensions and different implementations of the ACT-R theory. In a second step, this semantics is refined to define some of its abstract features that are found in many implementations of ACT-R—called the
            abstract semantics
            . It concentrates on the procedural core of ACT-R and is suitable for analysis of the general transition system, since it still abstracts from details like timing, the sub-symbolic layer of ACT-R or conflict resolution.
          
          Furthermore, a translation of ACT-R models to the declarative programming language Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is defined. This makes the abstract semantics an executable specification of ACT-R. CHR has been used successfully to embed other rule-based formalisms like graph transformation systems or functional programming. There are many theoretical results and practical tools that support formal reasoning about and analysis of CHR programs. The translation of ACT-R models to CHR is proven sound and complete w.r.t. the abstract operational semantics of ACT-R. This paves the way to analysis of ACT-R models through CHR analysis results and tools. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, our abstract semantics is the first abstract formulation of ACT-R suitable for both analysis and execution.},

We show that adding binary relations over finite paths in the picture may alter the situation. We consider a general setting where finite paths of transition systems are linked by means of a fixed binary relation. This setting gives rise to natural extensions of MSO and the mu-calculus, that we call the MSOwith paths relationand thejumping mu-calculus, the expressivities of which we aim at comparing. We first show that “bounded-memory” binary relations bring about no additional expressivity to either of the two logics, and thus preserve expressive completeness. In contrast, we show that for a natural, classic “infinite-memory” binary relation stemming from games with imperfect information, the existence of a winning strategy in such games, though expressible in the bisimulation-invariant fragment of MSO with paths relation, cannot be expressed in the jumping mu-calculus. Expressive completeness thus fails for this relation. These results crucially rely on our observation that the jumping mu-calculus has a tree automata counterpart: thejumping tree automata, hence the name of the jumping mu-calculus. We also prove that forobservablewinning conditions, the existence of winning strategies in games with imperfect information is expressible in the jumping mu-calculus. Finally, we derive from our main theorem that jumping automata cannot be projected, and ATL with imperfect information does not admit expansion laws.},

The idea is to abstract nonlinear multiplication and transcendental functions as uninterpreted functions in an abstract space limited to linear arithmetic on the rationals with uninterpreted functions.

In the case of transcendental functions, particular care is required to ensure the soundness of the abstraction.

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing has recently seen drastic improvements in resolution, making it now possible to fabricate features at scales of hundreds or even dozens of nanometers, which previously required very expensive lithographic methods. As a result, additive manufacturing now seems poised for optical applications, including those relevant to computer graphics, such as material design, as well as display and imaging applications.
          In this work, we explore the use of additive manufacturing for generating structural colors, where the structures are designed using a fabrication-aware optimization process. This requires a combination of full-wave simulation, a feasible parameterization of the design space, and a tailored optimization procedure. Many of these components should be re-usable for the design of other optical structures at this scale.
          We show initial results of material samples fabricated based on our designs. While these suffer from the prototype character of state-of-the-art fabrication hardware, we believe they clearly demonstrate the potential of additive nanofabrication for structural colors and other graphics applications.},

  abstract = {Adaptive optics has become a valuable tool for correcting minor optical aberrations in applications such as astronomy and microscopy. However, due to the limited resolution of both the wavefront sensing and the wavefront correction hardware, it has so far not been feasible to use adaptive optics for correcting large-scale waveform deformations that occur naturally in regular photography and other imaging applications.
          In this work, we demonstrate an adaptive optics system for regular cameras. We achieve a significant improvement in focus for large wavefront distortions by improving upon a recently developed high resolution coded wavefront sensor, and combining it with a spatial phase modulator to create a megapixel adaptive optics system with unprecedented capability to sense and correct large distortions.},

He continues in a long and commendable tradition of the scientist as a subversive and rebel - a tradition including Galileo, Franklin, Darwin, and Einstein - and a tradition that emphasizes science as a creative human activity. Treiblmaier advances three propositions regarding Feyerabend's ideas and their potential for IS research. The first, if taken to mean that in Feyerabend's spirit of anarchy there should be ongoing questioning of our epistemological foundations, is worth supporting for a number of reasons, including the apparent hegemony of hypothetico-deductive type perspectives. The second, if meaning that in Feyerabend's spirit a variety of research approaches should be supported, is accepted in many traditional views of science. The third proposition is benign if "anything goes" as a principle means more openness and tolerance of differing and new viewpoints. However, there are issues if this stance includes strong relativism. Information systems research generates knowledge that can be applied to practical problems. We should be able to retain Feyerabend's questioning spirit, yet develop actionable knowledge that has sufficient credibility to be useful in the world.},

In these studies, many events must be monitored and processed quickly, including behavior of the subject (e.g., movement of a limb) or features of neural data (e.g., a neuron transmitting an action potential). Unfortunately, most realtime platforms are proprietary, require specific architectures, or are limited to low-level programming languages. Here we present a hardware-independent, open-source realtime computation platform that supports high-level programming. The resulting platform, LiCoRICE, can process on order 10e10 bits/sec of network data at 1 ms ticks with 18.2 µs jitter. It connects to various inputs and outputs (e.g., DIO, Ethernet, database logging, and analog line in/out) and minimizes reliance on custom device drivers by leveraging peripheral support via the Linux kernel. Its modular architecture supports model-based design for rapid prototyping with C and Python/Cython and can perform numerical operations via BLAS/LAPACK-optimized NumPy that is statically compiled via Numba’s pycc. LiCoRICE is not only suitable for systems neuroscience research, but also for applications requiring closed-loop realtime data processing from robotics and control systems to interactive applications and quantitative financial trading.},

  abstract = {Exact solving of systems of linear equations (SLEs) is a fundamental subroutine within number theory, formal verification of mathematical proofs, and exact-precision mathematical programming. Moreover, efficient exact SLE solution methods could be valuable for a growing body of science and engineering applications where current fixed-precision standards have been deemed inadequate. This article contains key derivations relating, and computational tests comparing, two exact direct solution frameworks: roundoff-error-free (REF) LU factorization and rational arithmetic LU factorization. Specifically, both approaches solve the linear system
            Ax
            =
            b

            =
            LU
            . Most significantly, the featured findings reveal that the integer-preserving REF factorization framework solves dense SLEs one order of magnitude faster than the exact rational arithmetic approach while requiring half the memory. Since rational LU is utilized for basic solution validation in exact linear and mixed-integer programming, these results offer preliminary evidence of the potential of the REF factorization framework to be utilized within this specific context. Additionally, this article develops and analyzes an efficient streamlined version of Edmonds’s Q-matrix approach that can be implemented as another basic solution validation approach. Further experiments demonstrate that the REF factorization framework also outperforms this alternative integer-preserving approach in terms of memory requirements and computational effort. General purpose codes to solve dense SLEs exactly via any of the aforementioned methods have been made available to the research and academic communities.},

            modular analysis and unified derivatives
            (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

This involves showing that the syntactic category associated to a type theory with weak identity types carries the structure of a path category, strengthening earlier results by Avigad, Lumsdaine, and Kapulkin. In this way, we not only relate a well-known concept in homotopy theory with a natural concept in logic but also provide a framework for further developments.},

In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
          We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which allow us to define syntax-preserving operators for satisfying preservation and support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones, but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
          To evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our operators. We further compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and generalise the other method.},

We develop a theory of single-point refutable specifications that facilitate generating concrete counterexamples using constraint solvers.

These models are based on the map-reduce paradigm where the input is transformed into a dataset of key-value pairs, and on each key a local computation is performed on the values associated with that key resulting in another set of key-value pairs. Computation proceeds in a constant number of rounds, where the result of the last round is the input to the next round, and transformation of key-value pairs is required to be generic. The difference between the three models is in the local computation part. In DSAs it is limited to making one pass over its input using a register automaton, while in DSTs it can make two passes: in the first pass it uses a finite state automaton and in the second it uses a register transducer. The third model DSTJs is an extension of DSTs, where local computations are capable of constructing the Cartesian product of two sets. We obtain the following results: (1) DSAs can evaluate first-order queries over bounded degree databases; (2) DSTs can evaluate semijoin algebra queries over arbitrary databases; (3) DSTJs can evaluate the whole relational algebra over arbitrary databases; (4) DSTJs are strictly stronger than DSTs, which in turn are strictly stronger than DSAs; (5) within DSAs, DSTs, and DSTJs, there is a strict hierarchy w.r.t. the number of rounds.},

            Propositional Abstract Separation Logics
            (PASLs), extend the logic of (Boolean) Bunched Implications (BBI) in various ways. In particular, these logics contain the connectives * and –*, denoting the composition and extension of resources, respectively.
          
          This added expressive power comes at a price, since the resulting logics are all undecidable. Given their wide applicability, even a semi-decision procedure for these logics is desirable. Although several PASLs and their relationships with BBI are discussed in the literature, the proof theory of, and automated reasoning for, these logics were open problems solved by the conference version of this article, which developed a modular proof theory for various PASLs using cut-free labelled sequent calculi. This paper non-trivially improves upon this previous work by giving a general framework of calculi on which any new axiom in the logic satisfying a certain form corresponds to an inference rule in our framework, and the completeness proof is generalised to consider such axioms.
          Our base calculus handles Calcagno et al.’s original logic of separation algebras by adding sound rules for partial-determinism and cancellativity, while preserving cut-elimination. We then show that many important properties in separation logic, such as indivisible unit, disjointness, splittability, and cross-split, can be expressed in our general axiom form. Thus, our framework offers inference rules and completeness for these properties for free. Finally, we show how our calculi reduce to calculi with global label substitutions, enabling more efficient implementation.},

  abstract = {Most current information systems security theories assume a rational actor making deliberate decisions, yet recent research in psychology suggests that such deliberate thinking is not as common as we would expect. Much of human behavior is controlled by nonconscious automatic cognition (called System 1 cognition). The deliberate rational cognition of System 2 is triggered when System 1 detects something that is not normal; otherwise we often operate on autopilot. When we do engage System 2 cognition, it is influenced by the System 1 cognition that preceded it. In this paper we present an alternative theoretical approach to information security that is based on the nonconscious automatic cognition of System 1. In a System 1 world, cognition is a sub-second process of pattern-matching a stimulus to an existing person-context heuristic. These person-context heuristics are influenced by personality characteristics and a lifetime of experiences in the context. Thus System 1 theories are closely tied to individuals and the specific security context of interest. Methods to improve security compliance take on a very new form; the traditional approaches to security education and training that provide guidelines and ways to think about security have no effect when behavior is controlled by System 1, because System 1 cognition is instant pattern matching not deliberative. Thus in a System 1 world, we improve security by changing the heuristics used by System 1's pattern matching and/or by changing what System 1 sees as "normal" so that it triggers the deliberate cognition of System 2. In this article, we examine System 1 and System 2 cognition, while calling for increased research to develop theories of System 1 cognition in the cybersecurity literature.},

An active line of research in behavioral economics and related fields has developed and analyzed models for this type of time-inconsistent behavior.
          Here we propose a graph-theoretic model of tasks and goals, in which dependencies among actions are represented by a directed graph, and a time-inconsistent agent constructs a path through this graph. We first show how instances of this path-finding problem on different input graphs can reconstruct a wide range of qualitative phenomena observed in the literature on time-inconsistency, including procrastination, abandonment of long-range tasks, and the benefits of reduced sets of choices. We then explore a set of analyses that quantify over the set of all graphs; among other results, we find that in any graph, there can be only polynomially many distinct forms of time-inconsistent behavior; and any graph in which a time-inconsistent agent incurs significantly more cost than an optimal agent must contain a large "procrastination" structure as a minor. Finally, we use this graph-theoretic model to explore ways in which tasks can be designed to motivate agents to reach designated goals.},

  abstract = {Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is one of the most promising candidates in the search for a logic capturing P
            time
            . The question whether there is a logic that expresses exactly the polynomial-time computable properties of finite structures, which has been open for more than 30 years, is one of the most important and challenging problems in finite model theory.
          
          
            The strength of Choiceless Polynomial Time is its ability to perform isomorphism-invariant
            computations
            over structures, using hereditarily finite sets as data structures. But, because of isomorphism-invariance, it is choiceless in the sense that it cannot select an arbitrary element of a set—an operation that is crucial for many classical algorithms. CPT can define many interesting P
            time
            queries, including (a certain version of) the Cai-Fürer-Immerman (CFI) query. The CFI-query is particularly interesting, because it separates fixed-point logic with counting from P
            time
            and has since remained the main benchmark for the expressibility of logics within P
            time
            .
          
          The CFI-construction associates with each connected graph a set of CFI-graphs that can be partitioned into exactly two isomorphism classes called odd and even CFI-graphs. The problem is to decide, given a CFI-graph, whether it is odd or even. For the case where the CFI-graphs arise from ordered graphs, Dawar, Richerby, and Rossman proved that the CFI-query is CPT-definable. However, definability of the CFI-query over general graphs remains open.
          Our first contribution generalises the result by Dawar, Richerby, and Rossman to the variant of the CFI-query derived from graphs with colour classes of logarithmic size, instead of colour class size one. Second, we consider the CFI-query over graph classes where the maximal degree is linear in the size of the graphs. For the latter, we establish CPT-definability using only sets of small, constant rank, which is known to be impossible for the general case.
          In our CFI-recognising procedures we strongly make use of the ability of CPT to create sets, rather than tuples only, and we further prove that, if CPT worked over tuples instead, then no such procedure would be definable. We introduce a notion of “sequencelike objects” based on the structure of the graphs’ symmetry groups, and we show that no CPT-program that only uses sequencelike objects can decide the CFI-query over complete graphs, which have linear maximal degree. From a broader perspective, this generalises a result by Blass, Gurevich, and van den Bussche about the power of isomorphism-invariant machine models (for polynomial time) to a setting with counting.},

This article introduces a number of type systems for nominal terms of increasing sophistication and demonstrates their application in the areas of rewriting and equational reasoning. Two simple type systems inspired by Church’s simply typed lambda calculus are presented where only well-typed terms are considered to exist, over which α-equivalence is then axiomatised. The first requires atoms to be strictly annotated whilst the second explores the consequences of a more relaxed de Bruijn-style approach in the presence of atom-capturing substitution. A final type system of richer ML-like polymorphic types is then given in the style of Curry, in which elements of the term language are deemed typeable or not only subsequent to the definition of alpha-equivalence. Principal types are shown to exist and an inference algorithm given to compute them. This system is then used to define two presentations of typed nominal rewriting, one more expressive and one more efficient, the latter also giving rise to a notion of typed nominal equational reasoning.},

We reach these results for a strict notion of type assignment for λ μ that is the natural restriction of the domain-based system of van Bakel et al. (2011) for λ μ by limiting the type inclusion relation to just intersection elimination. We show that this system respects β μ-equality, by showing both soundness and completeness results. We then define a notion of reduction on derivations that corresponds to cut-elimination, and show that this is strongly normalisable.
          We use this strong normalisation result to show an approximation result, and through that a characterisation of head-normalisation. Using the approximation result, we show that there is a very strong relation between the system of van Bakel et al. (2011) and ours.
          We then introduce a notion of type assignment that eliminates ω as an assignable type, and show, using the strong normalisation result for derivation reduction, that all terms typeable in this system are strongly normalisable as well, and show that all strongly normalisable terms are typeable.

We also present a theoretical analysis of basic transformation mechanisms; combining these basic mechanisms allows more flexibility of final designs.
