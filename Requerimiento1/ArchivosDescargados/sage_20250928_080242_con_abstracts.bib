  abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital animation industry, the role of dynamic light and shadow effects in improving the visual expressiveness of animation works has become increasingly prominent. However, traditional light and shadow design methods often rely on manual adjustment, which is inefficient and difficult to achieve complex dynamic effects. Therefore, this study proposes an animation effect design model based on a dynamic light and shadow algorithm, aiming at achieving efficient and realistic light and shadow effects through algorithm-driven. Firstly, the limitations of existing light and shadow algorithms in animation applications are analyzed, and then a dynamic light and shadow algorithm which combines a physical illumination model and artistic style is designed according to the characteristics of animation art. The algorithm calculates the position, intensity, and surface properties of the light source in real-time and generates light and shadow effects that conform to the animation style. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, an experimental platform was constructed in this study, and various animation scenes were tested. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional manual design, the model improves the efficiency of light and shadow effect generation by about 60%, and at the same time, it won more than 80% of the audience’s praise in the visual effect satisfaction survey. In addition, the research also optimizes the performance of the model. By introducing parallel computing and caching mechanisms, the light and shadow generation time is further shortened, and the resource consumption is reduced. This study not only provides a new technical path for animation light and shadow design but also provides a useful reference for the research in related fields.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, the importance of English word sense comparison classification has become increasingly prominent in areas such as semantic understanding and machine translation. The research results in this field play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of language processing systems. However, most existing English word sense comparison classification methods currently have significant shortcomings when dealing with complex semantic relationships. They struggle to accurately capture long-distance dependencies between words and exhibit weak discrimination capabilities when handling polysemy and synonyms, posing challenges in building high-performance comparison classification systems. The limitations of existing methods are mainly reflected in two aspects: on one hand, traditional models find it difficult to effectively extract semantic features when processing long sentences and complex semantic structures; on the other hand, a single model cannot simultaneously account for sequence information retention and long-distance dependency capture, leading to limited classification accuracy. This research focuses on these issues by proposing the construction of an English word sense comparison classification system using Transformer and LSTM. The self-attention mechanism of the Transformer can effectively capture long-distance dependencies between words, enhancing the ability to extract semantic features; the memory functionality of LSTM preserves sequence information, and the combination of the two optimizes classification performance. In our experiments, we constructed an English word sense comparison dataset containing 10,000-word pairs and used cross-validation for evaluation. The results show that, compared to the classification accuracy of the single Transformer model at 80.2% and the LSTM model at 78.9%, the Transformer LSTM model improved the classification accuracy to 85.6%, achieving an average percentage improvement of 5.4% and 6.7%. In the comparison tasks dealing with polysemy and synonyms, the model reached accuracies of 88.3% and 86.1%, respectively, demonstrating excellent discrimination capabilities and stable performance in handling complex semantic relationships and long sentences, significantly outperforming traditional models.},

  abstract = {Video data protection is a prominent area of research. Researchers have proposed several coding techniques to ensure the secure and efficient transmission of video data. Compressed code stream video encryption is an advanced method designed to enhance security and protection by encrypting video data at the compressed code stream level. Leveraging the advantages of compressed video streams, this approach maximizes encryption efficiency without compromising playback speed or video quality. In this research, we first compress the raw video data into a compressed code stream using the H.264/AVC technique. A common method encodes multiple independent slices into a video. We utilize this functionality to implement the ChaCha20 stream cipher for encryption. The cryptographic key derivation function (KDF) generates and updates the key dynamically. To enhance the security of video encryption, we propose a novel multi-key verifiable homomorphic lightweight cryptosystem (MKVHLC) to guarantee data privacy. In our experiments, we evaluated the proposed method using various reference video sequences featuring motion, texture, and objects.},

  abstract = {Ventilation plays a crucial role in influencing airflow and particle dispersion, highlighting the importance of effective systems to mitigate the spread of viruses in indoor spaces. While most research has concentrated on non-residential buildings, less attention has been given to optimizing ventilation in residential settings. This study examines a typical ventilation system in a detached house in British Columbia, Canada, using Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing airborne infection risks. The study investigates eight different scenarios, varying diffuser locations (near the ceiling and floor), two types of ventilation rates based on standards, and the positioning of the infected individual while considering flow, heat, and particle dynamics. The concentration of injected and distributed particles is used to assess infection probabilities as an additional risk indicator. In addition, the Wells-Riley model is applied to quantify the infection probability. The results indicate that the location of the infected person and diffuser placement significantly impact particle dispersion and infection risk, with near-ceiling outlets generally reducing concentrations more effectively than near-floor outlets. Higher ventilation rates decrease particle concentration when diffusers are near the ceiling but can increase concentrations with near-floor diffusers due to turbulence. Optimizing diffuser placement and ventilation rates is crucial for minimizing airborne transmission in residential settings.},

  abstract = {With the rapid use of electric vehicles (EVs), the need for intelligent and real-time fault diagnosis systems for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has become critical to ensure safety, efficiency, and extended operational life. Numerous existing fault diagnosis approaches often require complex computations and fail to adapt to nonlinear, dynamic EV conditions. In addition, data-driven models lack real-time capability, exhibit high computational overhead, and are rarely optimized for embedded deployment. This research presents a hybrid DL-based diagnostic framework named Optimized Elman Spotted Hyena Tuned NeuroNet (OESH-Net) for accurate State of Charge (SOC) estimation and fault detection in EV battery systems. The proposed model integrates a Thevenin-equivalent circuit-based LIB model simulated in MATLAB with a recurrent Elman Neural Network (ENN) optimized using the Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO) in TensorFlow/Keras. High-frequency sensor data, including voltage, current, temperature, motor speed, and hall signals, are collected and preprocessed using low-pass filtering, sliding window segmentation, and min-max normalization, to create structured feature vectors. Then, the preprocessed data are fed into the OESH-Net for SOC prediction and health classification into Normal, Warning, and Fault states based on residual SOC error thresholds. Experimental results shows that OESH-Net outperforms models’ sin both charging and discharging phases, achieving 98.86% accuracy, 99.22% F1-score, 0.00078 MSE, and 4.85 ms inference time. It maintains robust performance with a mean absolute SOC estimation error of 2.06%. The proposed OESH-Net framework enables predictive maintenance and early fault detection, offering a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for smart EV battery management systems.},

This research presents an AI-powered Feedback Analytics Engine designed to optimize the quality assessment of vocational education by systematically collecting, processing, and analyzing feedback from diverse educational sources. The system aggregates data from student surveys, instructor evaluations, learning management system logs, and classroom observations, enabling a holistic view of the teaching and learning environment. Textual data is preprocessed using natural language techniques (NLP), such as cleaning and tokenization. To address data imbalance challenges, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed, ensuring equal representation across various performance levels and enhancing model generalizability. Feature extraction is performed using Word2Vec, which captures semantic relationships within the feedback to generate rich vector representations. A Modified Migrating Birds Optimizer-driven Attention-based Recurrent neural network (MMB-Att-RNN) model is used to evaluate vocational education quality, which enables collaborative, distributed training across multiple institutions while preserving data privacy. An integrated attention mechanism helps the model focus on the most relevant features within the feedback, thereby improving prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed engine demonstrates superior performance, significantly outperforming traditional models with an accuracy of 98.42%. The results appear in the form of an interactive dashboard that enables educators and administrators to track the effectiveness of their instruction, areas of improvement, and evidence-based decision making.

  abstract = {Chinese figure painting, with its rich history and diverse styles, represents a significant cultural heritage that captures the essence of Chinese art and aesthetics. However, many traditional figure painting styles, particularly rare ones, remain underrepresented and face considerable challenges in modern-day recognition, categorization, and preservation. This issue is especially prominent in the context of few-shot learning, where models must classify and identify rare categories with only minimal training data. To address this challenge, the research proposes a novel meta-learning-optimized deep feature fusion strategy for the few-shot classification of rare Chinese figure painting styles. The research utilizes a Chinese art styles dataset of Chinese figure paintings, with a specific focus on rare and fine-grained styles. Preprocessing steps such as image resizing and noise removal were employed to enhance data quality. The ResNet-50 model was utilized to extract low-level characteristics from the input images, such as edges, textures, and colors. The features extracted from different layers were then fused using deep feature fusion techniques to create a comprehensive and discriminative representation of the painting styles. This feature fusion process was further optimized through a meta-learning approach based on the Elephant Clan Optimized Attention-based Variational Autoencoder (ECO-Att-VAE) method, which fine-tunes feature weighting based on the support set in the few-shot classification task. Experiments show that the suggested strategy works noticeably better than current methods in the categorization of unusual art styles. Results show that the model achieves a notable improvement in classification accuracy, providing a robust and effective solution for few-shot classification in the domain of rare Chinese figure painting styles.},

Influencing factors of tourism efficiency were further examined through a Tobit model. The results indicate that, from a static efficiency perspective, only Chizhou was strongly DEA efficient, while the remaining 15 cities were DEA inefficient. From a dynamic efficiency perspective, in the temporaldimension, the total factor productivity (TFP) index of Anhui Province’s tourism industry demonstrated an overall upward trend, with an average annual growth rate of 11.6% in tourism efficiency in the prefecture-level city dimension, an overall increase in tourism efficiency was observed, although variations in growth magnitude were identified. In the regional dimension, the Central Anhui region exhibited the highest tourism efficiency, followed by Southern Anhui, with Northern Anhui displaying the lowest efficiency levels. Economic development and transportation accessibility were found to promote tourism efficiency, while the degree of openness and tourism resource endowment exerted a suppressive effect.

  abstract = {Classical Chinese literary texts, such as poetry and prose, are rich in emotional and cultural expression but pose significant challenges for computational analysis due to their archaic language, symbolic structures, and lack of punctuation. Traditional sentiment analysis models often fail to capture the depth and nuance of these texts, limiting their effectiveness in literary interpretation and digital humanities research. This research aims to develop a deep learning (DL)-based RoCoSenti-Classical framework tailored to classical Chinese literature, capable of accurately identifying and classifying sentiments despite the language’s complexity and historical nature. A comprehensive corpus of classical Chinese literary texts was gathered from reputable digital sources. The text data underwent pre-processing steps, including text normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal. Domain-specific language representations were created by fine-tuning RoBERTa embeddings on the classical corpus. These embeddings were then input into a ConvLSTM model, which combines convolutional layers for local feature extraction with LSTM layers for progressive sentiment modeling. Implemented in Python, the findings show that the RoCoSenti-Classical framework performs better than multimodal baseline architectures, achieving superior results with accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision ranging from 90% to 97%. The suggested RoCoSenti-Classical framework effectively captures complex emotional cues in classical texts, demonstrating robustness across different literary genres and significantly improving sentiment analysis performance for classical Chinese literature. These findings support the broader integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital humanities and open new avenues for the computational interpretation of ancient texts.},

  abstract = {This study addresses critical gaps in cultural education by establishing a comprehensive framework that operationalizes situated learning theory through culturally-constrained multi-sensor data fusion algorithms to create immersive Chinese cultural learning environments. The research employed a pre-post control group experimental design with 120 university participants (60 experimental, 60 control) over 12-week learning periods. The cultural-constraint multi-sensor fusion algorithm integrated traditional Chinese aesthetic principles into mathematical optimization processes, while virtual environments incorporated authentic cultural practices including calligraphy, tea ceremony, and guqin performance through high-resolution RGB-D cameras, haptic feedback systems, and natural language processing capabilities. Experimental groups demonstrated 26.2% superior learning outcomes compared to traditional instruction methods while maintaining 94.2% cultural authenticity preservation. The system achieved 99.3% operational stability with 94.7 fps rendering performance. Longitudinal assessments revealed 85.1% enhanced cultural identity formation and sustained learning motivation throughout six-month follow-up periods, with virtual cultural communities facilitating 4.7 times more peer interactions than conventional classroom settings. The integration validates that educational theory-driven computational innovations can transcend traditional classroom limitations by creating persistent communities of practice that preserve cultural transmission integrity while leveraging contemporary technological capabilities. This framework provides robust foundations for advancing cultural education digitization, establishing precedents for intelligent educational algorithms guided by learning theory principles and virtual learning community architectures optimized through educational science insights.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Topological Optimization Homotopy Framework (TOHF) and provide the first rigorous proof of its global convergence to solve the non-convex optimization challenges in high-dimensional tensor decomposition. TOHF transforms the tensor algebraic structure into topological invariants to construct two-layer manifold optimization paths with global guidance. By integrating homotopy parameter scheduling and curvature correction, it overcomes the saddle-dominated energy landscape. Theoretically, TOHF achieves global convergence under the Wasserstein topological distance. Experiments in recommender systems, medical imaging, and neural network compression show that TOHF provides significant improvements in accuracy and convergence efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively mitigating local minima traps, accelerating objective function descent, and enhancing solution set stability. This study establishes a topology-based convergence analysis paradigm for high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems, which is of theoretical guidance for large-scale data processing applications.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of globalization, intangible cultural heritage has become an important resource for protecting national culture and promoting social development. However, research on its geographical distribution and potential mechanisms is still insufficient, especially in the use of spatial statistics and geographic information systems for analysis and management. This study uses GIS technology and spatial statistical methods, including spatial autocorrelation, hotspot analysis, and geographically weighted regression (GWR), to explore the spatial distribution of China’s intangible cultural heritage. This study analyzed data from national intangible cultural heritage projects to reveal regional characteristics and distribution patterns. The research results show that intangible cultural heritage has significant regional agglomeration, with high-density areas concentrated in the eastern coastal areas and around major cities, while the density is lower in the western and remote areas. In addition, factors such as geographical location, economic development, and population density have a significant impact on distribution. About 55% of intangible cultural heritage projects in China are concentrated in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial pattern of intangible cultural heritage and scientific basis for effective cultural protection and policy formulation. These findings can guide local governments in allocating resources, formulating strategies for cultural heritage protection and inheritance, especially in balancing the urban-rural gap.},

  abstract = {With the progress of globalization, English learning has become an important topic in education. However, the traditional teaching mode makes it difficult to meet individualized learning needs, resulting in uneven learning effects. Therefore, this study aims to build a personalized English learning path optimization system based on MVO-CNN (multiverse optimization-convolutional neural networks) to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness. There are some problems in English learning, such as scattered resources and single methods, which are difficult to adapt to the characteristics and needs of different learners. As an advanced artificial intelligence technology, MVO-CNN can effectively process complex learning data and provide strong support for personalized learning. In the system construction process, we first collected English learning data, including learners’ basic information, study habits, and achievement records. Then, MVO-CNN is used to mine and analyze the data deeply to identify the key factors affecting the learning effect. Based on these factors, the system generates personalized learning paths for each learner, including recommended learning resources, learning plans and learning methods. We conducted a 3-month experiment with 500 learners participating to verify the system’s effectiveness. The experimental results show that learners who use personalized learning paths have an average improvement of 15% in English scores, a 20% reduction in learning time and a 30% increase in learning satisfaction. In addition, the system’s recommendation accuracy rate reaches 85%, better than the 60% of the traditional teaching mode.

Results showed that the combination of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling and kernel extreme learning machine achieved the best detection performance for ADA, TalcP, and GypsumP.

Traditional recommendation algorithms often face problems such as insufficient feature extraction and low recommendation accuracy when dealing with large-scale and high-dimensional music data. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent music personalized recommendation algorithm based on efficient feature extraction of MLP-Mixer. The algorithm uses MLP-Mixer’s multi-layer perceptron network to effectively capture deep-seated features in music data, thereby improving the accuracy and diversity of the recommendation system. In the experimental session, we constructed a dataset containing 100,000 songs and 1 million user ratings, using mean square error (MSE) and Accuracy as evaluation indicators. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional recommendation algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the MSE index by 15% and improves the Accuracy index by 8%. In addition, the user satisfaction survey shows that the user satisfaction of the recommendation system using the new algorithm has increased by 12%, significantly enhancing the user experience. This study not only verifies the effectiveness of MLP-Mixer in music feature extraction but also provides a new technical path for intelligent music personalized recommendation.},

During the experiment, students who worked with robots demonstrated superior performance in areas such as solving complex problems, improving programming skills and developing algorithmic thinking. The increased effectiveness of the educational process is attributed to the interactive and practice-oriented nature of robotics, which enables students to not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also apply it in practical contexts. Furthermore, participation in such processes fosters the development of additional skills, including teamwork, rapid decision-making and adaptability to changing conditions.

  abstract = {Industrial electrical automation fault detection is a guarantee for the stable operation of industrial systems. Focusing on issues of low detection accuracy and insufficient depth perception ability in the current research, this paper establishes a multimetric stereo vision measurement model of electrical equipment, and stereo-corrects the images of electrical equipment. Then a two-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to capture global and local characteristics of the electrical equipment image. Finally, the YOLOv8 approach was adopted as the baseline model to optimize the design of the feature fusion part of the network. The recognition head network was superseded by Dyhead dynamic recognition head. The loss function part is redesigned using Focaler-IoU to solve the fitting problem caused by sample imbalance. Experimental outcome indicates that the proposed technique boosts the mean Average Precision (mAP) by no less than 5.42%, which significantly improves the detection efficiency and reliability.},

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of digital music content, efficient and accurate methods for music feature extraction and style generation have become critical research areas in music information processing. Traditional manual labeling methods are insufficient to manage large-scale music data due to their inefficiency and subjectivity. Deep learning technologies, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown significant promise in capturing temporal and stylistic characteristics of musical sequences. This paper introduces an integrated framework that combines spectral and cepstral analyses—applying short-time Fourier transform on overlapping 20 ms frames with 10 ms hops and extracting log-power cepstrum plus Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)—to systematically derive pitch, resonance peaks, and timbre features. These handcrafted vectors are concatenated with learned embeddings and fed into a bidirectional LSTM, enabling the model to leverage both explicit frequency-domain cues and long-range temporal dependencies. By processing each sequence in forward and backward directions, the bidirectional LSTM outperforms unidirectional variants in genre classification accuracy and produces more coherent musical transitions. In tests on five genres (Jazz, Classical, Rock, Country, and Disco), our framework achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.2%, an F1-score of 0.79, and a Mean Opinion Score of 4.1/5 for stylistic coherence in a blind listening study. Additionally, quantitative evaluation of harmonic progression consistency (85% retention of original chord transitions) and dynamic contour reproduction (Pearson correlation of 0.82 with source note velocities) demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize to non-genre-specific musical elements. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method generates high-quality, stylistically faithful music across diverse genres, offering an automated, efficient solution for both music analysis and creative generation.},

A comprehensive analysis of research on healthy cities can provide valuable insights into the current state of the field and guide future development directions. This study utilizes the CiteSpace literature analysis tool and examines literature from the Web of Science and CNKI databases over the past three decades to identify relevant research papers. Employing visual analytics techniques, it explores research hotspots, authors, and institutions to extract key findings and identify areas for further improvement in the research of healthy cities. The analysis reveals several important observations: Firstly, international research primarily focuses on individual health from a biomedical perspective, while Chinese studies place greater emphasis on the impact of the built environment and urban planning, yet less consideration is given to the psychological consideration of human health. Secondly, the major of professional international authors in the field of urban health are concentrated in Europe and Australia, where influential Chinese authors are mainly affiliated with institutions in Shanghai and Beijing, indicating the regional characteristics of China’s health city research and its concentrated development in these cities. This statistical result reveals the differences in contributions of different regions in the field of health city research, while reflecting the geographical distribution bias of research resources and forces. Furthermore, universities are the dominant research institutions in both Chinese and international contexts. Lastly, this study synthesizes the theoretical foundations, empirical results, construction evaluation, and governance measures of healthy cities, and provides four constructive suggestions for future development: refining the theoretical framework of healthy cities, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, expanding the assessment system and methods, and implementing comprehensive governance strategies that encompass various dimensions of health.},

  abstract = {Predicting crack propagation in a composite airfield pavement is a computationally challenging task. This study presents the development of a fracture-based modeling approach to capture crack propagation in an asphalt concrete (AC) overlay on jointed Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement structure. A four-stage numerical framework was developed to predict thermal induced joint reflective cracking. The framework leverages a combination of finite difference methods, finite element (FE) thermo-mechanical modeling, and the Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) coupled with the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (EVCP). FE thermo-mechanical and GFEM fracture simulations were solved in 3-D. Performing the simulations in 3-D domain shows the non-uniformity of PCC joint movement through the depth and width of the concrete slabs. The results show that this non-uniformity is mainly influenced by AC stiffness and thermal expansion/contraction. Simplified design models were prepared for joint opening under different cooling cycles. GFEM s adaptive meshing and global-local analysis enable accurate calculation of stress intensity factors from the elastic solution. Application of EVCP provided the ability to address the critical challenges of incorporating 3-D viscoelastic analysis within the framework. Using EVCP viscoelastic ERR can be calculated for various AC mixtures and cooling cycles using a limited set of elastic solutions. The framework was validated using FAA outdoor test section for joint reflective cracking at the National Airport Pavement Test Facility. Thermal reflective cracking performance for different overlay scenarios was simulated in four different climatic regions, highlighting the framework s ability of capturing the effect of pavement structure and climate on overlay fatigue life.},

This study details the design and implementation of an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) pedagogical framework for mental health courses in higher vocational education settings. The research addresses the limitations of conventional pedagogical approaches through the use of immersive VR technology to create experiential learning spaces that foster the development of psychological resilience. Through a mixed-methods research design, we created an extensive VR-based curriculum with four main modules: stress management simulation, social interaction training, problem-solving under pressure, and exercises on emotional regulation. A 12 week experiment was carried out with 200 higher vocational students, comparing the effects of the VR intervention group with a control group receiving conventional instruction. Quantitative results revealed significant improvements in psychological resilience scores (Cohen’s d = 0.78,
            p

Qualitative findings revealed significant improvements in student engagement, skill transfer to real-life situations, and self-efficacy in coping with psychological adversity. The virtual reality (VR) model showed greater educational efficacy in terms of knowledge retention, with a 23% improvement, as well as in practical skill application, which showed a 31% improvement compared to traditional learning methods. This study presents an empirically supported model for incorporating VR technology in mental health training, providing data-driven recommendations for its use in professional settings and opening the door for new approaches utilizing VR technology to enhance psychological resilience.},

  abstract = {Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face significant difficulties in emotional expression and recognition, and traditional manual observation methods struggle to capture their weak and transient micro-expression features. To address this issue, this paper proposes an autism emotion recognition model that integrates Vision Transformer with multimodal features. The model first employs the TVL1 optical flow algorithm to extract facial motion features and utilizes Vision Transformer to model long-range dependencies between different facial regions. Subsequently, it introduces a feature selection fusion module (FSFM) to filter key image patches, a cross-attention fusion module (CAFM) to integrate horizontal and vertical optical flow information, and designs a spatial consistency attention module (SCAM) to ensure feature distribution consistency. Finally, it incorporates Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML) to optimize the feature space structure. On standard micro-expression databases including MMEW, CASMEII, and SAMM, this method achieves recognition accuracies significantly superior to existing approaches (73.0%, 76.4%, and 70.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates good generalization capability and real-time performance, showing promise as an intelligent assistive tool for special education to enhance teachers’ understanding of emotional states in children with autism and improve intervention efficiency, thereby promoting personalized education development.},

  abstract = {As technology advances, the demands for precise industrial product manufacturing increase. Consequently, measuring instruments have also improved in accuracy. To ensure that the measurement accuracy of the three-coordinate measuring instrument meets modern industrial manufacturing’s precision measurement requirements, the quantity traceability method is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy of angle error. And the geometric error compensation method is used to improve the measurement accuracy of the coordinate measuring instrument. By establishing a complete, accurate, and reliable traceability chain, the coordinate measuring instrument has traceability and calibration functions. Error compensation improves the geometric error in the coordinate measuring instrument through operation command correction. The results showed that the phase relationship of the measurement error of the self-calibrating encoder was basically consistent with the design value. Compared to the R1 reading head, the deviation value of the R6 reading head was the smallest, at 0.1°. The deviation value of the R4 and R5 reading heads was larger, at 0.4° compared to the R1 reading head. The deviation values of the R2 and R3 reading heads compared to the R1 reading head were 0.3° and 0.2°, respectively. The precision error compensation model had a higher degree of error identification and accuracy. In measuring errors in the three axes, the outcomes of the traditional error model show greater variability as the displacement increases. The method of error compensation in the measurement system effectively improves accuracy by reducing errors. This method not only proves the feasibility of accuracy improvement but also provides guidance for further enhancements of the measurement system’s accuracy.},

In this study, we introduce an end-to-end dual-stream approach for human action recognition that leverages global and local feature representations in conjunction with conditional random fields. The proposed framework adopts a dual-stream network design, where spatial and temporal cues from video frames are initially extracted using the ViBe algorithm (enhanced with a flicker coefficient) and the unsupervised TV-Net, respectively. These features are separately fed into the corresponding spatial and temporal branches of the network for pre-training and subsequent feature extraction. A parallel fusion mechanism is then applied to integrate the outputs from both streams, thereby enriching the descriptive power of the learned features. For the final stage, an improved anisotropic Markov random field model is employed for network training and result refinement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets—UCF101, HMDB51—as well as a proprietary Fujian electric power measurement action dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior robustness and high recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

The model was analysed under physiological grasping loads to examine axial load distributions and articular contact pressures at the radioscaphoid and radiolunate interfaces. The fused complex becomes a major load-bearing structure, while radiocarpal contact pressures at both the radioscaphoid and radiolunate interfaces show reductions compared with the intact model. This altered load distribution pattern suggests significant biomechanical adaptations after the procedure and supports its use for scapholunate instability and the treatment of Kienböck’s disease.},

To address this problem, this paper constructs a real-time traveling wave monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing architecture and builds an efficient data processing link through the end-edge-cloud collaborative mechanism. The perception layer uses low-power IoT terminals to collect high-frequency electrical disturbance data. The edge layer deploys lightweight AI (Artificial Intelligence) models to extract signal features and trigger anomalies, significantly reducing the cloud load through localized preprocessing. The cloud relies on a distributed timing analysis engine to achieve deep fusion and precise positioning of multi-source data. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the designed system in 5G environment is 98.6% in traveling wave recognition; the fault location error is 110 m; the real-time response delay is only 28 milliseconds.

  abstract = {Traditional villages are favored by many tourism enthusiasts due to their unique historical heritage and cultural attributes. However, with the rapid increase in regional traffic flow, serious traffic congestion problems may arise in the area. In response to the above issues, the study adopts a dual level planning model to plan the transportation of traditional village contiguous development areas. The study first analyzes regional transportation issues and establishes a model of upper level influencing factors based on the current situation. Next, the study considers the balanced configuration of lower level transportation and constructs a lower level planning model. Finally, the study introduces linear constraint method and improved genetic algorithm to solve the two-layer model. In genetic algorithm optimization training, the search performance reaches its optimal level when the crossover probability is 0.9 and the population size is 40. When the weight of the upper model is (0.5, 0.5), the saturation of each section of the transportation network is within the expected range, and road planning proceeds smoothly. Comparing the actual planning effects of different traffic planning models, the study found that in the traffic planning of congested sections 6 and 10, the research model has good planning effects and is superior to other models. In the comparison of planning costs, the research model has lower costs in 1 km road planning and adding one lane planning.},

However, traditional semantic alignment methods are often limited by model size and computational efficiency, and it isn’t easy to meet the dual requirements of real-time and accuracy. This study aims to improve the performance of cross-border English text semantic alignment through BERT-INT8 quantitative model. We first perform INT8 quantization processing on the BERT model, significantly reducing the model parameters and computational complexity. The experimental results show that the semantic alignment accuracy of the optimized model has improved by 5.2% to 92.7%. The processing speed has been increased by 1.8 times, reaching the speed of processing 3000-word pairs per second. The average alignment accuracy on different types of text reached 90.5%, which was 4.3 percentage points higher than that of the unoptimized model. These results show that the BERT-INT8 quantization model significantly improves the processing efficiency while maintaining high alignment accuracy, with strong generalization ability and robustness. This study provides a new technical path for fast and accurate alignment of cross-border English texts, which can play an important role in practical applications.},

  abstract = {With the increasingly refined and intelligent requirements for lighting and sound in dance performances, the traditional synchronous control methods of lighting and sound have made it difficult to meet the complex needs of stage performances. This study proposes a lighting and sound synchronization control method based on an adaptive algorithm, which improves the system’s response speed and synchronization accuracy in a dynamic stage environment through technologies such as deep learning, reinforcement learning and model-free adaptive control. In the initial test of the synchronization control of light and sound in dance performance, it was found that the fit between the light brightness change and the sound rhythm was only 79.4%. In the process of stage performance, there is still much room for optimization in the synchronous control of lighting and sound. Especially in complex dance passages, there are significant delay and synchronization errors. In a dance paragraph with a duration of 18.53 s, the average delay time of light color conversion is 35.39 ms, while the delay of sound volume adjustment is 29.09 ms. With the change of stage performance rhythm, this delay problem may lead to the out-of-synchronization of the audience’s visual and auditory experience, thus affecting the expressiveness of the performance. In a specific stage scene, the movement deviation of the lighting position reaches 34.46 cm, while the spatial positioning deviation of the sound effect is 56.64 cm. In the initial test of the synchronization control of light and sound in dance performance, it was found that the fit between the light brightness change and the sound rhythm was only 79.4%. In the process of stage performance, there is still much room for optimization in the synchronous control of lighting and sound. Especially in complex dance passages—defined as segments with movement velocity exceeding 1.5 m/s, direction changes more than 3 times per second, or simultaneous variations in at least three signal modalities (e.g., dance movements, sound frequency, and light intensity)—there are significant delay and synchronization errors.},

  abstract = {Modern power systems, serving as the lifeline of societal operations, face challenges to their stability due to equipment damage and service interruptions caused by grid faults. Existing learning-based methods of-ten rely solely on structured data as features, where random fluctuations in the data can lead to overly sensitive fault predictions. To address this issue, this study innovatively integrates multi-dimensional in-formation from both structured and unstructured data, proposing the ALLA prediction framework based on the collaborative reasoning of Attention-LSTM and large language models. By dynamically filtering key features from structured data such as current and voltage through the attention mechanism, and leveraging the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models on unstructured texts like fault re-ports and maintenance logs, a dual-channel feature enhancement model is constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves an average F1 score of 0.9818 across five power grid datasets, representing a 2.4% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. This framework provides a new paradigm for resolving the sensitivity-accuracy trade-off in fault prediction under complex environments, significantly enhancing the accuracy of converter valve fault predictions.},

Unlike traditional learner profiling methods that rely on questionnaires and standardized assessments, our approach leverages natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and unsupervised learning to mine naturally occurring student-generated text. The key innovation lies in our integration of computational linguistics with educational theory to identify five distinct learner profiles (Academic Analytical, Innovative Thinker, Collaborative, Optimistic Active, and Expressive Rich Learner) along with specific trait labels that capture unique cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of learning. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness through experimental validation with both student self-assessment (78.2% agreement) and instructor evaluation, confirming that algorithmically-determined classifications strongly align with human perceptions. Our methodology establishes formal mapping relationships between extracted personalized labels and specific instructional strategies, enabling educators to tailor teaching approaches to individual learning profiles. By analyzing unstructured text that students naturally produce during their educational journey, we achieve non-intrusive learner profiling that provides insight into student learning characteristics. The methodology we’ve developed establishes a foundation that could potentially be extended to capture learning development over time in future longitudinal studies with larger samples. This work contributes to the advancement of adaptive education by bridging the gap between computational data analysis and practical pedagogical interventions, ultimately supporting the development of more responsive and personalized learning environments.},

  abstract = {With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent digital art design gradually integrates multi-modal data, such as images, text, and audio, in the creative process, improving the creativity and efficiency of design. Traditional art design platforms have problems such as insufficient information fusion and low creative efficiency when dealing with multi-modal data. In order to solve these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent digital art design fusion platform based on multi-modal Transformer, which effectively fuses data of different modalities through the multi-modal Transformer architecture to improve creative efficiency and work quality. The proposed multi-modal Transformer framework is a novel approach to digital art creation, overcoming traditional limitations of single-modal platforms by integrating image, text, and audio. This multi-modal fusion significantly enhances creative efficiency by 33.3% and creativity by improving both the diversity and expressiveness of the generated artworks, primarily within a unified image resolution framework. However, the current platform is optimized for fixed resolution image generation. Handling mixed resolutions or modified images (in pixel or grid formats) presents challenges, particularly in maintaining output integrity. This limitation is recognized and will be addressed in future work through adaptive resolution techniques. The innovation lies in effectively leveraging the self-attention mechanism to balance the computational load while enriching creative outputs, addressing both artistic and technological challenges. Specific data analysis shows that the average time of three-modal fusion creation design is 80 min, while that of single-modal creation is 120 min, which proves the significant advantages of multi-modal fusion in accelerating design creation. In addition, the platform has also achieved good results in the quality of creation, and the creative score has increased by about 25% compared with the traditional platform.},

This paper relays these calls for these catastrophic times by considering the manner in which philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers has approached this problem. Proffering an extended reading of the mutations of Stengers's thought in the last decade, it argues that one of the lessons of her work is to connect the planetary catastrophe to the devastation of our knowledge-practices and the depletion of our imaginations, and to give to the catastrophe that marks the present the power to transform our ways of thinking in common. Resisting the mobilizations engendered by the question “what is to be done?”, Stengers wagers on the generative capacities of interstitial practices to regenerate forms of collective intelligence, forms capable of protecting knowing and thinking practices from capture and experimentally reactivating the imagination even amid catastrophe. In so doing, the paper proffers a mode of imagining critical STS as an accomplice to collective experiments everywhere elaborating capacities to learn, for their own reasons, through their own means, how to pose their own questions.},

This study aims to explore a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for rumor detection in news communication that integrates an attention mechanism. By enriching and advancing the theoretical framework and technical methods in the field of rumor detection, it seeks to provide more accurate and reliable information support for Internet news communication. This study first analyzes the public opinion transmission cycle of Internet news. It makes it clear that the word vector model is the key link in the natural language processing task of news rumor detection. In the task of rumor detection, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) detection model is further proposed, which takes text information as input, extracts features, and learns optimal strategies through the deep neural network, to achieve accurate recognition of rumors. The attention mechanism is integrated into the model to help it better identify the key information in the text, such as keywords, key sentences, etc., thereby improving the accuracy of detection. On the Pheme Twitter and Weibo datasets, the DQN + Attention model proposed in this study has improved accuracy by 11.09% and 10.1% compared to the Long Short-Term Memory model. Compared with the Relay Diffusion Model, the proposed model’s accuracy on the two datasets is increased by 2.5% and 0.2%, respectively. This finding demonstrates that the model can still achieve or even surpass the effectiveness of complex models that combine multiple types of information even when using only textual information.

The existing approximate methods for this problem include traditional PID control systems and manual control mechanisms. These methods have some drawbacks, such as poor handling of nonlinear dynamics, long response times, and inability to optimize production in real time. To partially overcome these drawbacks, this manuscript proposes an implementation of a method based on deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks and long-term short-term memory networks. This method improves the performance of carbon fiber shaping machines by predicting and adjusting the filament conveying speed with higher accuracy and responsiveness. Compared with traditional PID control systems, the positive results of this method include a 38.2% improvement in control accuracy, a 22.3% reduction in response time, and a 10.5% increase in production efficiency. However, there are still some limitations, such as the challenge of integrating the system into existing manufacturing infrastructure and the need for further improvements in noise reduction technology. Future work will focus on addressing long-term system performance and maintenance, including periodic retraining of models to adapt to evolving production conditions. Regular maintenance of the system infrastructure, such as sensor calibration and data quality checks, will be necessary to ensure stable and efficient operation over extended periods.},

How to make university students have better emotion regulation ability so that they can better cope with various psychological problems is a point of great concern in current college education. In this article, a series of researches are conducted on the psychological health curriculum and university students’ emotion regulation ability.

  abstract = {The calculation of compaction degree for earth-rock dams based on non-embedded methods can assess compaction levels. However, due to the variability in the source, filling processes, and environmental conditions of earth-rock dams, the spatial distribution of fill materials is often uneven, particularly in mixed fill, leading to discrepancies in compaction degree and complicating assessment efforts. To enhance the accuracy of compaction degree evaluation, the latest deep learning Evo-Learn model is utilized to correct compaction parameters. This method employs a weight optimization strategy that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Backpropagation to optimize neural network weights, thereby improving model robustness and performance. Through selection, crossover, mutation, and other operations, the mixed error between the sample set and the test set is optimized, so as to improve the generalization performance of the compression prediction model and reduce overfitting.

How can drawing, cutting and pasting, repurposing objects, and photography enable us to explore complex, or hard-to-talk about experiences? What do we miss when we ask only with words, and not with action? This article explores these questions, demonstrating how to enact different arts-based research methods in practices of inquiry to open the process of thought and care in research related to public health. With reference to one line of inquiry as an exemplar – namely, how to promote care – this article reveals the complementary value of several arts-based research methods – these include: found objects; body mapping; collective collage making; and photography. This article: presents an overview of arts-based research methods, explaining what they are (and are not) and their purpose; demonstrates how arts-based research might be used to promote care; clarifies the benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations associated with arts-based research; and invites readers to consider how they might incorporate arts-based research in their scholarship, highlighting particular questions that warrant consideration.},

  abstract = {The present study offers an exploratory analysis of the creative processes and products at the heart of song lyric writing. Drawing on insights from creative metacognition research and work that integrates individual and collective aspects of creativity, we focus on instances where individuals generate artistic outcomes both for themselves and for others. Sixty-three participants (35 musical experts and 28 novices) were invited to complete a series of questionnaires and craft new lyrics for two distinct musical excerpts. They were instructed to write for either themselves (envisioning they would sing the final product) or for another individual (considering someone else would perform). The creativity of the lyrics was assessed using three complementary approaches: (i) self-ratings by participants, (ii) qualitative evaluations by six expert raters, and (iii) algorithmic analysis through distributional semantic modeling. Although we did not find significant differences in creativity between lyrics created for oneself and lyrics created for others, our analysis revealed that participants’ behaviors and states are more predictive of self-assessment and computational ratings of creativity than expert ratings. Furthermore, we identified a robust correlation between expert ratings and computational evaluations of the lyrics’ creativity.},

  abstract = {With the increasingly prominent mental health issues among college students, how to identify students with psychological abnormalities through behavioral data has become an urgent research problem to be solved. A Hybrid Model for Psychological Abnormal Student Behavior Identification (HMPABI) based on educational big data is proposed. By combining multidimensional behavioral characteristics and psychological assessment data of students during their school years, an efficient and accurate identification model for students with psychological abnormalities is constructed through clustering, oversampling techniques, and a mixed classification strategy of logistic regression and support vector machine. The study takes the Urumqi University Student Campus Behavior Dataset and the Adolescent Mental Health and Behavior Dataset for experimental verification. On the UUS-CBD dataset, the average absolute error of the HMPABI model was lower than that of other comparison models in all testing time windows, exhibiting higher prediction accuracy and stability, with a maximum error value of 0.28. In contrast, the errors of the other two models reached 0.45 and 0.42 at the maximum time window (45 min), respectively. The HMPBAI model can fully explore the potential information of students’ behavioral characteristics. By integrating different types of data, it can more accurately predict students with psychological abnormalities. This study provides a new technological path for monitoring and intervening in the mental health of college students and has high practical application value.},

It constructs a personalized recommendation system based on the self-attention mechanism, integrating deep learning algorithms to provide customized learning paths and resources for sports teaching. Implemented in a flipped classroom, the system collects and analyzes student learning data to optimize the personalized learning model. The study is conducted in a university sports course, dividing students into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group uses the flipped classroom model supported by the personalized recommendation system, while the control group follows the traditional teaching model. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the personalized recommendation system reaches 95.15%, significantly higher than other models (such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). The surveys indicate that the experimental group outperforms the control group in classroom participation, learning satisfaction, and problem-solving abilities, with statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). This demonstrates that the system significantly improves learning outcomes. The study concludes that the personalized recommendation system based on the self-attention mechanism can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional teaching models.

  abstract = {Economic globalization makes the technological innovation of enterprises become the key to win or lose in market competition. To improve the innovation ability of enterprises and enable them to achieve sustainable development, many enterprises have begun to carry out digital transformation (DT). Considering the financial risks existing in the DT of enterprises, a prediction model was first established based on convolution neural network (CNN) and entropy method, aiming at providing data reference for enterprises. To further study the relationship between DT and enterprise innovation (EI) development, three research hypotheses were given through theoretical analysis. The correlation was calculated by multiple linear regression. According to the results of financial risk simulation experiment, when the iterations was 1500, the prediction accuracy of GRA-Entropy-CNN was 93%. This was 2% and 8% higher than TOPSIS-Entropy-CNN and FCE-Entropy-CNN, respectively. The accuracy of GRA-Entropy-SOM-CNN was 92%, which was 12% higher than that of GRA-CRITIC-SOM-CNN. This shows that the combination of entropy method and grey correlation method with CNN can improve the prediction accuracy. The empirical analysis results show that the development of innovation will be positively affected by the transformation of digital technology, and its regression coefficient is 0.556, and the significance level is 0.001; the innovation development will be positively affected by the knowledge innovation ability, and its regression coefficient is 0.188, and the significance level is 0.001. The above results demonstrate that the combination of convolutional neural networks and entropy method can effectively improve the accuracy of financial risk prediction, and also prove that digital technology transformation can promote innovative development of enterprises, providing a theoretical basis for the formulation of strategies for enterprises in digital transformation.},

  abstract = {Objective
            
              Breast cancer stands as one of the most prevalent cancers globally, representing around 31% of new cancer diagnoses in women. The emergence of drug resistance undermines the efficacy of chemotherapy, highlighting the urgent need for alternative treatments. Ginger (
              Zingiber officinale
              ) is a dietary plant known for its different biological effects. Our goal was to isolate the cytotoxic compounds from the petroleum ether extract of dried ginger.
            
          
          
            Methods
            Through bioactivity-guided isolation and comprehensive phytochemical analyses, the cytotoxic effects of different concentrations (ranging from 3.91 to 500 µg/mL) of ginger petroleum ether extract and its fractions were examined against MCF-7, SW 480, and A549 cancer cell lines, as well as 3T3 normal cells using the MTT assay. Fractions were obtained using column chromatography, and those showing significant toxicity were further fractionated using a bioactivity-guided separation method. The most cytotoxic component was purified using plate chromatography, and its toxicity was evaluated. Additionally, molecular docking was performed on gamma-secretase, PPARγ, MMP-9, tubulin, proteins Notch1, HES1, and cyclin D1.
          
          
            Results
            
              Fractions showed toxicity against all the tested cell lines, with a greater effect on MCF-7. A subfraction, FsA7, exhibited an impressive IC
              50
              value of 1.68 ± 0.36 µg/mL against MCF-7. It also showed selective toxicity towards cancer cells compared to 3T3 cells. Upon analysis using GC/MS, it was identified as 6-shogaol based on the retention index (RI) and library search programs. Molecular docking studies indicated that 6-shogaol interacts with critical cancer-related targets, especially MMP-9, shedding light on its mechanism of action.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 6-shogaol as a complementary treatment in breast cancer. This research provides foundational insights into the use of ginger-derived compounds in enhancing current cancer treatment strategies. Pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of cytotoxic effects of 6-shogaol in combination with anti-cancer drugs can be considered for future studies.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of vocational education informatization, how to accurately evaluate curriculum quality and learning effect has become an important topic in the field of education. This paper proposes an intelligent evaluation model based on the combination of Diffusion reinforcement learning and multi-scale residual network, aiming at improving the evaluation accuracy and intelligence level of vocational education courses. The model is designed to scale efficiently for large datasets and diverse educational platforms, ensuring its applicability across different regions with varying curricula and student engagement. By designing a comprehensive model, this model can monitor the learning process in real time, analyze students’ learning behaviors, and ensure the security of data based on network security requirements. Based on the Diffusion reinforcement learning method, this paper uses the state, action, and reward mechanism in the reinforcement learning framework to dynamically evaluate the course content. The training process of reinforcement learning obtains real-time feedback through interaction with students, forming an accurate curriculum evaluation model. Experimental data show that the model based on Diffusion reinforcement learning improves the accuracy of course evaluation by about 15%, and the evaluation error of the model is reduced by 20% compared with traditional evaluation methods. Combined with multi-scale residual network, the curriculum data is deeply analyzed, and the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation system are enhanced by multi-level feature extraction. The introduction of MSRN enables the model to extract features at different scales, further improving the depth and accuracy of understanding of course content. The experimental verification shows that the evaluation accuracy of the model after using MSRN is improved by 18%, and it performs well in the adaptability of different course contents, especially in complex data sets. Considering the network security, this paper specially designs the data transmission and storage mode based on encryption technology to ensure the privacy and security of students’ data. By adopting SSL encryption protocol and firewall technology, the system can effectively resist external attacks and ensure the integrity of evaluation data. Experiments show that under the premise of network security, the evaluation results of the model are not affected by malicious attacks, and the stability of the model is improved by 25%. The intelligent evaluation model proposed in this research has significant advantages in improving the accuracy and robustness of vocational education curriculum evaluation, especially in the context of complex data and network security, and shows a good practical application prospect.},

  abstract = {Effective proportional–integral–derivative controller tuning is critical for attaining high-performance operation in direct current motor systems, especially when traditional approaches fail under nonlinear or uncertain dynamics. This study conducted a statistically robust comparative analysis of seven evolutionary algorithms for proportional–integral–derivative gain tuning: genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, firefly algorithm, artificial bee colony, simulated annealing and invasive weed optimisation algorithm. Simulations were performed in MATLAB/Simulink using two different tuning scenarios: Case 1 (conservative bounds) and Case 2 (aggressive bounds), with the integral time absolute error serving as the primary performance metric. Analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's
            d
            were employed to ensure statistical validity. The results revealed distinct trade-offs among the algorithms. Particle swarm optimisation achieved the best overall performance, with a minimal integral time absolute error mean of 190.54 in Case 2, low volatility and a moderate execution time of 1200.19 s. The invasive weed optimisation algorithm was the fastest algorithm, with execution times of 285.76 and 371.43 s in Cases 1 and 2, respectively, but it exhibited higher integral time absolute error variability. Simulated annealing and the firefly algorithm yielded the lowest integral time absolute error means (158.74 and 160.22, respectively) in Case 1, but they required the highest computational time (up to 20,567.84 s for simulated annealing). In contrast, the artificial bee colony performed the worst, with a Case 2 integral time absolute error mean of 422.38 and significant gain inconsistency. Statistical analysis with analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's
            d
            revealed the significance of the differences. This work provides evidence-based guidance for selecting evolutionary algorithms in proportional–integral–derivative tuning based on system priorities. A hybrid invasive weed optimisation algorithm–particle swarm optimisation framework is proposed as a promising future direction, combining the rapid global search of invasive weed optimisation algorithm with the reliable convergence of particle swarm optimisation for real-time, high-precision control.},

  abstract = {Background:
            CT signs of inflammatory and malignant pulmonary nodules are shared and often confused, leading to difficulties in clinical differentiation. Previous relevant studies have neglected to explore the reclassification of morphological signs. This study was designed to evaluate radiomics based on CT images for distinguishing difficult-to-diagnose inflammatory and malignant pulmonary nodules.
          
          
            Methods:
            This retrospective study included 333 patients with malignant pulmonary nodules (Mn) and 161 patients with inflammatory pulmonary nodules (In) who were pathologically diagnosed between January 2017 and February 2024. According to whether the CT signs of pulmonary nodules were typical (typical: A or atypical: B), they were further divided into typical malignant nodules (MnA), atypical malignant nodules (MnB), typical inflammatory nodules (InA) and atypical inflammatory nodules (InB). Group 1 (MnA/InA), group 2 (InA/MnB), group 3 (MnA/InB), and group 4 (MnB/InB) were obtained by pairwise comparison. Clinical models, radiomics models and nomogram models were established for each group. The model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The AUCs of the models were compared by using the DeLong test.
          
          
            Results:
            In the test set, the AUC values ranged from 0.63 to 0.82. In each group, the nomogram model had the highest diagnostic efficiency and had high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. For group 3, the nomogram model had the best diagnostic ability (training set: AUC, 0.83; 95% CI [0.75-0.90]; accuracy, 0.72; sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.84, test set: AUC, 0.82; 95% CI [0.70-0.94]; accuracy, 0.65; sensitivity, 0.96).
          
          
            Conclusions:
            The nomogram model was useful in diagnosing inflammatory and malignant nodules with typical or atypical signs, especially those with malignant signs, yielding a better classification performance than the radiomics and clinical model.},

The book proposes that we can build, based on Bourdieu “trialectic of symbolic, social and physical space,” a distinctive conception of the urban as the site for the accumulation, differentiation and contestation of varied species of capital and for the commingling and collision of variegated habitus. The city then emerges as a breeding ground for fields and an engine of social perplexity. Territorial stigmatization results from the symbolic marking of spoiled space. The jail is a core urban institution that needs to be brought to the forefront of the sociology of the production and regulation of class and ethnic marginality.

To address this, the complex and irregular surface geometry of biofouling was simplified by decomposing it into a series of single-wave models. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) were conducted to simulate turbulent channel flow over wavy walls, generating a comprehensive dataset of frictional resistance components. The frictional force acting on the wavy surface was defined as the effective shear stress, accounting for both viscous shear and pressure-induced forces. The distribution of friction velocity exhibited a strong correlation with the pressure component acting on the surface.

  abstract = {Prefactual thinking, a form of prospective mental simulation, significantly impacts individuals’ decision-making. To understand the influence of media consumption on public opinion regarding emerging technologies, this study, in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI), examined prefactual thinking as a cognitive process of media consumption, extending the cognitive mediation model. Using quota sampling, we conducted an online survey of 1,129 Hong Kong adult residents. The findings revealed that elaborative processing was positively associated with prefactual thinking, which, in turn, influenced emotional responses. Prefactual thinking and emotional responses shaped benefit-risk perceptions, which influenced individuals’ generative AI opinion. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.},

  abstract = {Modeling the complex interrelationships among students, learning resources, and knowledge points remains a significant challenge in intelligent educational systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an improved Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN) framework for comprehensive learning behavior modeling and personalized educational recommendation. We define three distinct node types—students, resources, and knowledge points—and construct a multi-relational heterogeneous graph by incorporating diverse edge types derived from behavioral interactions (e.g., clicks, completions), knowledge dependencies (prerequisite relationships), and content associations (label-based matching). A student–resource–knowledge point meta-path is designed to capture composite relational patterns, and a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) is employed to aggregate neighborhood information while preserving semantic distinctions across relation types. To model temporal learning sequences, a Transformer encoder is integrated to generate dynamic attention weights that reflect evolving student engagement. A gated fusion mechanism is introduced to effectively combine dynamic sequential features with static structural representations, ensuring feature complementarity and minimizing interference. The model further incorporates two jointly optimized output branches—learning status prediction (including dropout risk and performance forecasting) and personalized resource recommendation—through shared parameter learning. Experimental results on real-world educational datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach: the F1-score for dropout risk prediction reaches 0.91, grade prediction achieves a stable RMSE of approximately 0.32, and resource recommendation attains an NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) @10 of 0.93 in standard scenarios and 0.88 in knowledge gap scenarios. Moreover, the coverage of long-tail resources improves to 0.56, with a reduced recommendation bias coefficient of 0.29. The results validate the model’s effectiveness in capturing intricate student–resource–knowledge dynamics, offering a robust solution for learning analytics and adaptive educational systems.},

The Dual Quaternion Linear Blending (DLB) algorithm is employed to enhance the realism of the model’s motion. The improved median-mean filtering algorithm and the improved Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm are utilized to detect and recognize human motion. These techniques are integrated into a martial arts learning assistance system. The results showed that compared with the standard median-mean filtering algorithm, the improved median-mean filtering algorithm had better filtering effect and more sensitive processing nodes in both martial arts motion forms. Its stability rate and real-time rate were 95.53% and 97.05%, respectively, with an improvement of 8.49% and 26.54%, indicating that the improved algorithm has better performance. In comparison to the standard EWMA algorithm, the enhanced EWMA algorithm demonstrated favorable performance in both scenarios involving angle alteration. This resulted in a reduction in computational error and delay, as well as an improvement in both the smoothing rate and real-time rate, with an increase of 53.02% and 70.42%, respectively. In the two-player mode, the CPU resource usage was reduced by 34.5% and the GPU resource usage was increased by 29.5% by updating the vertices and rendering through GPU.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Shenzhen’s economy, there is an urgent need for a large number of urban core industrial parks that meet modern needs. However, many core industrial parks have low utilization rates due to the aging facilities and irrational functional layout. Therefore, to enhance the utilization rate of industrial parks, the study proposes a design quality research method for urban renewal projects of Shenzhen industrial park that integrates building information modeling and virtual reality technology. The study integrates the data in building information modeling into an update project engineering schedule by introducing an improved genetic algorithm, and constructs an evaluation quality index for industrial park update project design to improve the overall design quality. The experimental results revealed that the genetic ant colony algorithm reduced the number of iterations by 36% and 25%, the iteration time by 25.6% and the accuracy by 97.4% compared to the genetic algorithm and the ant colony algorithm. The improved genetic ant colony algorithm optimized the building information modeling data by 16%, and the load indexes decreased by 0.096 and 0.184 relative to the other two algorithms. The project has a quality management score of 88.97, with an overall rating of excellent. As a result, the proposed model is able to generate the updated project schedule and enhance the efficiency of project management, which can help to promote the upgrading of the industrial parks in Shenzhen and the sustainable development of the city.

To enhance preschool teachers’ art teaching abilities, this paper proposes combining virtual reality technology and digital media art. Utilizing computers and modern network technology, users’ information is collected in 12 different teaching environments under the backdrop of digital media virtual technology. The score of the user’s information receiving effect is obtained by the ratio of the number of scenes in the user’s subjective memory to the total number of scenes. SMOTE data enhancement algorithm and Few-shot learning algorithm are used to process the received information to get the user’s receiving effect. The score range of the user’s information receiving effect is 0–1, the larger the number, the better the information receiving effect. The significance of this research lies in its demonstration of how integrating offline laboratory hardware with online virtual reality technology to create an immersive teaching environment can significantly enhance students’ learning interest.

Using a two-step spontaneous geolocation data platform to visualize park path system data. Visualize the path system of the park landscape using digital technology. Introduce five characteristic elements of park landscape space and determine the relationship between the main landscape elements and spatial theory. Analyze the qualitative relationship between these elements and spontaneous geolocation data through linear regression analysis and correlation testing, and conduct simulation experiments. In the simulation experiment, the corresponding selectivity of the flower show area was 0.97 at a distance of 40 m. The path selectivity corresponding to the parent-child area was second only to the flower show area, with a specific value of 0.89. The path selectivity for these three areas of bamboo pavilion, badminton, and basketball was not significantly different, all located around 0.75. As the distance increased, the selectivity value gradually decreased, and the changing magnitude gradually decreased. This research method has significant effectiveness and feasibility in the important design parameters of parks. This can provide certain reference value for landscape architecture design.},

  abstract = {This study aims to develop machine learning (ML)-based homogenization models to efficiently predict the effective elastoplastic properties of short fiber-reinforced composites (SFRCs), reducing the reliance on computationally expensive micromechanical simulations. Sobol sampling is employed to generate training data by varying constitutive and microstructural parameters of representative volume element. Several ML models including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) are trained to predict homogenized stress-strain responses. A new approach is introduced that decomposes the stress-strain response into elastic and plastic components, allowing the ML models to learn these components separately and effectively. Additionally, the Taguchi method (L27 orthogonal array) is employed to minimize simulation runs and evaluate parameter sensitivity through ANOVA. The best-performing ML model is implemented in a finite element analysis (FEA) of an automotive component. Among all models, ANN demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting the macroscopic elastoplastic response across a wide range of input parameters. Finally, the ANN-based elastoplastic material model is validated on a real-world macroscopic structure by implementing it into the finite element analysis of an automotive component. The results demonstrate that ML-based homogenization closely matches the traditional homogenization methods and also highlights its ability to effectively capture nonlinear material behavior.},

Based on the characteristics of tourism text data, an improved clustering algorithm is introduced to classify the data, and a search method based on dynamic themes and search intentions is proposed. The results showed that the algorithm proposed in the study had good convergence and stability. The sum of squared errors curve results indicated that its error results in the three dimensions of traffic, catering, and accommodation were relatively small. The normalized discounted cumulative gain value of tourist attraction information search showed that the algorithm proposed in the study was significantly better than other comparative algorithms. Its maximum value approached 0.80 when the theme dimension was 5, and its accuracy in classifying information under both target search intention and analytical search intention exceeded 80%.

Using tourism economic data from 2009 to 2019, combined with geographic information analysis and an input-output model, we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of Guizhou’s tourism industry and its impact on regional economic growth. The results indicate that after 2016, Guizhou’s total tourism revenue and visitor numbers entered a phase of rapid expansion, with annual growth rates averaging 36.96% and 32.15%, respectively. Spatial analysis reveals that tourism revenue distribution across county-level administrative divisions follows a diffusion pattern, expanding from core cities such as Guiyang and Zunyi to surrounding areas. Furthermore, an analysis of industrial structure indicates that Guizhou’s economy is primarily driven by the secondary and tertiary sectors, with the tourism industry’s backward linkages within the industrial chain strengthening over time, positioning it as a key catalyst for growth in related industries. Model validation results demonstrate that both the influence and sensitivity coefficients of the tourism industry significantly exceed the national economic average, underscoring its substantial stimulative effect on regional economic expansion. Geographic detector analysis further reveals that policy regulation, advancements in information technology, and regional industrial structures play a critical role in the coupled and coordinated development of the tourism economy and the broader regional economy. Based on these findings, this study proposes policy recommendations to optimize Guizhou’s tourism industry structure, enhance tourism service infrastructure, and promote integrated regional development. By integrating spatiotemporal pattern analysis with industrial chain effect evaluation, this study highlights tourism’s core role in regional economic development and quantitatively assesses its contribution from a geographical perspective.},

Although existing channel state information (CSI)-based positioning algorithms have achieved good positioning accuracy, they still face significant challenges in practical applications due to their high computational complexity and cost. To address this, this paper proposes an indoor positioning method based on the frequency fading characteristics of broadband signals, named the ACCS algorithm. This method introduces the innovative use of the autocorrelation spectrum of broadband signals to transform the indoor positioning problem into an image classification task. After that, to achieve lightweight model design, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which is an unsupervised learning model based on convolutional neural networks, is employed to reduce the dimension and compress the input images. Finally, a deep residual network combined with a CS-Attention module, which is composed of a channel feature extraction module and a spatial feature extraction module, is used to efficiently capture image features for more accurate position estimation. The performance of the proposed method was tested using data collected in a conference room. Experimental results show that the autocorrelation processing and attention module in the proposed algorithm significantly improve positioning accuracy, achieving a positioning error of 0.245 m in complex indoor environments. Additionally, comparisons with common positioning algorithms (AOA, W-KNN) demonstrate that our method exhibits significant advantages in positioning accuracy and robustness.},

In response, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)—a US-based network of social scientists, technologists, and activists—was formed to develop an environmental data justice framework to address the ongoing political forces that influence how environmental data is collected, shared, and rendered flawed, incomplete, or vulnerable. By collaborating with communities and non-profit organizations, EDGI's Environmental Enforcement Watch (EEW) project designed computational notebooks that critically situate, question, and analyze EPA datasets on industry compliance and state enforcement of environmental regulations beyond the Trump political moment. These civic partnerships expose gaps, biases, and silences in environmental data that sustain a harmful permission-to-pollute system. Using a multi-sited auto-technography, we reflect on the development and use of EEW notebooks, tracing their application across workshops, collectively designed reports, and data stewardship practices. We show how feminist care practices informed the creation of computational notebooks as an effective resource for environmental justice groups to negotiate environmental datafication, supporting the co-production of critical knowledge about environmental governance.},

Under these extreme conditions, the synergistic effects of elevated temperature and aggressive media exacerbate multi-mechanism corrosion in oil and gas pipelines, posing high failure risks for conventional steel protection strategies. Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts form protective films primarily through coordination bonding and electrostatic adsorption, with structural optimization significantly enhancing their performance. Composite inhibitor formulations demonstrate superior efficacy in field applications. However, current studies exhibit critical gaps, including validated failure models under multi-field coupling conditions and high-temperature adsorption kinetics data. Future research should prioritize molecular design optimization, enhanced environmental compatibility, and advanced multi-scale simulations. Integrating in-situ characterization techniques with machine learning approaches will enable mechanism-driven, precision design of high-temperature corrosion inhibitors, thereby offering robust theoretical frameworks and practical engineering solutions for long-term corrosion mitigation in extreme environments.},

  abstract = {Based on the background of the concrete face crack repair project for the Garden Aqueduct in Anhui Province of China, mechanical tests were conducted to explore the effects of different amounts of styrene-acrylic mortar, water-cement ratio, curing humidity, and curing temperature on the mechanical properties and crack resistance of the concrete face. The test results show that increasing the styrene-acrylic mortar content and reducing the water-cement ratio can significantly improve the crack resistance of the styrene-acrylic mortar, manifested as an increase in flexural strength, a decrease in the compressive-flexural ratio, and an improvement in toughness and bonding strength. However, there was no significant improvement in compressive strength. It was confirmed that the styrene-acrylic mortar with 15% styrene-acrylic mortar content and a water-cement ratio of 30% exhibited optimal mechanical and crack resistance properties and is suitable for repairing cracks in the concrete face of the aqueduct. Additionally, higher curing humidity and temperature significantly improved the dry cracking resistance of the styrene-acrylic mortar. Under various curing conditions, the shrinkage rate of the styrene-acrylic mortar increased rapidly within the first 14 days and stabilized by day 28. Based on the test results, construction process optimization measures for the crack repair of the aqueduct concrete face were proposed, along with directions for future research.},

  abstract = {This study fabricated ancient brick column specimens with two different mortar joint spalling depths based on the common material deterioration mode of ancient masonry. Specifically, modified composite sticky rice-lime mortar and natural hemp fiber rope were used as the raw materials, and horizontal mortar joint grouting and fiber rope reinforcement methods were adopted to prepare performance-enhanced ancient brick column specimens with six different strengthening conditions. Through uniaxial compression tests, the compression failure morphology and mechanical properties of the specimens under different strengthening conditions were studied, and the variation patterns of mechanical performance indicators with the strengthening conditions were analyzed. The calculation formula for the compressive strength of performance-enhanced ancient masonry was proposed, and the full stress-strain relationship model under compression and the crack length development model were established. The results show that the non-strengthened brick columns exhibit brittle failure morphology under compression, and the compressive strength and deformation modulus decrease with the increasing mortar joint spalling depth. The crack development process of reinforced brick columns under compression presents ductile characteristics. The compressive strength and crack density increase with an increasing grouting depth and mortar joint grouting-fiber rope reinforcement significantly enhances the elastoplastic deformation capacity of brick columns under compression. Under the 25% grouting depth ratio, the characteristic stress and corresponding deformation modulus of the stress-strain curve increase first and then decrease with the increasing fiber rope reinforcement ratio. The compressive strength and crack density of ancient brick column with the 12.5% grouting depth ratio and 0.25% reinforcement ratio increase by 57.1%, 24.7%, respectively. The established formula and models can clearly describe the evolution of mechanical properties of ancient masonry, offering good engineering applicability.},

Additionally, an in-depth study is conducted on the impact of vehicle driving conditions on the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system. Research results indicate that as the drop position offset increases, the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system gradually decreases. Specifically, when the coolant flow rate is 10 mL/min and the offset reaches 9 mm, the maximum temperature difference of the battery module increases to 3.7°C. Meanwhile, as the slope increases, the heat dissipation performance of the cooling system gradually decreases. When the slope reaches 20% and the coolant flow rate is 20 mL/min, the maximum temperature difference of the battery module is 4.8°C.},

  abstract = {As one of the world’s three major ecosystems, wetlands play an important role in maintaining ecological balance. However, in recent years, wetland resources have suffered from encroachment and frequent water environment and soil pollution problems, causing serious damage to China’s wetland ecosystem. The study proposes to conduct a performance audit (PA) of the wetland park project (WPP) using financial and accounting tools to assess the effectiveness of wetland restoration. The study first constructed a PA evaluation index system for WPP using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model to ensure the comprehensiveness of the evaluation indexes. Subsequently, grey relational analysis combined with analytic hierarchy process (GREY-AHP) was introduced to convert the scores into mutual inverse judgment matrices and assign weights to the indicators to improve the accuracy and scientificity of the construction system. Finally, the PA evaluation results are derived through comprehensive evaluation. The innovation of the study is to apply the PSR model to WPP’s PA, which significantly improves the accuracy and comprehensive performance of the evaluation compared with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the maximum F1 values of the research-proposed model on the test set and validation set are 95.2 and 97.6, respectively, which are higher than those of other algorithms, showing the advantage in comprehensive evaluation performance. The results of the study are of great significance for improving the performance level of WPP and effectively protecting and restoring wetlands.},

In terms of background, as a cultural heritage, the unique landscape of traditional villages attracts many tourists, but the existing recommendation system often lacks personalization and accuracy. Firstly, the YOLO model is used to quickly and accurately identify traditional village images and extract key landscape features. Then, combined with the powerful sequence processing capabilities of the Transformer model, the user behavior data is deeply mined to build a personalized recommendation algorithm. Experimental results show that image recognition accuracy of the proposed system reaches 95.6%, which is 8.2% higher than that of the traditional method. Regarding recommendation satisfaction, user satisfaction was as high as 90.3%, which was significantly higher than 78.5% of control group.

  abstract = {In the rapid development of higher education management, informatization has become an indispensable driving force. With the popularity of the campus card and the accumulation of various business system data, the campus big data environment has initially taken shape. However, there are many shortcomings in the current student information management platform, especially in the accuracy of data mining. To meet this challenge, we use a decision tree, naive Bayes algorithm, and regression analysis to construct a comprehensive analysis model. On this basis, we use Hadoop technology to build a set of behavior analysis and intelligent management system frameworks for higher vocational college students. The system can comprehensively collect and organize students’ study, life and consumption data, and accurately present the overall situation of students on campus. Through in-depth correlation analysis, we can reveal the inner relationship between students’ learning results, life patterns, and psychological changes. To verify the effectiveness of the system, we conducted extensive testing. In the comparison of prediction accuracy of combination algorithms, we used the average relative error as an evaluation index to analyze and predict the behavior of vocational college students. The test data covers a sample of students ranging from 1000 to 6000. The results show that compared with traditional single algorithms, the student behavior prediction model proposed in this study based on multiple algorithm combinations exhibits higher prediction accuracy, with an average relative error of less than 5%. This result indicates that the hybrid algorithm model we constructed has superior predictive performance.},

  abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of intelligent applications in edge computing, the efficient scheduling and lightweight deployment of deep learning models have emerged as critical challenges. This study presents a unified framework that integrates adaptive deep neural network compression with priority-aware task scheduling, specifically tailored for edge computing environments. A hierarchical joint compression strategy is proposed, combining sparsity and quantization through learnable parameters to achieve substantial model size reduction while preserving predictive accuracy. Concurrently, a two-stage load redistribution scheduling algorithm is developed, guided by task latency tolerance and completion time deviation, to enhance resource utilization and achieve balanced server load distribution. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark deep learning models and real-world power IoT scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method attains a 143× compression ratio with only a 1.3% loss in accuracy. Furthermore, it improves task latency and load balancing efficiency by over 18% and 21%, respectively, when compared to conventional methods. These results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating lightweight, responsive, and resource-efficient edge intelligence.},

  abstract = {As the representative of high-density energy and clean energy, nuclear power has prominent advantages. Using nuclear power to generate electricity can not only alleviate the problem of energy tension, but also solve the problem of pollution faced by other energy sources. Therefore, nuclear power has become one of the major energy sources vigorously developed by countries around the world. With the development of the nuclear power industry, the nuclear industry has begun to research and develop various types of new reactors with a view to the future in order to further improve the safety and economy of nuclear power. In recent years, small modular reactors have gained wide attention due to their low initial cost, short construction period, flexible power plant layout, and wide use. At the same time, the small modular reactor of nuclear power plant also has great disadvantages, that is, the effectiveness of the safety system of the small modular reactor of nuclear power plant is difficult to be guaranteed under complex conditions, especially in the problem elimination after the accident, which has been the focus and difficulty of nuclear energy research in all countries. Therefore, taking the Westinghouse small modular reactor designed by Westinghouse as an example, this paper studies the actual elimination effects and measures for serious accidents of small modular reactors in nuclear power plants, and then verifies the safety of small modular reactors. After research, after a serious accident occurred in a small modular reactor, timely elimination of the residual heat of the small modular reactor is the key and difficult work to eliminate the small modular reactor; the passive core makeup tank designed in the small modular reactor has a rapid and excellent mitigation effect after a serious accident.},

Through the design and distribution of 800 questionnaires, 706 valid data were recovered and analyzed. Statistical methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman grade correlation coefficient and regression analysis were adopted to deeply analyze the relationship between students’ use frequency of digital narrative tools, self-assessment of foreign language digital narrative ability and learning motivation. The results show that the use frequency of interactive learning tools and collaborative platforms has a significant positive correlation with students’ speaking and writing ability. Students’ learning motivation also showed a positive correlation with their frequency of using digital tools and their foreign language learning effectiveness. Based on these findings, this study suggests that educators should more widely integrate digital narrative tools into foreign language teaching in non-common languages, and design teaching strategies that stimulate students’ intrinsic learning motivation. This study not only provides empirical research support for the foreign language education of non-common language students but also puts forward useful strategies and suggestions on how to effectively use digital tools to promote students’ foreign language learning.

  abstract = {Table tennis is a highly technical and fast sport, which requires athletes to have good technical level and physical fitness. In order to achieve more efficient and intelligent table tennis assisted training, a knowledge-based general sports-assisted training framework (KGSTF) was introduced, and the functions of each module were analyzed. At the same time, an adaptive contact judgment threshold generation algorithm was proposed for the implementation of this framework in specific table tennis training. On this basis, a pose correction method based on contact position constraints and an optical motion capture data preprocessing method were designed, and an automated program was developed to handle data stitching, clutter removal, and labeling. The results showed that in the validation experiment based on the adaptive contact judgment threshold generation algorithm, by incorporating the optimization results of the previous frame into the objective function, the optimized actions can be made smoother. Meanwhile, the landing error of the advanced subjects was only 1.539 cm when receiving a slight topspin serve, 0.947 cm when receiving a downspin serve, and 5.294 cm when receiving a strong topspin serve, which illustrates that a smaller serve speed has more stability. In addition, the return success rate of advanced subjects in the slight topspin mode was the best, with a maximum value of 95.12% and an average of 91.38%. The average return success rate of intermediate subjects in the slight topspin mode was as high as 75.36%. Compared with the strong topspin and downspin service modes, the return success rate was increased by 13.72% and 26.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, the return success rate of advanced subjects was significantly higher than that of other subjects. The results show that the sports auxiliary framework designed by this study can be effectively applied to the sports evaluation of table tennis auxiliary training, which is helpful to provide personalized training guidance and improvement suggestions for table tennis players, and promotes the scientific and professional development of table tennis.},

These enhancements collectively improve the global search capability and convergence precision of the original WOA. The selected color indices from RGB, HSI, and L*a*b* (CIELAB) spaces, filtered via entropy weighting and stepwise regression, were used as inputs to a support vector regression (SVR) model optimized by the IMWOA.

  abstract = {Aiming at services such as nearby consumption and flexible interaction of new loads, it is necessary to achieve higher precision clock synchronization of local equipment, and the public network transmission delay fluctuates randomly, which cannot meet the corresponding accuracy requirements. In order to get rid of the limitations brought by public network transmission, distributed clock synchronization replaces the centralized timing of the master station through information exchange between nodes to achieve higher precision clock synchronization. However, in the process of distributed synchronization, a large amount of information will be exchanged between key nodes of the link and their neighbors, but the concurrent transmission capacity of key nodes such as dedicated power gateways and centralized coordinators (CCOs) is limited, which is difficult to meet the corresponding communication requirements. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a time-triggered distributed synchronization scheme based on node priority, which can meet the requirements of high-precision synchronization and reduce the transmission burden of link aggregation nodes such as power dedicated gateways and CCOs.},

  abstract = {At present, various new technologies are applied to the reform of college English courses. Cases are also increasing. Big data technology has become the focus of most industries in the era of social media with data explosion. Its powerful data analysis and prediction capabilities provide convenience for its application. Applying big data technology to the difficulties encountered in curriculum reform will be able to efficiently and accurately solve related problems. The rapid coverage of IoT applications such as the Internet of Vehicles, smart homes, and smart cities has provided precedents for the use of IoT technology in various industries. With the rapid development of the needs of the Metaverse, it has become a trend to apply IoT technology to social and educational fields. Internet of Things technology can use various miniature portable devices to link into a body area network. The network can record the status of students when they learn English, which supports the subsequent analysis of students’ learning needs and learning effects. The analysis results can also provide more convenience for college English teachers to prepare lessons and teach. In order to investigate the current predicament of college English curriculum reform, this paper distributed 900 questionnaires to managers, teachers, and students in 20 colleges and universities, mainly through the questionnaire star online platform and offline campus distribution. Using classification and statistical algorithms to process and analyze the data, it is found that the problems existing in the current college English curriculum reform include the poor English ability of students, the heavy teaching burden of English teachers, and the lack of an effective comprehensive processing platform for English teaching information. Then, combined with big data and Internet of Things technology, we designed solutions for teachers and students’ dilemma in curriculum reform from the perspectives of platform establishment, intelligent interconnection, and data analysis.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the problem of Chinese pronunciation errors made by native Uyghur speakers by proposing a phoneme confusion modeling framework that integrates cross-linguistic phonological comparison and data-driven methods. Based on speech transfer theory, a corpus of 52,510 standard and non-standard pronunciations (total duration 167.2 hours) was constructed. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm was employed to align phoneme sequences, and Apriori association rule mining was used to uncover high-frequency confusion patterns. The study found that differences in sound, like the lack of retroflex consonants and the simplification of compound vowels, caused systematic errors. For example, the high-frequency substitution of affricates “ch→q” (62.5%) and compound vowels “uo→o/u” (76.1%). Data-driven methods further validated the phonological hypotheses and identified context-dependent phenomena (such as “ian→an” medial weakening). The confusion rule base achieved a robustness of F1-score 0.87. The quantitative model based on the confusion matrix can be integrated into intelligent speech assessment systems to provide real-time corrective feedback (e.g., “‘uo’ detected as misread as ‘o’, probability 76.1%”). This study provides an interpretable rule base and dynamic alignment technical foundation for cross-language pronunciation error correction algorithms, which has theoretical and practical significance for optimizing computer-assisted language teaching systems.},

Currently, more development opportunities have been provided for the traditional human resource management system. However, the traditional human resource management has the problem of information capture and analysis classification, so this research builds a neural network algorithm model under the SSH framework. The model uses the improved long short-term memory neural network to process and classify the information of human resource management, and realizes the processing of human resource management information. The minimum root-mean-square error of the newly constructed algorithm model is 0.18, which is 0.15 smaller than that of the convolutional neural network and 0.06 smaller than that of the genetic neural network. The fitness of the new model is 6.2% higher than that of the convolutional neural network and 2.8% higher than that of the genetic algorithm. The whole model is superior to the traditional neural network algorithm in fit and accuracy, which can solve the problem of human resource management information processing under SSH framework.

However, few studies have explored the mechanism of college students’ learning engagement in blended learning from the perspective of fostering positive academic emotions. Based on a questionnaire survey of 375 college students in a blended learning environment, the data were analyzed and processed using SPSS24.0 and AMOS27.0 software. Structural equation modeling was established to explore the mediating effect of academic self-efficacy in moderating the relationship between academic engagement and positive academic mood. The findings suggest that: (1) in the blended learning environment, college students demonstrate more favorable academic performance and moderate learning engagement. (2) There is a significant positive correlation between active hyperarousal and active hypo-arousal with learning engagement. (3) Positive hyperarousal and positive hypo-arousal not only directly enhance learning engagement but also indirectly promote academic self-efficacy. In teaching practice, under a blended learning environment, educators should further improve the quality of students’ blended learning input. They need to help students foster positive academic emotions of enjoyment and pride and promote their self-efficacy at the same time. Furthermore, they should explore various teaching methods to improve students’ enthusiasm for learning and concentration.},

Through detailed data analysis, we found that the construction of smart campuses has achieved remarkable results in improving management efficiency. In comparison to the traditional student management model, smart campus leverages advanced data analysis technology to achieve precise tracking and evaluation of student behavior, learning status, and other pertinent information. This technological advancement has led to a noteworthy enhancement in management efficiency, with an approximate 30% increase. Furthermore, smart campus facilitates student management departments in promptly identifying and resolving issues faced by students through in-depth data analysis, ultimately leading to a significant improvement in student satisfaction. In terms of educational innovation, smart campus uses big data analysis to accurately locate students’ learning needs and points of interest, providing strong support for personalized teaching. According to statistics, in classes that adopt the smart campus teaching model, the average score of students has increased by 15%, and the degree of learning participation has also increased significantly. In addition, this study also focuses on data security and privacy protection issues in the construction of smart campuses, and proposes corresponding solutions. The construction and application of smart campuses that integrate student management and educational innovation not only improves management efficiency, but also promotes the innovation and development of education and teaching. In the future, we will continue to deepen research and promote the continuous optimization and upgrading of smart campus construction.

However, the rapid development of high-speed Internet and the race to organize the development of quantum computers are a great threat to the existing authentication schemes. Therefore, traditional authentication protocols are vulnerable to attacks in the era of quantum computing. In this paper, I propose an extended chaotic mapping-based authentication and quantum key distribution scheme to defend against quantum attacks and prevent known traditional security attacks. The proposed extended chaotic mapping-based authentication protocol is secure under the real or random (ROR) model. Also, experimental results demonstrate that our protocol is lightweight compared to existing authentication protocols, as listed in the performance analysis section.

  abstract = {In modern digital grid systems, ensuring the stability of power operations and the accuracy of energy metering is critically dependent on effective asset identification, reconfiguration, and automated maintenance strategies. Conventional grid monitoring mechanisms like manual inspections and fixed-sensor networks also experience many difficulties, such as high costs in operation, scalability problems, and inability to present real-time, all-around information. To address these challenges, this research introduces an advanced methodology that leverages deep learning models for asset identification and automation in digital grid systems. Specifically, the research utilizes Roach Infestation Optimized Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (RI-Att-BiLSTM) networks for intelligent asset identification and topology recognition in low-voltage distribution network substations. Time-series data is collected from smart meters and sensors distributed across the low-voltage distribution network. These sensors continuously capture data on electricity consumption from substations and connected consumers. The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, outliers, and gaps, followed by normalization to scale the data for effective modeling. The RI-Att-BiLSTM-based technique reduces the dimensionality of the electricity consumption data matrix, transforming the complex topology identification task into a solvable convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, the proposed model achieve a superior balance between accuracy (98.43%) and higher recall, precision, and F1-score. The enhanced grid resilience provided by this methodology facilitates precise asset identification, real-time monitoring, and fault-tolerant operations, thereby contributing to more efficient and reliable digital grid systems.},

The attributes of each entity in the converter valve can be corresponding to the CIM model. This article preprocessed the collected converter valve data to ensure the quality and availability of the data.

The model predicts Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene (KRAS) gene mutations in CT images using the Reinforced Local Perception Module (RLPM) and incorporates an Attention-based lightweight multi-head mechanism transformer (ATLM). Experimental results indicate that the Local-Global Attention Network (LGA-Net) model achieves accuracy rates of 89.56% and 88.29% for EGFR and KRAS mutation predictions, respectively. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of each module. Our experiments show that the model significantly enhances prediction performance and presents a promising approach for the non-invasive detection of gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Dopamine (DA), a catecholamine neurotransmitter, acts through five G protein-coupled receptors categorized into D1-like (D1, D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, D4) subfamilies. Emerging evidence suggests dopamine receptors influence pancreatic islet function and glucose homeostasis, yet the specific role of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated D2R’s impact on T1DM progression and its underlying signaling mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. MIN6 pancreatic beta cells were treated with D2R agonist quinpirole (50 μM), antagonist haloperidol (10 μM), or their combination, followed by 24-h streptozotocin (STZ) exposure. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assays, apoptosis was evaluated through TUNEL staining and caspase-3/9 expression analysis, insulin secretion was measured by ELISA, and AKT pathway activation was examined via Western blot. Additionally, DRD2 knockout (DRD2-/-) mice were subjected to STZ-induced T1DM to validate in vitro findings. Results demonstrated that quinpirole significantly reduced MIN6 cell viability, enhanced apoptosis markers (cleaved caspase-3/9), decreased insulin secretion, and suppressed phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression in STZ-treated cells. These detrimental effects were partially mitigated by haloperidol co-treatment. Importantly, DRD2-/-mice showed significantly higher insulin levels in both peripheral blood and pancreatic tissue compared to wild-type T1DM mice, suggesting D2R deficiency confers protection against STZ-induced beta-cell dysfunction. These findings collectively indicate that D2R activation negatively regulates pancreatic beta-cell survival and insulin secretion through AKT pathway suppression, positioning D2R as a potential therapeutic target for T1DM intervention.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, the traditional way of art display is facing the severe test of not being able to effectively meet the growing demand of diversified, three-dimensional and immersive experience of the modern audience due to its inherent two-dimensionality and planar limitations in today’s society. As a subversive solution, holographic projection technology, by virtue of its ability to reconstruct three-dimensional images and its unique interactive characteristics, has broken the boundaries of the original artistic expression and greatly enhanced the presentation dimension of the art works and the audience’s depth of participation. In this study, we not only analyze how holographic projection technology can be skillfully combined with big data to realize the highly personalized and dynamic updating of artwork display, but also discuss in detail how it can drive the innovative integration of intelligent layout and immersive experience in the design of public art space. Meanwhile, in the field of ancient relics restoration display, holographic projection technology also shows its great potential in improving restoration accuracy and restoring vivid scenes, which makes historical and cultural heritage vividly presented in front of the audience. Through a series of detailed experiments and practical case studies, we have confirmed that the holographic projection art design has achieved remarkable results and achievements in practical applications, whether in enhancing the visual impact and infectious force of art display, or in optimizing the audience’s viewing experience and interactive participation, all of which have demonstrated their value that cannot be ignored.},

  abstract = {Against the backdrop of digital transformation in education, the integration of Mixed Reality (MR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fostered a new “virtual-physical symbiotic” learning environment. However, current educational tools often fail to capture learners’ dynamic needs and the characteristics of 3D immersive scenarios, resulting in a disconnect between virtual character interactions and the teaching process. Existing approaches face various limitations: rule-based models struggle with the dynamics of three-dimensional spaces; collaborative filtering algorithms overlook spatial contextual features; and deep learning models lack joint modeling of emotion and context. These shortcomings highlight insufficient multi-source data integration and weak situational awareness. To address these challenges, this study proposes a virtual character recommendation method tailored to immersive learning environments. The model is composed of a transformation layer, a self-adversarial data generation layer, an embedding representation layer, and a virtual character prediction layer. It achieves dynamic matching between virtual characters and 3D interactive scenarios by incorporating multi-source data standardization, intelligent agent-based game simulation for scenario data generation, semantic vectorization of character features, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-attention mechanism fusion. This research marks the first application of MR spatial computation and self-adversarial learning in educational role recommendation, offering a technical framework to tackle adaptation challenges in immersive scene recommendations. The proposed approach contributes both theoretical innovations and practical guidance for the advancement of intelligent education.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes can cause fatal damage to concrete bridges. To enhance the seismic resistance of reinforced concrete bridge structures, a finite element model of a continuous reinforced concrete beam bridge is designed using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, and a calculation method for the overall equivalent damping ratio of the bridge is designed based on this bridge type. In the case analysis, the designed calculation method has a smaller relative displacement error at the pier top under seismic loads compared to traditional calculation methods. As the longitudinal reinforcement ratio of the pier column section increases, the bearing capacity of the section significantly increases, while the corresponding ultimate curvature decreases. The greater the yield strength of the longitudinal reinforcement in the pier column section, the greater the bearing capacity of the pier column section, but the displacement ductility coefficient of the section shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. For the reinforcement ratio of the pier column section, increasing the reinforcement ratio does not significantly improve the bearing capacity of the pier column section, but the displacement ductility of the section is significantly improved. The yield strength of the hoop reinforcement is increased from 250 MPa to 550 MPa, and the maximum bending moment of the pier column section and the maximum bending moment in the elastic stage are increased by 3.84% and 1.85%, respectively. It can be seen that this method has a small error under seismic loads and has good application advantages in bridge seismic design. The research content will provide effective technical references for the design of concrete structures for building bridges, as well as seismic construction and maintenance of bridges.},

This framework achieves collaborative optimization of data-driven methods and domain knowledge through the organic integration of deep reinforcement learning and explicit knowledge reasoning, providing a new technological path for intelligent decision-making in complex educational scenarios. In terms of method design, KD-DRL innovatively constructs a dual module knowledge system: the heuristic acceleration knowledge module guides agents to explore efficiently in the early stages of training through intelligent intervention mechanisms, significantly reducing model convergence time; The evasive security knowledge module is based on formal rules to monitor the decision-making process in real time, effectively preventing potential risks. This hierarchical knowledge architecture not only retains the ability of deep reinforcement learning to handle high-dimensional state spaces, but also ensures the reliability and security of decisions through interpretable rule constraints. Experimental verification shows that in the multimodal data environment of real industry academia platforms, KD-DRL exhibits significant advantages: in terms of training efficiency, the model convergence speed is improved by more than 40% compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning methods; In terms of safety, the incidence of teaching accidents has been reduced to below 0.3%, while maintaining a reasonable intervention frequency; In terms of interpretability, the decision-making process supports rule tracing, and the average time for experts to verify a single decision logic is controlled within 5 s.},

Based on this, this study constructed a personalized recommendation system that integrates the GloVe model to capture words' distributed representation, effectively improving resource recommendations' accuracy and relevance. The recommendation system preprocesses large-scale English learning resources and generates personalized resource recommendation lists based on learners' historical learning behaviors and preferences. During the experiment, a three-month test was conducted on 100 learners with different levels of English proficiency, and corresponding usage feedback and learning effectiveness data were collected. The experimental results showed that compared to traditional recommendation methods, the recommendation system based on GloVe improved resource matching by 35% and learner satisfaction by 40%. A survey found that 80% of learners reported that recommended resources better met their learning needs, and their learning efficiency increased by an average of 25%. The system also promoted the growth of learners' vocabulary. The experimental group learners increased their vocabulary by an average of 1500 words within 3 months, significantly higher than the 800 words in the control group.

A two-dimensional plane strain model was developed using MIDAS/GTS software, focusing on the response mechanisms of key factors such as horizontal spacing, soil layer parameters, and building height on building deformation. The research reveals that the horizontal spacing between the tunnel and the building significantly affects the settlement distribution characteristics. When the spacing is 15 m, the settlement difference between the head and tail of the building reaches 1.94 mm, and the established displacement prediction formula effectively characterizes the nonlinear relationship between horizontal distance and displacement. The elastic modulus of the soil plays a decisive role in deformation, with the maximum settlement in silty clay formation (E is 20 MPa) increasing by 572% compared to sandy mudstone formation (E is 60 MPa), reaching 15.9 mm. Increasing building height exacerbates settlement differences, with the settlement difference of a 30 m high-rise building (2.29 mm) increasing by 487% compared to a 12 m low-rise building (0.39 mm). The study proposes 35 m as the horizontal safety spacing threshold and recommends the Cross Diaphragm (CRD) method or the large pipe roof method for highly compressible formations to control the formation loss rate (&lt;0.5%).

Despite significant advancements in the application of ML and artificial intelligence (AI) in automated scoring systems, existing systems still face challenges in assessing the logic, coherence, and creativity of essay content, as well as in accurately identifying off-topic instances. This study aims to address these challenges through two main components: Firstly, an intelligent off-topic assessment mechanism for English essays is developed, utilizing text analysis techniques to accurately identify instances of deviation from the topic. Secondly, an automated scoring and feedback system for English essays based on a composite method is implemented, integrating various ML algorithms and NLP technologies to comprehensively assess the content, structure, and language usage of essays, providing practical writing improvement suggestions. Through these methods, not only is the accuracy of scoring and the effectiveness of feedback enhanced but the modernization process of English teaching and assessment is also advanced. This study aims to address the shortcomings of traditional automated scoring systems in assessing the logic and coherence of English essays, particularly in identifying off-topic responses and ensuring fairness and accuracy in scoring. By developing an intelligent assessment system that integrates multiple machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, significant improvements have been achieved in the performance of automated scoring systems. These enhancements not only enhance the accuracy and consistency of scoring but also provide more specific and practical writing improvement suggestions for educational practices, thereby helping students enhance their writing skills.},

  abstract = {With the introduction of the deep learning large model TabTransformer for electric load analysis and forecasting, this study aims to compare the performance of traditional machine learning, deep learning, and Transformer-based sequential prediction algorithms on heterogeneous tabular data. We propose an interpretable deep learning large model architecture, Electric Power Load TabTransformer (EPLTT), tailored specifically to electric load forecasting with mixed heterogeneous tabular data. EPLTT leverages a Transformer architecture designed explicitly for tabular data processing, akin to GPT-series deep neural networks, efficiently handling complex structured data and providing an effective alternative to conventional models. First, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms addressing tabular learning problems. Subsequently, we demonstrate the configuration and training of EPLTT on real-world forecasting datasets. Finally, we achieve interpretability by applying class-weight adjustments to compensate for dataset imbalance during training. Experimental results indicate EPLTT’s superior performance over traditional models such as LightGBM regarding accuracy, precision, and specificity. Additionally, EPLTT exhibits enhanced adaptability and robustness in dataset preparation and complexity management, fulfilling practical application requirements for speed, generalization, and interpretability. The model’s vertical-domain competitiveness is validated against real-world power load forecasting scenarios, addressing class imbalance, missing values, and categorical data.},

Acoustic emission tests, scanning electron microscopy tests, and axial compression tests were used in the experiments. The mechanical properties of GBC were examined by stress-strain curves, and the variation of parameters concerning content and hydrogel ratio was assessed in relation to the microstructure. Ultimately, based on the acoustic emission (AE) energy of the GBC damage process, combined with the crack compression effect, a GBC load damage model was established.

However, traditional English learning methods are often inefficient and difficult to meet the needs of modern learners. Therefore, this study aims to design and apply an efficient English learning system based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm. The Jaro-Winkler algorithm is a string similarity calculation method which can effectively measure the similarity between words so as to assist learners in memorizing and mastering English vocabulary more effectively. Firstly, this study analyzes the pain points in current English learning, such as insufficient vocabulary and poor grammar mastery, and proposes corresponding solutions. By introducing the Jaro-Winkler algorithm, the system can intelligently recommend words with high similarity for learning and improve learning efficiency. The experimental results show that learners who use this system have an average increase of 30% in vocabulary and a 20% decrease in grammatical error rate within 3 months. In addition, the system also provides a personalized learning path and real-time feedback mechanism, further enhancing learners’ learning motivation and effect.

  abstract = {Given the importance of mental health to the quality of human life and social development, as well as its central position in education in the new era, this paper focuses on the critical group of college students, aiming to optimize the teaching mode of online mental health education through technological innovation, to improve their psychological quality and coping ability. Given the significant changes in college students’ lifestyles, learning modes and communication styles in the Internet era, this paper profoundly analyses these changes’ positive and negative impacts on mental health. In particular, it is pointed out that the incidence of mental health problems among Chinese college students has risen to more than 20%, with depression, anxiety, Internet addiction, and emotional problems being particularly prominent, which seriously constrain students’ academic achievements and quality of life, and may even induce undesirable behaviors. In order to effectively deal with this situation, this paper identifies several key factors affecting the effectiveness of learning based on an in-depth analysis of students’ online psychological learning behaviors. It proposes an optimized collaborative filtering algorithm accordingly. In order to overcome the performance bottleneck and sparsity problems that traditional collaborative filtering algorithms may encounter when dealing with large-scale datasets, we propose an improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on a hybrid strategy, which achieves fine-grained modeling of students’ psychological and behavioral patterns by combining the advantages of SVD++ matrix decomposition, neural network embedding, and content filtering, and through the fusion of multi-source data and feature intersection. The algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy of students’ learning behaviors and achieves an increase of about 30% in the accuracy rate compared with traditional methods. This research result provides a powerful tool for accurately identifying students’ psychological needs and potential problems.

  abstract = {Recycled coarse aggregate exhibits significant heterogeneity in its physical and chemical properties, along with complex interdependencies among various feature attributes. These characteristics often lead to challenges in achieving high accuracy in attribute recognition, highlighting the urgent need for a structured and intelligent analytical framework. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with attribute mathematics theory, aiming to enhance feature representation and improve recognition performance. The method begins by constructing a multi-dimensional attribute graph based on the physicochemical properties of recycled coarse aggregate, capturing the intrinsic correlations among different features. A multilayer GCN is then employed to extract deep-level, globally coupled feature representations. Subsequently, attribute mathematics theory is applied to simplify and logically abstract the output features through membership functions and covering operators, enabling effective feature selection and dimensionality reduction. The refined feature set is finally fed into a discriminant classifier to achieve accurate attribute recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion model over traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, random forest, and MLP. The model achieves average recognition accuracies and recall rates of 0.89 and 0.89 across eight material categories, and 0.90 and 0.89 across seven particle size ranges, respectively. Five-fold cross-validation yields an average accuracy between 0.889 and 0.918, with a low standard deviation of 0.012, indicating strong stability and generalization performance. Moreover, the feature simplification strategy achieves an average feature reduction rate of 0.67 while retaining 0.92 of the original information. These results confirm that the proposed GCN–attribute mathematics framework significantly enhances the attribute recognition capability of recycled coarse aggregate, offering a robust and efficient solution for intelligent identification in sustainable construction materials research.},

  abstract = {With the explosive growth of digital resources in libraries, the limitations of traditional recommendation systems have become increasingly prominent. The collaborative filtering algorithm is affected by the sparsity of the user-item matrix and is difficult to capture long-tail requirements. The low efficiency of association rule mining leads to serious homogenization of recommendation results. How to break through technical bottlenecks and achieve precise and diverse resource recommendations has become the key to enhancing user experience and promoting the construction of smart libraries. Therefore, a library resource recommendation model that integrates collaborative filtering and association rules is developed to optimize the accuracy and personalization of library resource recommendations. First, the research introduces user attribute features and clustering algorithms to improve collaborative filtering algorithms. Then, a library resource recommendation model is constructed by integrating association rules. Finally, the model is tested. The test results showed that in terms of recommendation diversity, when the number of neighbors was 50, the research model generated 560 unique recommendation items, which was significantly better than traditional content-based recommendation models. In terms of coverage indicators, the research model stabilized at 42%, which was 17% to 30% higher than comparison methods. In real library scenario testing, the research model could identify and recommend six randomly selected user accounts.

  abstract = {Fabric defect detection (DD) is critical in ensuring high-quality textile production, as defects can significantly impact aesthetic appeal and market value. Manual inspection methods are often inefficient and prone to inconsistency, motivating the development of intelligent, automated systems. Despite advancements in computer vision and deep learning (DL), many current models, such as rule-based methods involving thresholding and edge detection, still face challenges in accurately detecting subtle or complex defects under varied lighting and texture conditions. This research addresses these gaps by proposing a novel, DL-driven model named Binary Gannet Optimizer-driven Gate Adjusted Long Short-Term Memory Network (BGO-GALSTM-Net) for robust and precise defect detection and classification in textiles. A comprehensive dataset, ensuring diversity in defect types such as stains, holes, and misweaves, is used to train and evaluate the proposed model. Data preprocessing involves contrast enhancement and edge-preserving smoothing to improve defect visibility. Feature extraction uses a residual network (ResNet), allowing the model to focus on intricate defect regions. The proposed BGO-GALSTM-Net integrates temporal memory capabilities of LSTM with adaptive gating, while the Binary Gannet Optimizer fine-tunes model parameters for optimal performance. This architecture effectively processes the input image data, learns spatiotemporal patterns, and classifies defect types with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy (97.4%) along with higher F1-score, precision, and recall across various fabric types, outperforming traditional approaches.

  abstract = {In modern Software-Defined Networking (SDN), traffic engineering often faces critical challenges in maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) due to congestion over bottleneck links. Existing traffic engineering (TE) schemes frequently overlook the performance degradation caused by such bottlenecks, resulting in inefficient routing and poor load balancing. To address this issue, we model the traffic allocation problem as a bottleneck game with splittable flows, where users compete for shared bottleneck resources and select routes based on a link pricing strategy. We propose a distributed routing algorithm based on bottleneck game theory (DRB), which introduces a pricing application-driven network routing mechanism between users and the SDN controller. The controller periodically monitors link utilization, updates link prices accordingly, and broadcasts them to users. Each user independently selects the lowest-cost path, implicitly guided by bottleneck usage. This mechanism effectively steers traffic away from congested paths, minimizes queuing delay, and achieves global load balancing, thereby ensuring improved QoS. Extensive simulations on real-world topologies from the SNDlib dataset, including Abilene and GEANT, validate the effectiveness of DRB. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Hedera and ECMP, the proposed DRB algorithm consistently achieves higher throughput, lower latency, reduced jitter, and minimized packet loss under varying traffic demand levels. These results demonstrate that DRB effectively mitigates bottleneck-induced congestion and enhances QoS in SDN-based networks.},

  abstract = {In order to additionally solve the problems of data leakage, tampering, and malicious sharing in the cloud environment, the study proposes a fog computing-based privacy data storage and query mechanism, which employs multilevel data partitioning and hybrid encrypted transmission. Meanwhile, a combined data resource sharing scheme based on virtualized shared datasets is proposed for efficient management of privacy data in enterprise sensing cloud systems. The experimental results show that the accuracy of data retrieval and recovery obtained by the research method is above 98% and are more stable in the case of data size growth. The data retrieval of the shared mechanism consumes less than 2 s, while the non-adaptive cloud storage scheme consumes up to 7 s. The experimental results show that the hybrid encryption mechanism in the scheme has a greater effect on ensuring data privacy and has a high practical value. The improved scheme proposed in the study helps to ensure data privacy, reduce data redundancy and has lower power loss under cloud data storage and query mechanism. Research not only reduces labor and time costs, but also improves the protection of private data. At the same time, it has also made practical and powerful contributions to promoting the interconnection of information systems in various industries and realizing the beautiful vision of informatization and smart life services.},

  abstract = {Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) relies heavily on the aggregation of fuzzy data, yet determining the most appropriate decision remains challenging, especially when information is limited or uncertain. To address this, recent research has introduced Aczel-Alsina (AA) aggregation operators (AOs) for different types of fuzzy sets. This study proposes novel Fermatean fuzzy aggregation operators by incorporating AA t-norm and AA t-conorm, along with the development of AA product and AA sum for Fermatean fuzzy sets. Additionally, we introduce two innovative operators: the Fermatean fuzzy AA weighted averaging and Fermatean fuzzy AA weighted geometric operators. The theoretical properties of these operators, including idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness, are rigorously analyzed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply it to a decision-making problem in the cross-border e-commerce environment, focusing on AI-driven consumer behavior prediction and personalized targeted advertising campaigns. A global retail firm utilizing AI algorithms to analyze large-scale consumer data is examined as a case study. Our method enhances decision-making by aligning marketing strategies with cultural and consumption patterns across different regions, ultimately improving customer engagement and increasing sales. Comparative analysis with existing methodologies demonstrates that our approach outperforms conventional techniques, offering a more accurate and adaptable decision-making framework. This research contributes to the broader understanding of AI-based personalization in business environments. It reinforces its role as a robust decision-support tool for sustainable and socially responsible global market interactions.},

Edge computing has emerged as a new solution. Considering the computing resources of idle devices, the offloading strategy and resource allocation method are jointly optimized to minimize the average delay of task procedure in a communication system with multiple terminals and single edge computing server. The problem can be divided into two subproblems, resource allocation optimization subproblem and task offloading strategy subproblem, which can be solved by Lagrange multiplier method and Nash equilibrium game algorithm, respectively. An enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm is also introduced to generate the initial offloading strategy.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart agriculture has become a new direction in the development of modern agriculture. This study aims to enhance the utilization of agricultural resources and strengthen the intelligent and scientific management of crop growth. Given the low efficiency, high cost, and insufficient monitoring accuracy of the current traditional agricultural monitoring methods, this study analyzes the key technologies in the domestic and international agricultural IoT field based on the current situation of China’s agriculture. A smart agricultural monitoring system is proposed that combines convolutional neural network (CNN), IoT, and blockchain technology. The system addresses issues such as low efficiency, excessive cost, and inadequate monitoring precision present in traditional agricultural information systems. Meanwhile, it adopts a modular design to enhance scalability and employs a multitasking scheduling mechanism similar to an operating system to ensure high stability. This study also proposes a blockchain-based IoT data platform and designs simulated experiments to verify the system’s performance. The dataset used in the study includes photographic materials of corn from germination to maturity across six growth stages, covering an area of approximately 15 square meters, with images captured from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Moreover, it selects images from the corn planting period, encompassing a vast amount of image data across six growth stages, of which about 20% of data is used for the test set. The results show that the recommended model has different recognition rates for corn crops at diverse growth stages, with an overall recognition error rate, weighted averaged, ranging only from 0.18% to 3.53%. In addition, the model can predict factors affecting crop growth with high precision. The blockchain data storage model still demonstrates excellent system performance under high transaction throughput, meeting the performance requirements of IoT systems. This study fills several research gaps in intelligent agricultural management information systems and provides practical guidance and insights for the application effects of “blockchain + deep learning” technology in sustainable rural development.},

  abstract = {In today’s competitive digital landscape, brands constantly require innovative ways to engage consumers and generate memorable experiences. Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a powerful tool for transforming traditional brand interactions into immersive, interactive experiences. However, conventional methods often fail to attain high realism, faultless interaction, and adaptive consumer engagement. To address these challenges, this research addresses an AR-based technology that develops the creation of immersive brand experiences through interactive graphic design elements. The Dynamic Dung Beetle Optimizer-Driven Stacked Convolutional Neural Network (DDB-Stacked CNN) is employed for image recognition and AR product design optimization, enhancing user engagement in branding. To ensure high-quality AR-driven graphic design elements, image datasets, consumer interaction data, and branding elements were gathered from various sources. The collected data was preprocessed using image enhancement techniques to improve clarity, while a Kalman filter was applied to reduce noise. Dynamic Dung Beetle Optimization (DDBO) is a global search capability that enables real-time optimization of AR-driven interactive design elements, allowing brands to deliver personalized and visually compelling experiences. The framework is implemented in Python, and the findings indicate that the proposed model significantly increases user engagement and improves brand recall and accuracy compared to conventional techniques. This research highlights the transformative potential of deep learning (DL)-enhanced AR graphic design in fostering stronger brand connections, setting a new benchmark for immersive and interactive brand experiences in the digital age.},

  abstract = {In the past, the evaluation of teacher’s teaching ability mainly relied on qualitative evaluation methods, often influenced by subjective factors. Nowadays, student evaluation of teaching is an essential means of monitoring teaching quality, as well as a right and obligation of students. To accurately obtain teaching evaluation results, evaluate the teaching ability, and improve teaching quality, clustering analysis of teaching evaluation data is studied. It adopts an improved K-modes clustering and a neural network prediction model based on machine learning to predict the effectiveness of online learning for students. It conducts experiments to verify it. Experimental studies have shown that the absolute error of training results is 54% in the range of 0–1, and 7% in the range of greater than 3. The similarity between the initial cluster centers selected by the random method and the cluster centers of the sample data is unstable, while the cluster centers from minimizing the sum of squared errors are closer to the sample data. The clustering effect of removing abnormal data is more concentrated. The accuracy of the clustering center distance calculation method studied is 0.9816, while other methods are 0.9321 and 0.9287. The calculated cluster center distances are stable, including values of 0.8307, 0.8547, and 0.8325. It showcases that research methods and predictive models can optimize the evaluation of higher education.

Due to the low operational efficiency and high personnel costs associated with traditional credit risk assessment models, this study opted for an artificial intelligence model with support vector machines for risk assessment. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment model and make it more suitable for the financial characteristics of enterprises, a particle swarm algorithm was introduced to optimize the support vector machine model. For the choice of measurement indicators, the experiment extracted nine indicators with a cumulative contribution of 80% or more from 20 original indicators by means of principal component analysis as the experimental indicators. The model test results showed that the model had the greatest overall classification accuracy and recall rate, which were 89.44% and 58.83%, respectively. Meanwhile, the improved support vector machine model had the lowest misclassification rates for the first and second categories, at 24.45% and 16.74%, respectively. This indicates that the model is more likely to detect enterprises that can incur credit risk and can achieve the research objective with high applicability.},

  abstract = {Background
            HIV-PrEP is a key component of HIV combination prevention and has been routinely available through oral formulations (i.e. oral tablets) across sexual health services (SHSs) in the UK since 2020. We used data from a large, online community survey to assess the acceptability and preference of different HIV-PrEP modalities among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and gender-diverse individuals living in the UK.
          
          
            Methods
            Using data collected from the ‘Reducing inequalities in Sexual Health’ (RiiSH) survey, an online community survey of 1106 GBMSM and gender-diverse individuals having sex with men (November/December 2023), we performed a secondary analysis examining HIV-PrEP modality acceptability and preference (e.g. oral, long acting injectable, gel, or patch) (%) by HIV-PrEP history (never, in lookback period of last 3–4 months since survey completion). Where ≥2 modalities were indicated, participants were asked to specify a single preferred modality. Single choice options were assumed to be the preferred HIV-PrEP modality.
          
          
            Results
            Irrespective of HIV-PrEP history, long acting injectables were highly acceptable (&gt;70%) and the preferred modality (58% [222/386] by those never having used HIV-PrEP, 73% [75/103] in those without HIV-PrEP use in the lookback, 74% [314/424] in those with HIV-PrEP use in the lookback).
          
          
            Conclusions
            We found high acceptability of the use of injectables, with general preference over oral tablets. If injectable HIV-PrEP becomes available at SHSs in England, these modalities could have positive impacts on HIV-PrEP delivery, use, and access.},

In order to study the relationship between entrepreneurship, business environment and regional economic development, a regression model was constructed based on the panel data of various provinces in China from 2020 to 2022, and the stepwise regression and ridge regression methods were used for analysis. Stepwise regression selects the explanatory variables that contribute the most to the model by gradually adding or removing variables. Ridge regression introduces regularization terms to solve the multicollinearity problem in the model and improve the stability of parameter estimation. The analysis results show that the coefficient of impact of the business environment on economic development is 0.33. At a confidence level of 1%, the regression coefficients between business environment and entrepreneurial innovation and entrepreneurship are 0.256 and 0.064. It is clear that business environment optimization can significantly promote regional economic development, in which entrepreneurship is the key intermediary. In addition, a quality business environment can reduce business costs, improve market vitality, encourage entrepreneurs to innovate and start businesses, and drive economic growth through efficient allocation of resources and knowledge sharing. Optimizing the business environment and fostering entrepreneurship are effective ways to promote regional economic prosperity.},

One of the most important issues is the design of hydrogen injector systems that can provide the needed amount of fuel into the combustion chamber with rapid mixing with the main chamber gases to achieve a near homogeneous mixture, in order to ensure stable combustion without anomalies such as pre-ignition and knocking. The present study provides an overview of the ongoing FUELCOM4 project with KAUST and Saudi Aramco in an effort to enhance our knowledge of hydrogen injection, mixing, and combustion characteristics by utilizing high-fidelity laser diagnostics and simulations. First, hydrogen jet injection and mixing characteristics are investigated in a high-pressure constant volume chamber experiment with accompanying simulations for validation.

  abstract = {This study focuses on optimizing inference and prediction using the GLM-4 model in multi-agent systems by proposing an innovative approach that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) for dynamic denoising with transfer reinforcement learning (TRL). Traditional methods face challenges in noisy data environments, limited model generalization, and poor adaptability in dynamic settings. Rule-based inference methods struggle with environmental variability, and single reinforcement learning models are constrained by sample efficiency and strategy transfer limitations. This research introduces a GAN-based dynamic denoising mechanism in which the generator simulates noise distributions to create pseudo-noise samples, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and noisy data. The adversarial training iteratively enhances data quality. Experiments show that this approach improves the signal-to-noise ratio by over 20%, significantly reducing the interference of noise in GLM-4 inference. Transfer Reinforcement Learning facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enhancing learning efficiency in multi-agent collaborative tasks. A state-action value function-based transfer strategy is designed, enabling the migration of learned policy parameters and feature representations from source to target tasks, thereby reducing exploration costs. In multi-agent contract management experiments, this method increased convergence speed by 33% while maintaining policy stability.},

  abstract = {At present, major universities are actively carrying out innovation and entrepreneurship education courses to develop the creative potential of college students. In order to analyze the impact of participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education on college students’ creativity, the study took students from a certain province as a research sample, conducted a follow-up survey, and analyzed the current students’ creativity level and participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze the impact of entrepreneurship and innovation education on college students’ creativity. In order to enhance the credibility of the results, the propensity score matching method (PSM) was also used to verify the impact of participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education on students’ creativity. The analysis results show that the current creativity score of college students in my country is 107.6, which is at an average level; students who do not participate in entrepreneurship and innovation education have the lowest creativity score, and students who are rich in imagination and dare to take risks are more willing to actively participate in entrepreneurship and innovation education. OLS regression and PSM results show that participation in entrepreneurship and innovation education will significantly and positively affect the creativity of college students. Among them, active participation and both types of participation have significant effects on college students’ creativity, while passive participation has no significant effect. Therefore, colleges and universities need to carry out entrepreneurship and innovation education in a variety of ways, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of students to participate, and improve the level of students’ creativity. Specific recommendations include developing interactive hands-on courses, motivating students to participate in innovation competitions and entrepreneurial activities, and providing guidance and resource support to promote personalized development.},

To remedy these problems, we conceptualize cultural threat as a zero-sum problem and specify concrete cultural rights that Muslims receive. In two online experiments in Germany, we randomly assigned people to situations where Muslim cultural rights either replace majority rights (zero-sum) or they co-exist (non-zero-sum). The willingness to accommodate Muslims’ cultural rights varies strongly by the logic of cultural threat, especially for respondents with an inclusionary mindset. They are protective of their own cultural practices, but do not perceive all gains in Muslim rights as inherently threatening. Respondents with an exclusionary mindset, however, respond less to variations in cultural threat. In contrast to people with an inclusionary mindset, they also react more negatively to Muslim than non-Muslim demands for change.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of enterprise business scale, the amount of financial data is growing exponentially, and massive data has become the core resource for enterprise development. However, many enterprises have not yet established a comprehensive intelligent data analysis system, resulting in significant challenges in daily data collection and frequent loss of critical financial data, which seriously restricts the further development of enterprises. Although existing research has explored financial data processing, there are still shortcomings in the combination of algorithm efficiency and system practicality. For example, some studies focus too much on theoretical model construction, resulting in low data processing efficiency in practical applications; some systems struggle to meet the accuracy and automation requirements of enterprise analysis when faced with complex and heterogeneous financial data. In the field of intelligent computing, the chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm provides a new approach for financial data classification and automatic analysis and processing due to its global search capability and parallel computing advantages. This article is based on the chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm, and deeply studies and designs an intelligent financial data processing system. By proposing adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and simplified adaptive particle swarm optimization (RAPSO) algorithms, the data processing flow is optimized. The research results show that the system significantly improves the efficiency and automation level of financial data processing. 52% of enterprises believe that the automation level of system data analysis is high, and the RAPSO algorithm significantly shortens the data processing time compared to the APSO algorithm. However, this study only focuses on the preliminary exploration of enterprise financial data processing. In the future, algorithm application scenarios can be further expanded to optimize system functions to meet more complex business needs.},

  abstract = {Nano-powders have revolutionized the beauty and cosmetic industry, introducing groundbreaking innovations in product formulation and skin protection. Cutting-edge cosmetology leverages titania nanopowders to enhance pigmentation and luminosity in various beauty products, including eye shadows, lipsticks, balms, and lotions. These nanoscale particles not only amplify esthetic qualities but also provide advanced functional benefits including improved hydration, durability, facial radiance, and anti-wrinkling characteristics. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles have also shown enhanced tunability in emerging cosmetic applications. The intersection of scientific research and cosmetic technology has led to fascinating developments in nanofluid dynamics. Motivated by the manufacturing fluid dynamics of nano-cosmetics, in the present work we investigate the non-Newtonian magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) titania-magnesium oxide/methanol (wood spirit) cosmetic nanoliquid dynamics from a stretching surface with a power-law velocity. The Casson viscoplastic model is deployed for rheological effects. Convective and radiative heat transfer are included in the transport model as are viscous heating, internal heat source and wall transpiration (suction/injection) effects. A Tiwari-Das volume fraction formulation is adopted for nanofluid properties. The primitive conservation equations with associated boundary conditions are transformed into a nonlinear coupled ordinary differential boundary value problem which is solved computationally with the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg technique. Validation with previous studies ignoring nanoparticles is included. The innovative hybrid nanoflow composition, combining MgO and TiO
            2
            , demonstrates remarkable potential in both cosmetic and industrial applications. When suspended in non-Newtonian cosmetic creams and exposed to sunlight, the hybrid nanoparticles lead to improved heat transfer properties of hybrid nanofluid suspensions. Notably, they can help mitigate skin tanning during exposure to intense solar radiation, by effectively managing thermal radiation and energy transmission to the skin’s surface. Hybrid nanofluids are observed to transfer more energy away from the stretchable surface when internal viscous dissipation and heat generation are present. The optically thin nano-cosmetic fluids simulated using the Rosseland flux model exhibit a decrease in energy transmission rate. Computations also show that as wall suction or injection escalates, skin friction decreases. Overall enhanced thermal management in cosmetic formulations is produced with MgO and TiO

The traditional evaluation methods have some problems, such as low real-time evaluation, poor evaluation effect of single-modal data, and social approval response bias. Social media big data provides a new way to predict college students’ mental health status in real time and accurately. This paper constructs a mental health prediction model based on web text data. BERT language framework is applied to psychological trait prediction, and BERT bidirectional training mode and Transformer coding module are used to mine more complete contextual semantic features and longer distance contextual dependencies, which solves the problem of enhancement vector representation of psychological trait semantic features. At the same time, considering that the difference in the internal structure of the classifier may lead to different classification effects, the fully connected layer of BERT model and the classical random forest algorithm are, respectively, used as two different classifiers in the downstream classification task to compare the model effects. The results show that BERT-B model has the greatest superiority, the prediction accuracy rate reaches 97.25%, the accuracy rate reaches 96.66%, the recall rate reaches 99.61%, the F1 value reaches 98.11%, and the AUC area reaches 99.44%, which can effectively predict the mental health status. The importance of this study is that it not only provides a fast, accurate and cost-effective mental health assessment tool for colleges and universities but also provides strong data support for personalized intervention and precise implementation of mental health services. The successful application of this innovative model marks an important step in the deep integration and value mining of social media big data in the field of mental health research and has great significance in promoting the modernization and scientific education of mental health.},

  abstract = {The quick development of medical technologies has resulted in the opportunities to improve patient care. Particularly, this study focused on senior health consumers. According to that, the present study suggests a novel method for managing healthcare by combining an intelligent decision-making framework with Digital Twin (DT) technologies into a patient-centered Health Management System (HMS) especially for elderly patients. The technology uses seniors’ real-time data to build effective DT of virtual duplicates that continuously monitor and reflects each person’s health profile. With the help of these DT, real-time health management and predictive analytics are made easier, which allows the system to independently recommend individualized lifestyle adjustments and treatments based on ongoing monitoring. The present study utilizes the integrated digital twin concepts. To monitor the individual patient health data in real time, local twin is used, performed based on the condition-based monitoring (CBM) modules, whereas the global twin helps to combine the data across multiple patients and allowing broader analysis. Additionally, the decision-making process is performed with the help of fuzzy inference system (FIS) based on the system’s overall production rate. Finally, the simulation of the study is performed regarding varying health conditions of patients, which improves the healthcare outcomes through decentralized data-driven approaches. A novel prototype of “Health-Pro” was developed by the inspiration of the existing study, and tested with 43 seniors with the age between 60 and 85. 80% of participants agreed that the system supported to improved health awareness and self-management. Participants stated a promising improvement in their attitude towards controlling their health. Key prerequisites for successful implementation were also observed by the study, and these include the importance of privacy controls, adjustable interfaces and social networking factors. Overall, this innovative method of managing health opens the door for more efficient, flexible healthcare options that are sensitive to each patient’s unique demands, thereby improving senior citizens’ quality of life and health results.},

  abstract = {Teacher-related factors significantly impact students’ higher-order thinking. However, the mechanisms of how these factors specifically affect students’ higher-order thinking in urban science classrooms are unclear, especially in the absence of empirical research based on multimodal assessment methodologies. This study explored the pathways of these factors by constructing a structural equation model and implemented a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment in an urban science classroom to collect brain data, exploring the mechanisms of students’ higher-order thinking development. The results indicated that both teacher-student relationships and scaffolding instruction could positively influence students’ higher-order thinking, and teacher-student relationships could promote students’ higher-order thinking through the chained mediating role of teacher guidance and scaffolding instruction, while teacher guidance alone had a significant negative effect on students’ higher-order thinking. Furthermore, students’ higher-order thinking during the science class using the scaffolding strategy was related to the increased interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the teacher and students’ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—a neural basis associated with effective teacher-student interaction. These findings confirm the importance of the teachers’ role during students’ higher-order thinking development and provide evidence from both the structural equation modeling and brain science for the mechanisms behind higher-order thinking development.},

  abstract = {According to the behavior of cascading dynamics of complex network, we propose an R-T real-time adjustment strategy. Different from the rigid strategies to improve the robustness of the network by changing network structure, the new proposed strategy is a timely, executable and low-cost strategy that can flexibly reduce the load when overload occurs on nodes. The mechanism of the strategies is illustrated, and two adjustment schemes, degree-based and weight-based schemes for selecting and adopting protection measures on the overload nodes are proposed. Numerical simulation is conducted in Shanghai Metro Network. The simulation results show that the proposed strategies can effectively improve the robustness of the network, and compare to the HW adjustment scheme, HD adjustment scheme have a better performance in enhancing the robustness of the network. It also reveals that taking the cost into consideration, the coverage ratio of the real-time adjustment strategy on nodes is not the greater the better, there is a relative optimal value both in the case of random attack as well as deliberate attack.},

  abstract = {This study is an attempt to revisit the Sino-Soviet Summit of 1989 with an emphasis on relevant diplomatic activities, leadership views and intelligence assessments. More specifically, it focuses on the challenges and twists in the Sino-Soviet diplomatic course to this achievement. In doing so, the study puts the 1989 summit in the context of regional rivalries and Cold War multilateralism and discusses with examples how Mikhail Gorbachev’s foreign policy doctrine and his visit to China affected these dynamics. The study argues that this climactic event and its aftermath played a significant role in shaping Soviet–Chinese and then Russian–Chinese relations and can be considered the most significant achievement in Gorbachev’s Asian policy in the late 1980s. In this regard, the article concludes that the diplomatic course to the 1989 summit can display the ‘de-ideologisation of interstate relations’ to the benefit of more tangible bilateral issues such as peacebuilding, border security and economy. It also concludes that some aspects of this peacemaking were problematic to the USA and the Asian allies of China and the Soviet Union.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the evaluation and promotion strategy of red cultural social influence based on big data of the Internet of Things. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things and big data technology, its application in the field of cultural communication has increasingly become the focus of research. Red culture, as a unique cultural heritage of China, its dissemination and promotion carry great significance in contemporary society. By collecting and analysing 1500 valid questionnaires, combined with descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis, this study deeply discusses how the big data of the Internet of Things can optimise the evaluation method of the social influence of red culture, and puts forward effective improvement strategies. The results show that the application of IoT big data significantly improves the public’s awareness of red culture, and its data diversity, real-time performance and depth of analysis play a key role in improving the accuracy of assessment. The public’s emotional attitude towards and participation in red culture have a significant positive impact on the improvement of awareness. Based on the above findings, this study proposes to further enhance the communication effect and social influence of red culture by enhancing the innovation and interactivity of content, strengthening the personalised recommendation system, and utilising the big data of the Internet of Things for real-time monitoring and in-depth analysis. This study provides a new perspective and empirical evidence for how to use modern information technology to promote the dissemination of traditional culture, and has important theoretical and practical significance for guiding the inheritance and development of red culture.},

  abstract = {Currently, there is a considerable growth in the number of applications for loans of all forms. This is attributable to increased economic activity and lower interest rates on loans. However, although these loans create substantial money for financial institutions, they also pose a huge risk. The traditional approach to loan applicants includes auditors assessing them based on their prior employment experience; however, this method has the problem of being sluggish and imprecise. This article describes the creation of an intelligent loan evaluation system by inventively using oil consumption data. The system uses a decision tree model to fulfill the aim of constructing a system that can predict the rate of bad debt acquired by loan customers. As a requirement for system building, solutions to the following innovative difficulties have to be discovered. To get substantial results, a feature derivation approach and formula are used to the decision tree model. While significantly increasing review speed, the poor rate falls from 7.8% to 1.6%, while the approved rate rises from less than 17% to more than 45%. At the conclusion of this study, we attempt to enhance the method by using an ensemble approach, resulting in an overall performance improvement of roughly 5%.},

  abstract = {Deep mining at kilometer depths has become a trend in coal mining development. As a crucial method for green mining, backfill mining holds significant importance for “under-three” coal mining (mining under structures, water bodies, and railways). To investigate the surface strata movement patterns under conditions of large mining height in kilometer-deep mines, this study analyzed two working conditions—conventional mining and paste backfill mining—at a coal mine in China, based on the probability integral method and numerical simulation. The research found significant differences between the two methods calculated using the probability integral method. Under backfill mining conditions, ground deformation in the inclination and horizontal directions was only about 4.1% of that under conventional mining. Numerical simulation results indicated that during conventional mining, surface displacement showed little change when the working face advanced between 50 m and 200 m. However, a large fracture extending to the surface occurred in the roof strata at an advance distance of 200 m. When the advance reached 350 m–450 m, the rate of surface vertical displacement change slowed, with a maximum vertical subsidence of 1.26 m. In contrast, for paste backfill mining, surface horizontal displacement remained almost unchanged compared to conventional mining, but the vertical surface subsidence was reduced to 0.016 m, accounting for only 1.2% of the subsidence under conventional mining. Furthermore, backfill mining eliminated the zones and periods of intense strata subsidence. Comparing the two conditions shows that backfill mining reduces surface subsidence by dozens of times. This keeps building damage within Grade I (extremely slight damage), requiring no repair. The research results provide valuable references for understanding and controlling surface strata movement patterns in this mine and under similar mining conditions.},

Due to the existence of the frequency of the music wave, the electromagnetic wave less than its frequency cannot pass through the music wave, which makes the music wave can be used in the protection of high-power microwaves. The incident electromagnetic wave will be absorbed and reflected after entering the music wave. Therefore, a calculation model of the transmission power of the electromagnetic wave entering the music wave is proposed. From the analysis of teaching experiment data, it can be seen that the music appreciation model based on artificial neural network proposed in this paper can effectively improve students’ music appreciation ability.},

To address the current issue of poor adaptability and accuracy in cross-language text matching and translation, firstly, a multi-head attention mechanism and convolutional neural network are introduced. Moreover, a cross-language text matching model based on similarity-based attention convolutional neural network is constructed. Then, visual features are added to the Transformer model to build a real-time machine translation model based on the improved Transformer. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed text matching model could reach 83.42% when the epoch was 4. The proposed model achieved accuracy rates of 78.96%, 77.55%, and 79.86% in the experiment of matching French, German, and Spanish with English, respectively, while the accuracy rates were 79.16%, 75.03%, and 76.54% in the experiment of matching English with three languages. In addition, as the training data size increased from 1 M to 3 M, the Bilingual Evaluation Understud score of the proposed translation model improved by 36.45%, demonstrating good scalability.

  abstract = {Background:
            While psychedelics are often claimed to enhance creativity, their precise effects on distinct stages of creative cognition remain poorly understood. This study investigated the acute effects of an ayahuasca-inspired formulation combining N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine (DMT/HAR), as well as harmine alone (HAR), on micro-level (divergent/convergent thinking) and macro-level (creative process dynamics) creativity.
          
          
            Methods:
            In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design, 30 healthy male participants completed three sessions (DMT/HAR, HAR, placebo). Micro-level creativity was assessed using the picture concept task (convergent thinking) and alternative uses task (divergent thinking). Macro-level dynamics were examined through a real-world painting task using the creative process report diary, which captured dynamic stage transitions. Subjective experiences were also recorded to explore their predictive value for creativity.
          
          
            Results:
            DMT/HAR significantly impaired convergent thinking, particularly in individuals with higher baseline reasoning. Divergent thinking showed no overall effect but revealed trend-level reductions in fluency and elaboration under DMT/HAR. At the macro-level, both DMT/HAR and HAR reduced incubation-related transitions, while DMT/HAR uniquely decreased transitions from incubation to illumination, suggesting altered pathways to insight. Subjective experiences such as altered meaning perception and increased insightfulness selectively predicted divergent, but not convergent, thinking outcomes.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            This study demonstrates that the effects of DMT/HAR on creativity are not uniform. By capturing real-world creative behavior through an ecologically valid painting task, this study offers the first evidence that psychedelics influence not only creative cognition but also the dynamic processes that give rise to it. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive, phenomenological and process-level perspectives to better understand creative thinking under altered states. Future research should further investigate how individual differences in subjective experience and cognitive style modulate the unfolding of creative processes under psychedelics.},

Within this landscape, the information disseminated through take-out O2O platform reviews has emerged as a pivotal factor influencing consumer decisions when opting for food delivery services. This study centers on scrutinizing online reviews sourced from take-out O2O platforms. It establishes a research framework wherein online reviews function as the independent variable, consumer purchase intentions as the dependent variable, perceived risk as the mediator impacting the influence of online reviews on purchase intent, and consumer trust propensity as the moderator in the relationship between online reviews and perceived risk. Hypotheses are formulated and rigorously examined through empirical methodologies to ascertain the validity of the research framework and its underpinning assumptions. The findings of this study affirm that online reviews on take-out O2O platforms, encompassing criteria such as review quantity, quality, valence, timeliness, and visual cues, wield a marked positive influence on consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, online reviews exhibit a discernible negative impact on perceived risk. Notably, perceived risk plays a pivotal role as a partial mediator in the pathway through which online reviews influence consumer purchase intentions. Moreover, the study elucidates that consumer trust propensity operates as a vital moderator, particularly affecting how two key dimensions of online reviews—review valence and quality—influence perceived risk. This moderating effect manifests as a mechanism that introduces a mitigating influence to a certain extent.},

Existing recommendation models often cannot handle complex user-item interaction networks and are difficult to fully explore the deep connection between user preferences and books. To address this problem, the study proposes a novel intelligent recommendation model that uniquely integrates the structural representation ability of Graph Neural Networks with the dynamic feature extraction ability of attention mechanisms. This innovative combination enables the simultaneous capture of complex user-item topological relationships and adaptive importance weighting of heterogeneous features, which has not been extensively explored in library recommendation systems. The model uses a multi-head attention mechanism for adaptive feature selection and combines residual connections to ensure the effective flow of information in the deep network. Experimental results show that on the Amazon book dataset, the proposed fusion model outperforms traditional deep learning methods and improves the recommendation accuracy by more than 15%. In the actual deployment of a university library, the recommendation coverage of the fusion model reached 89.2%, the user satisfaction score was 4.52 points (out of 5 points), and the recommendation accuracy in multiple subject areas remained above 85%. These results show that the fusion model effectively reveals deep relationships, solves the challenges of modeling dynamic user interests and diverse book features, and provides reliable technical support for the intelligent and personalized reading recommendation system of modern libraries.},

Further, this paper adopts the panel unit root test, and the panel unit root test also believes that there is price convergence in the regional housing market. Moreover, this paper adopts two methods: separate regression and seemingly irrelevant regression to estimate the adjustment speed, and the results obtained by the seemingly irrelevant regression method are more effective and reliable.

  abstract = {With the speedy prosperity of artificial intelligence and sensor technology, the application of action recognition in football is becoming increasingly widespread. However, due to the rapid changes, complex dynamics, and diverse characteristics of football movements, traditional recognition methods face significant challenges in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Based on this background, a football recognition model combining network wearable sensors and improved support vector machine classification algorithm is proposed. Firstly, by integrating the attitude data of accelerometers and gyroscopes, real-time dynamic features such as pitch angle, roll angle, and yaw angle are calculated, and principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction processing. Subsequently, the support vector machine model is optimized based on Gaussian kernel function and dynamic weighting strategy to improve classification accuracy and stability. Finally, a football action recognition model is constructed by combining wearable sensors with an improved support vector machine classification algorithm. The experiment outcomes show that the improved support vector machine algorithm achieves an action recognition accuracy of 93.8%, a recall rate of 92.5%, an F1 value of 0.92, and an inference time of 10.2 ms, which are significantly better than the comparative algorithm. In practical applications, the recognition model built has an accuracy rate of over 90% in recognizing four types of actions: standing, running, passing, and shooting, with an average recognition time as low as 9.4 ms. The research provides an efficient solution for intelligent football action recognition technology and lays the foundation for the practical application of multi-modal data fusion.},

  abstract = {Fashion design is a comprehensive art that combines creativity, aesthetics, technology, and other aspects. By designing and combining elements such as clothing styles, colors, and image styles, fashion works with unique styles and practical functions are created. However, the existing clothing design methods all have defects such as poor image accuracy and long generation cycle. Therefore, this study optimizes the Cycle Consistency-Generative Adversarial Network by introducing Least Squares and Efficient Channel Attention Network, and constructs a brand-new intelligent fashion design image generation model based on this. The results show that this model achieves an accuracy of 97.1%, an average success rate of 96.8%, and a 37 dB image signal-to-noise ratio, significantly outperforming the comparison models. Meanwhile, when generating a substantial volume of clothing designs, the model maintained a peak response time of merely 229 ms and a minimal loss rate of 0.17%. And it achieved a score of 97.3 in a questionnaire based on the esthetic ratings of 200 users. In conclusion, the proposed model not only generates higher-quality, more detailed images but also ensures high precision and success rates. The clothing designs are widely accepted by the public, meet modern esthetic standards, and effectively address the challenges of existing fashion design methods, and is conducive to designing higher-quality fashion garments.},

  abstract = {As the earliest form of writing and historical cultural heritage in China, oracle bone inscriptions carry immeasurable density of historical information and potential for academic research. However, due to the age and preservation environment, the quality of many oracle bone images is severely impaired, resulting in problems such as text edge wear, loss of details, and blurred handwriting, which greatly limits the ability of scholars to accurately interpret the contents of the oracle bones and explore them in depth. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image enhancement and calibration system, which realizes multi-level information recovery and geometric correction from micro to macro by applying an advanced deep learning model to capture the minute features, delicate textures and original layouts of oracle bone images. The model in this paper consists of two main parts, that is, generator network G and discriminator network D. The task of generator G is to generate images consistent with the real data distribution based on random noise variables and possibly additional condition information (e.g., category labels, attributes, etc.), which should mimic or satisfy as much as possible the features of the real image under the given conditions. The discriminator D, on the other hand, is responsible for receiving the input real image or the fake image generated by the generator and outputs a probability value that reflects the probability that it considers the image to be a real sample, that is, the truthfulness or trustworthiness of the image. The model in this paper achieves the functions of image quality assessment and authenticity judgment, image recovery and optimization, image enhancement and proofreading by means of adversarial training. Experimental evaluations are carried out on two representative oracle image datasets, OBI-100 and OBI-300, and the effectiveness and superiority of this paper’s method in improving the clarity and readability of oracle images, as well as accurately recognizing oracle characters and extracting oracle information, are verified by comparing it with other image enhancement and reweighting methods. The effectiveness and superiority of the method is verified. The method of this paper provides a new technical means for the research and inheritance of oracle bone inscriptions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the task of generating captions for videos has become a prominent research focus, with its main challenge being how to effectively capture essential semantic elements – such as objects, actions, and their spatial-temporal relationships – from abundant and redundant visual content. To address this challenge, earlier methods generally concentrate on either extracting representative clips across multiple frames (global level) or locating salient areas within single frames (local level). Many existing methods tend to ignore the fundamental hierarchical organization of videos, where identifying representative frames should come before locating informative regions. To tackle this limitation, we propose G2L, a hierarchical attention framework that (1) selects salient clips &amp; frames via differentiable Gumbel Top-K sampling and (2) refines region-level context for caption generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely adopted benchmarks MSVD and MSR-VTT confirm that our method achieves notable improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablations confirm that the global-to-local cascade and dual-branch optimization jointly account for the gain.},

  abstract = {In power distribution networks, the correct identification of network topology and parameters is critical in maintaining efficient operating conditions. Operative efficiency and reliability are major goals in such networks. Satisfying these conditions necessitates a clear understanding of network parameters and topology, particularly in low-voltage power distribution networks, which are typically characterized by complicated patterns and fluctuating load demands. This research presents a novel approach utilizing the Voltage Regulator Weighted Topology Recurrent Neural Network (VR-WT-RNN) for joint identification of parameters and topology in low-voltage distribution networks. The Low-Voltage Network Dataset is used to capture time-series data from five nodes in a low-voltage electrical distribution network, and Z-score normalization was used for data preprocessing. The VR-WT-RNN approach combines weighted topology considerations within a recurrent neural network structure, enhancing its ability to accurately model and predict sophisticated network behaviors. Using records of voltage regulator settings, load profiles, and network configurations, the model can predict both network parameters and topology. The performance of the VR-WT-RNN model shows an effectiveness of up to 5% accuracy improvement for Transformer 2, accompanied by significant gains in NMI and ARI over traditional methods. Further, the responsiveness of the model towards dynamic variations of network conditions marks its usability within changing operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Multimodal sentiment analysis is a well-known field in AI that integrates text, video, and audio to gain a better understanding of people’s emotions. However, this field still faces two major challenges: first, it is difficult to effectively eliminate noise interference in multimodal data; Second, the existing research focuses on the fusion mechanism between modes, ignoring the similarity and heterogeneity between modes, which leads to the deviation of emotional analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep fusion model based on Transformer. We define the polarity vector (PV) and the intensity vector (SV) based on the emotion analysis strategy of PS-Mixer to judge the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) and intensity (0–3 range) of emotions, respectively. PV fuses text and video features, and SV fuses text and audio features and improves the ability of feature expression by introducing a cross-fusion strategy. Transformer architecture enhances the generalization performance and large-scale data processing ability of the model. The experimental results show that the performance of this model on MOSI and MOSEI datasets is better than the existing multi-modal sentiment analysis methods, which provides a new idea for research in this field.},

  abstract = {Accurate medical image segmentation models can efficiently assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis. Segmentation methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in extracting local features. However, due to their inherently limited receptive fields, they exhibit shortcomings in integrating global dependencies and extracting multi-scale features. This limitation of CNNs has prompted researchers to explore Transformer-based approaches. This shift is driven by the unique self-attention mechanism of Transformers, which effectively models global dependencies and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. In this study, we designed a medical image segmentation model called FRISFormer, based on a U-shaped architecture. FRISFormer is entirely built on the Transformer architecture and possesses the characteristic of being effectively trainable without the need for pre-trained models. Specifically, the innovation of FRISFormer is primarily reflected in two key aspects: (1) FRISFormer refines the features extracted by the Efficient Self-Attention (ESA) module through a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN), further achieving deep deconstruction and enhancement of features. (2) FRISFormer replaces the classic skip connections with a ReMixed Transformer Context Bridge, effectively promoting the correlation between global dependencies and local context. This study tested FRISFormer on the multi-organ segmentation dataset (Synapse) and the skin lesion segmentation dataset (ISIC 2018). On the Synapse dataset, FRISFormer improved the test metric by 0.50, while on the ISIC dataset, the test metric improved by 0.23. The experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FRISFormer in feature representation and segmentation accuracy.},

  abstract = {The fractional order accumulation calculation process in traditional grey system theory is too complex and has poor effectiveness in predicting carbon dioxide emissions in practical applications. A new non-equidistant grey model is proposed to address the above issues, which introduces a C-type fractional order cumulative derivative to simplify the calculation of fractional order accumulation. At the same time, introducing a dynamic fractional order adjustment strategy can adaptively optimize the fractional order value based on data characteristics, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the model in predicting carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the C-type fractional order cumulative non-uniform grey model (1,1) is obtained. The research results show that compared with existing advanced non-equidistant GM (1,1) models based on integration, non-equidistant grey prediction models based on residual correction, and hybrid multi-scale machine learning models, the research method achieves higher accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency. Its average absolute percentage error in performance testing is the lowest at only 1.987%, significantly better than other models. In practical applications, the research method has an average absolute percentage error of less than 10% in both foreign and domestic data prediction. Overall, this model can be applied in practical prediction of carbon dioxide emissions and provide data reference for achieving the goal of “carbon neutrality.”},

  abstract = {This paper selects sample data from state-owned A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2018. Based on the calculation and determination of excessive on-the-job consumption, three indicators are defined to measure the depth of enterprise reform: diversity of mixed subjects, deepness of mixed subjects, and check and balance degree of mixed main body. Models are established and empirical tests are conducted through group analysis. The results show that all three indicators—diversity of mixed subjects, deepness of mixed subjects, and check and balance degree of mixed main body—significantly inhibit the level of excessive on-the-job consumption by executives, and this inhibitory effect is significant at the level of 1%. This paper finds that the higher the degree of enterprise reform, the lower the level of excess consumption; By the types of industries, compared with monopoly industries, the inhibitory effect of enterprise reform on excess consumption is more obvious in non-monopoly industries. Further research shows that in areas with a high degree of marketization, mixed ownership has a stronger inhibitory effect on excess consumption.},

  abstract = {At present, when planning the allocation of recreational green space in urban and rural areas, there is often a cognitive bias against rural recreational green space, and planners, designers, and government officials often think that the countryside is a productive green space, so they do not set up a special leisure green space for rural residents to use. Therefore, this study first analyzed the relevant data of the National Leisure Life Survey and the Guizhou Provincial Statistical Survey Corps Family Housing Survey, and compared and discussed the degree of urbanization, the distance to leisure places, the demand for community parks, and the demand for activity centers. Secondly, 112 residents and 236 residents sampled by random telephone were selected from the household income and expenditure survey of the Guizhou Provincial Statistical Survey Corps, and the questionnaire survey and empirical research were carried out to further evaluate the differences in residents’ demand for green space according to the different attributes of urban and rural residences (urban, intermediary, and rural). The results of this study show that both the data analysis and the empirical research obtained by the Guizhou Provincial Statistical Survey Corps confirm that urban and rural residents have a demand for recreational green space, indicating that no significant difference was found in the demand for recreational green space between urban and rural residents. Green space is important for both urban and rural residents, and the results of this study hope to reverse the bias of policymakers on the planning strategy of urban and rural recreational green space.},

  abstract = {Contemporary language education aims to promote 21st-century core thinking-related competencies. Achieving this goal requires empowered teachers with strong beliefs and practices that support effective language instruction. In this context, English-as-a-foreign-language instructors’ understanding of creative and critical thinking plays a crucial role in integrating critical thinking standards into English language teaching, thereby fostering multiple competencies. This study examines English-as-a-foreign-language instructors’ critical thinking cognition, practices, and dispositions, along with their interdependence. Employing a concurrent mixed-methods approach, the research combines quantitative analysis with in-depth exploration. Ninety-two instructors were selected using systematic random sampling from three Ethiopian universities and participated by responding to structured and open-ended questionnaires. Quantitative data were analyzed using percentages,
            t
            -tests, and multiple linear regression techniques, whereas qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. Findings indicate that although instructors demonstrate awareness and familiarity with critical thinking, many struggle to conceptualize it fully. Most instructors often focus on lower-order critical thinking standards and engage students in less cognitively demanding activities. This tendency is frequently attributed to challenges within the educational environment, diverse student backgrounds, and limitations in instructors’ own preparedness. To address these issues, it is recommended to implement awareness-raising initiatives, provide professional development training, and facilitate discussions aimed at enhancing instructors’ understanding and application of critical thinking.},

  abstract = {In response to the severe outbreak of COVID-19, the world is making every effort to promote vaccination. The Chinese government reports on the progress of the epidemic and related information about vaccines through the media, especially the official media, which has some influence on residents’ attitude and vaccination behavior. But few studies have discussed the potential public health impact of vaccines on social media and analyzed them alongside the impact of official media. In addition, from the perspective of SEIR models and the diffusion of knowledge, it is proposed that information about the epidemic situation and knowledge of vaccines before infection will prompt rural residents in central China to correctly understand vaccines and take the initiative to vaccinate. A survey of 1453 rural residents in Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces in central China showed that residents’ belief in official media coverage affecting vaccination behavior was established, while entertainment network platforms hindered the dissemination of health knowledge due to excessive entertainment information. In addition, perceived effectiveness, perceived security, perceived hazard, and knowledge related to vaccines can affect vaccination behavior. In this study, the influence factors of media information on vaccination behavior were discussed in theory and practice.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of technology, the inclusion problem of piezoelectric materials has gradually become a key research object. The aim of this study is to solve the relative rigid body displacement of Eshelby inclusion in piezoelectric materials. An improved Eshelby boundary element method is proposed, which combines the displacement extrapolation method to accurately calculate the mechanical properties of piezoelectric materials by introducing a strength factor. The improved method not only improves the calculation accuracy, but also effectively deals with the relative displacement of inclusions in piezoelectric materials. In the experiment, gallium arsenide is taken as an object, and the effectiveness of the improved method is verified by comparing J-integral method with stress method. The experimental results show that when the intensity factor is 1, 2, and 3, the error rates of generalized displacement calculation are 0.67%, 0.46%, and 0.39%, respectively. The errors of this method are 0.15%, 0.12%, 0.16%, 0.14%, and 0.16%, respectively, when measuring the relative displacement of inclusions and rigid bodies. These results show that the Eshelby boundary element method improved by displacement extrapolation has significant advantages in the treatment of boundary conditions and displacement analysis of piezoelectric materials. The improved method can effectively solve the problem of relative displacement of inclusions in piezoelectric materials, and has wide application prospect and high practical value.},

            century education, creativity is widely regarded as one of the essential qualities that students must possess. With the increasing demand for personalized teaching, accurately measuring students’ creativity and effectively enhancing it has become a focal point of current educational research. Traditional methods of educational assessment fall short in terms of personalized recommendations and long-term effect evaluation, failing to meet the needs of modern education. In contrast, the potential exhibited by artificial intelligence technologies, especially neural networks in data processing and behavioral analysis, offers new possibilities for addressing these issues. The efficiency and flexibility of Graph Attention Networks (GANs) in handling complex relational data, in particular, provide novel tools for the scientific measurement and enhancement of creativity. However, existing research is insufficient in exploring the impact of group interactions on creativity and assessing the long-term effects of personalized educational interventions. This study initially utilizes GANs to establish an innovative model for group activity recommendation, aimed at analyzing students’ personality traits and levels of creativity to recommend activities best suited for unleashing their creative potential. Subsequently, a weighted network approach is employed to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of creative enhancement following participation in recommended activities, examining the impact of various educational intervention strategies. This research not only extends the application of neural networks in the field of education but also offers new methodological support for personalized teaching, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for optimizing educational resource allocation and enhancing educational quality.},

Traditional protection methods are difficult to adapt to the complex and changeable ecological environment, and innovative technical means are urgently needed. This study aims to integrate the Internet of Things and deep reinforcement learning technology to build a forest ecological protection strategy optimization and decision support system to improve protection efficiency and scientificity. A comprehensive perception of forest ecology is achieved by deploying sensoreal times to monitor forest environmental parameters in real life, such as temperature, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, a protection strategy optimization model is established, and the optimal strategy is learned by simulating the protection measures in different situations. Experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, this system can improve the effectiveness of the protection strategy by 30% and significantly reduce the waste of resources. In the simulated 1000-hectare forest area, after adopting this system, the vegetation coverage rate increased by 20%, and the species diversity index increased by 15%. In addition, the system also has a real-time decision support function, which can dynamically adjust protection strategies according to real-time data to respond to sudden environmental changes.

A high-performance priority queue scheduling mechanism driven by artificial intelligence is proposed to address the low efficiency and easy blocking of traditional priority queue scheduling mechanisms in software defined network data planes. This mechanism avoids queue head blocking by improving the deficit round robin algorithm, ensures fair allocation of output bandwidth for differentiated fine-grained priority queues, and guarantees maximum forwarding delay. The results show that this method significantly improves performance compared to traditional algorithms, as it can process and forward data packets faster, thereby reducing latency and increasing throughput. Specifically, the average round-trip time of the deficit round robin algorithm is 8.21 ms, compared to 3.89 ms for this method, which reduces 4.72 ms. The highest average throughput of the deficit round robin algorithm is 60.01 Mbps, compared to 105.99 Mbps for this method, which improves by 76.62%. After improving the algorithm, the software defined a network data plane system with an average frame delay of 2.81 ms and a packet loss rate of 4.50%. The amount of data transmitted by the improved system was basically the same as when it was not attacked, with an availability rate of 98.6%. The improved algorithm can better ensure the smoothness of transmission services. This provides a new direction for future research on new network architecture technologies and has certain economic value.},

The sentiment aspect was divided into three categories of “Positive,” “Negative,” and “Neutral,” and the content aspect was divided into three categories of “course,” “platform environment,” and “other.” In the collection and processing of data sets, an effective data set that accurately represents the characteristics of the education field is constructed by utilizing comments obtained from the NetEase Cloud course platform. The HuggingFace open source Bert pre-training model is then employed for word vector training.

The proposed architecture consists of three key components: a temporal pyramid multi-scale convolutional module to extract hierarchical periodic features across hourly, daily, and weekly levels; a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) module to capture global temporal de-pendencies in both forward and backward directions; and an attention mechanism to dynamically emphasize critical time steps.

  abstract = {Purpose:
            To present our approach to zygomatic osteotomy and repositioning using technological aids: virtual surgical planning, custom guides, and implants.
            Background:
            The zygomatic complex is highly 3-dimensional, establishing cheek prominence, facial width, and orbital morphology. Functionally, the zygoma supports soft tissues and is vital to mastication. The zygoma may require reconstruction after a variety of congenital or acquired conditions; however, Zygomatic Osteotomy and Repositioning (ZyOaR) is a complex operation with many technical considerations. The advent of virtual surgical planning (VSP) has enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility, while permitting utilization of custom-designed guides and implants. There remains a paucity of literature on ZyOaR and its unique challenges.
            Methods:
            This case series includes all patients older than 18 years old undergoing ZyOaR with VSP between 2010 and 2024. Demographics and clinical etiology were noted. Outcomes included fidelity to preoperative plan, facial symmetry, mastication defects, and globe malposition.
            Results:
            Eight patients age 18 to 60 years old (mean = 38) met inclusion criteria. Three patients had congenital deformities, and 5 were post-traumatic. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 50 months (mean = 17 months). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patient had visual changes at latest follow-up. Preoperative VSP plans were compared to postoperative CT scans, showing a high degree of fidelity. All patients underwent secondary reconstructive and/or soft tissue procedures to achieve final results.
            Conclusions:
            Zygomatic Osteotomy and Repositioning (ZyOaR) is inherently difficult, and there is a current gap in the literature on its unique technical challenges. We present 8 cases of ZyOaR using VSP for patients with a range of disease etiologies. The procedures were well tolerated and maintained high surgical fidelity. In our experience, keys to optimize ZyOaR include comprehensive analysis of regional bony and soft tissue anatomy, virtual planning with production and use of surgical transfer guides, and custom 3D printed patient-specific implants.},

Using Multiple Resource Theory’s (MRT) computational model, an iterative approach was employed to evaluate each factor’s contribution. Incorporating resource conflict improved model fit over a demand-only baseline, and adding a visual penalty to account for angle separation further enhanced prediction accuracy. Task-specific results showed greater interference in the digit task, suggesting that task priority influences susceptibility to interference. Overall, the results highlight the importance of incorporating resource conflict and perceptual factors, such as visual angle separation, into computational models of dual-task interference.},

  abstract = {To accurately extract the topological features of brain functional networks from electroencephalogram signals of patients with schizophrenia, this study proposes a functional brain network model that uses a graph convolutional neural network to integrate frequency bands, segment lengths, and functional connectivity indexes. It combines time-frequency domain features and brain network topological features to divide electroencephalogram signals into different frequency bands and length epochs. This allows for the analysis of characteristic values of electroencephalogram signals of schizophrenic patients. Through comparative trials, the study evaluates the suggested model’s performance. The results revealed that the proposed model obtained an average accuracy of 91.12% using the phase-locked value functional connectivity metric at Theta frequency band and 6-s segment length, which was 2.85%, 8.74%, and 3.95% higher compared to the support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and temporal convolutional network models, respectively, and demonstrated a superior recognition performance. In addition, network topology analysis revealed that the parietal region was an important region in the brain network of schizophrenic patients. The proposed model is reliable and feasible for detecting schizophrenic patients. It can extract topological features from electroencephalogram signals to characterize the functional brain networks of patients with schizophrenia. These features can then be correlated with clinical symptom salience, which is expected to aid in diagnosis.},

  abstract = {With the growing maturity of the “technology” + “teaching” integration model, the ethical and legal issues related to AI in English language teaching have become more and more prominent. However, the previous literature has not systematically explored the factors that cause AI ethics and law in English language teaching, nor has it made suggestions to address these factors. Therefore, this paper explores in depth the origins, manifestations, and solutions of these ethical and legal issues. Firstly, through the literature review method, we explore the ethical and legal issues surrounding AI in English language teaching and its impact on teachers and students, and find that these ethical and legal issues have a significant effect on enhancing the legal awareness of students and teachers. Moreover, based on the literature review method, this paper identifies eight influencing factors and determines the weights of each factor through the method of multiple linear regression, and it can be seen that automated decision-making and accountability (X3) and teacher roles and competence (X4) have the greatest weights and are the key factors leading to ethical and legal issues. Finally, this paper also formulates targeted recommendations in response to the experimental results, such as respecting students’ and teachers’ privacy and autonomy, maintaining teachers’ professionalism and accountability, and complying with laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines.},

With the growing popularity of online learning, the efficient distribution of personalized learning resources has become a key research area. By addressing the limitations of traditional methods and integrating advanced optimization techniques, the proposed system offers superior performance in terms of clustering accuracy, convergence speed, and adaptability. The detailed analysis of optimization algorithms’ categories and recent developments further positions this research within the broader context of educational technology advancements. The clustering accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 37.13% when processing the Iris dataset. This relatively low accuracy is partly attributed to the Iris dataset’s inherent complexity, including class overlap and subtle feature differences between clusters. It also indicates potential for further optimization, such as refining the distance measurement method for overlapping classes. The experimental evaluation shows that on the Iris and Wine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the clustering accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 37.13% and 41.22%, respectively. Compared with the traditional K-Means algorithm, its convergence speed is increased by 4.5 times, where convergence speed is measured by both the number of iterations required to reach stable clustering results and the computational time.},

Based on data from 124 students in Beijing, the findings show that scientific critical and judgmental ability positively affects S-HOT. Extracurricular reading enhances S-HOT indirectly through learning engagement or in combination with scientific critical and judgmental ability. However, excessive learning engagement may have a negative impact. fsQCA reveals six distinct factor combinations that contribute to S-HOT, highlighting the presence of multiple effective pathways. These findings offer both theoretical insight and practical guidance for the targeted development of higher-order thinking in science education.},

However, traditional network access control technologies generally suffer from limitations such as static verification cycles, single authorization methods, and a lack of continuous behavior tracking, making it difficult to address dynamic and complex network threats. To address this, the study proposes a network access control model based on the zero-trust security concept, integrating dynamic authorization verification methods to keep user verification in a continuous and dynamic state, thereby enhancing the system’s overall protective capabilities. Through simulation experiments, the results show that compared to KNN, SVM, and MLP models, the proposed ZT-DA model achieves an accuracy rate of 98.4% and a false positive rate of 3.8% when accessing 400 times, with clearer classification boundaries, enabling more accurate distinction between normal and abnormal behavior. When the sample size is 200, the trust calculation times for different stages are 78 ms, 65 ms, and 70 ms, respectively. In practical applications, the model achieved an interception rate of 100%, a false interception rate of 0%, and a control range of 100%. The research results indicate that the model can monitor threat behaviors in real time, effectively intercept malicious attacks, and enhance information security protection capabilities with a lower false positive rate while ensuring a smooth user network experience.},

By mapping the children’s movements within three storied-play encounters, we animate how what could appear as the most ordinary and mundane ways of composing story in outdoor, open-ended and make-believe play, offers a lively form of protestation to the predominant Western narrative paradigm of beginning-middle-end story structure. Bringing the three moments into conversation with literary theorist Marielle Macé’s concept of narrative stylization, we attend to ways story lives and grows within children’s storied and playful worldbuilding. Ultimately, we argue that limiting instructional methods to that which is centred around the objectification and rationalization of storying (i.e., typical beginning-middle-end story structure) can displace other pedagogical directions that recognize and extend the myriad ways in which stories are made, learned, and understood. We conclude the article with an exploration of how educators might promote and build upon the narrative stylizations – fiction-in-the-doing – that children are always already engaging in their storied play.},

Based on this, this study proposes a resume screening and career matching model based on Fuzzy Natural Language Processing (Fuzzy NLP), which aims to optimize the intelligent matching process between talents and positions by using cutting-edge technology. The model deeply integrates fuzzy logic theory and semantic analysis technology, and constructs a multi-dimensional semantic understanding framework to refine the analysis of resumes and job descriptions, effectively eliminate the semantic ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language, and break through the bottleneck of traditional methods at the level of semantic understanding. In the empirical research phase, the research team systematically tested a real-world dataset of 5000 resumes and 1000 job information. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional keyword matching method, the proposed model achieves a significant improvement of 25% to 85% in the matching accuracy, and accurately captures the potential relationship between job requirements and candidates’ abilities through dynamic weight adjustment and semantic similarity measurement mechanism. In terms of screening efficiency, the model helps optimize the recruitment process, shortens the manual review time by 30%, and significantly reduces labor and time costs. Especially when dealing with fuzzy semantic descriptions and polysemy word scenarios, the model reduces the false positive rate by 20% through context perception and fuzzy rule reasoning, showing excellent semantic understanding ability and robustness. This study not only verifies the practical value and technical advantages of fuzzy natural language processing technology in the field of human resource management but also provides theoretical support and methodological reference for promoting the intelligent transformation of the recruitment process, which is expected to build a more efficient and accurate talent screening system for enterprises and help human resource management move towards a new stage of intelligent and scientific development.},

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly reduces the communication overhead compared to that of existing dual-layer consensus and IoT-based architectures. With 40 nodes, it achieves just 302 transactions of overhead at 50 TPS and a minimal system memory usage of 0.502% at 40 TPS. Furthermore, at a high throughput of 120 TPS, the algorithm completes transactions in only 53.47 ms—far faster than competing methods.

  abstract = {Infectious diseases have always been a focus of global public health attention. However, the current methods for analyzing and predicting the trend of infectious disease transmission are not comprehensive, resulting in significant discrepancies in the analysis results. To address this issue, a differential equation model of infectious diseases with latent periods is proposed for Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible. On this basis, a staged model combined with logistic regression is established. Finally, in response to the problem of missing data related to infectious diseases in certain regions, LSTM networks and autoregressive integrated moving average models are used for prediction to assist differential equation models in disease transmission analysis. Through empirical analysis, it is known that the fitting degree between the results obtained from the infectious disease differential equation model proposed in the study and the actual results reaches 0.95, with a root mean square error of 0.03 and an average relative error of 3.5%. The prediction model proposed in the study achieves an accuracy of 92.72%, reaching convergence accuracy and convergence loss values after only 23 and 22 iterations.

  abstract = {While natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in high-resource languages (HRLs), many languages still lack sufficient representation in training data. Many more such languages remain underrepresented in training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning (CTLT) has been proposed as an exciting use case where an application of these text classifiers trained on HRLs will be extended to low-resource languages (LRLs), mostly using zero and few-shot techniques. This notwithstanding, conventional multilingual language models usually underperform in some languages. Using classification along with language modeling does not work for all language combinations for optimal results. The approach that we propose is MT-TC: a new hybrid framework upon which the traditional translate-test approach can be revisited and refined. That is, MT-TC combines a text classifier trained in the high-resource language with a neural machine translation (NMT) model. Because it enjoys “soft” differentiable translations, backpropagation can be performed end-to-end on an architecture to jointly fine-tune both components. We evaluate MT-TC on Taxi1500 dataset with 20 typologically diverse languages. The macro F1-score reaches 0.88 for the proposed method, outperforming baseline multilingual models by as much as 12.5% in low-resource settings. These results show that under the aspect of minimum-annotated data availability, MT-TC performs significantly well and qualifies itself as a very within-real-world-scalable solution for a lot of multilingual NLP applications.},

  abstract = {The development of classroom teaching evaluation in China is still in its infancy, despite the country’s rapid growth in music education. The quality of music instruction is not scientifically and reasonably evaluated based on actual teaching quality. When it comes to teaching and evaluating music, music teachers simply follow the classroom teaching evaluation indicators and models of any other topic in the school. An evaluation system that is merely a form, and does not have any meaningful impact on evaluation, feedback, or promotion is inevitable as a result of this. That’s why a deep-level, in-depth study of music classroom teaching’s quality evaluation system is still needed, along with a theoretical-and-practical combination. This work takes the music teaching as the starting point to carry out the corresponding research. First, this work builds a music teaching quality evaluation system via B/S architecture. It includes three parts: client, application unit, and database. The application unit includes user management, online evaluation, data management, evaluation result query and analysis. After users enter the system, they will score the teaching quality. Second, this work proposes the use of multi-scale convolution to extract data features, and proposes an improved attention mechanism to construct MS-IATT-CNN for evaluating music teaching quality. Third, this work has carried out a comprehensive and systematic experiment, and the experimental data has verified the feasibility of this work.},

Traditional human pose recognition models no longer meet the practical requirements of aerobics scenarios. To address this, the study is based on open pose estimation technology, optimized with attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, and proposes a hybrid human pose recognition model. Performance validation and ablation experiments show that the model have an accuracy of 95% and a loss value as low as 0.0089. The highest score for human key points is 7.5, with angle error and position error reduced to 4.9% and 5.4%, respectively, outperforming the base algorithm. This highlights the success of the proposed optimization and enhancement techniques. In practical application comparison experiments, the recognition model achieves a running time of 8 ms when recognizing 150 images, significantly outperforming the comparison models. In multi-person recognition experiments, the proposed model reaches an accuracy of 93%. Additionally, the model shows superior performance in visualizing human pose recognition in practical scenarios.

WI-FI has brought many positive changes to the lifestyle of college students, and has also had many negative effects on college students. Under the WI-FI environment, college students’ health is worrying. The number of “head-downers” on campus has increased sharply, and the phenomenon of dependence on the WI-FI has become more and more serious, which seriously endangers the health of students. In view of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis in the WI-FI environment, hoping to understand its specific impact and propose effective solutions based on its existing problems. By analyzing the impact of WI-FI environment on college students’ physical and mental health, find out the specific types of morbidity caused by WI-FI environment on college students’ physical and mental health.

The multimodal language models exhibit fundamentally different characteristics from earlier machine learning approaches, and present unique challenges and opportunities for designers. A key question for design research arises: How can the capabilities of these large multimodal models become part of our design tools? This work investigates how the recent development of reasoning language models in particular can be utilized for early stage exploratory design. We outline a set of principles to build effective tools with these models by drawing from research in artificial intelligence. Specifically, we explore the application of the new reasoning model paradigm in computational design scripting. We present a system which successfully generates computer-aided design (CAD) scripts in Grasshopper. The system is compared to existing CAD AI approaches for its capabilities and characteristics. High latency and the absence of a user-model feedback loop still restrict real-time exploration in our system. Our developed principles can further inform broad exploratory tools and motivate inquiries into multimodal reasoning for design. By demonstrating a new CAD approach, we show large models’ utility as creative tools. Future research should address latency, enhance interactivity, and address other design tasks beyond CAD.},

  abstract = {As the world transitions toward a more sustainable and digitalized energy landscape, the management of grid assets has become increasingly complex and critical to ensuring the efficient delivery of electricity. The integration of renewable energy systems (RES) with grid-connected load infrastructures has proven to be an effective solution for enhancing system reliability and reducing transmission losses. However, this integration often introduces power quality (PQ) issues, such as voltage sags, swells, and fluctuations, which can compromise grid stability. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel solution for sustainable digital grid asset management using the Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) and Weighted Salp Swarm Driven One-Class Support Vector Machine (WSS-OCSVM), which integrates the Weighted Salp Swarm Algorithm (WSSA) with Weighted One-Class Support Vector Machine (WOCSVM). The approach aims to mitigate PQ disturbances, optimize asset disposal strategies, and evaluate the ecological impact of grid components. The methodology is implemented in several stages: first, the UPQC is used to regulate power quality, followed by the integration of WSS-OCSVM to optimize decision-making processes for asset management. This system is further enhanced by the SEASWARM platform, which enables intelligent adaptation and decision-making for asset disposal, considering environmental factors like carbon emissions and recyclability. The efficacy of the suggested method is confirmed by MATLAB simulation studies, which show better performance than existing techniques. Although evaluated on the 39-bus system, the suggested UPQC + WSS-OCSVM approach produced results of 99.94% accuracy. The results indicate that the UPQC + WSS-OCSVM model moderates PQ disturbances and also optimizes asset lifecycle management and promotes ecological sustainability. This comprehensive solution offers a significant advancement in the development of intelligent, resilient, and environmentally conscious modern power grids.},

  abstract = {With rapid development of information technology, virtual simulation technology has gradually integrated into the teaching system of vocational colleges and has become an important means to improve teaching quality and effect. However, the existing teaching feedback mechanism is often single and lagging, and it is not easy to comprehensively and in real time reflect the teaching effect and students’ learning status. Therefore, this study aims to explore how virtual simulation technology can optimize the multi-level feedback mechanism in the information teaching of vocational colleges to realize the precise regulation and personalized guidance of the teaching process. Vocational colleges pay attention to cultivating practical skills, and virtual simulation technology can provide a working environment close to accurate, effectively making up for the shortcomings of traditional teaching. However, the lack of adequate feedback mechanism makes it difficult to maximize the teaching effect. This study constructed a multi-level feedback system based on virtual simulation technology, including three levels: real-time interactive feedback, phased evaluation feedback and comprehensive analysis feedback. In the experiment, we selected 1000 students and 50 teachers from three vocational colleges as the research objects and carried out a one-semester teaching practice. The experimental results show that after the introduction of a multi-level feedback mechanism, students’ academic performance has improved by 20% on average, their practical skills have improved by 25%, and their learning satisfaction has reached 90%. At the same time, teachers’ teaching efficiency has increased by 15%, and their teaching satisfaction has reached 95%. In addition, the accuracy rate of real-time feedback of the system reaches 88%, the accuracy rate of phased evaluation reaches 92%, and the accuracy rate of comprehensive analysis reaches 95%. Virtual simulation technology optimizes the multi-level feedback mechanism in information teaching of vocational colleges, which can significantly improve teaching and students’ learning effects, and provide strong support for innovation and development of vocational education.},

This research introduces a novel hybrid model, Logistic Regression-Weighted Random Forest (LR-WRF), combining the benefits of Logistic Regression (LR) and Weighted Random Forest (WRF) to automate asset classification and disposal predictions. The system collects historical data, including asset ID, location, usage history, maintenance logs, and physical condition, which are pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and normalise formats. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for feature extraction, reducing data dimensionality while retaining essential information. A Weighted Random Forest (WRF) classifier is then used to categorise assets into operational states such as Active, Degraded, or Obsolete. To predict disposal eligibility, a Logistic Regression model assesses whether an asset should be retained, sold, recycled, or discarded. The experimental results show that the LR-WRF model provides high classification accuracy and offers effective disposal recommendations, significantly reducing manual intervention and ensuring compliance with asset lifecycle policies. The proposed model was evaluated across a variety of metrics, including accuracy (98.82%), precision, recall, and F1-score.

  abstract = {With rapid development of information technology, intelligent education has become an important research direction. English learning is an integral part of education, and its learning behavior analysis and teaching optimization have attracted much attention. Based on the SSA-GRU (Singular Spectrum Analysis-Gated Recurrent Unit) model, this study aims to deeply explore characteristics of English learning behavior to provide a scientific basis for teaching optimization. Firstly, a comprehensive learning behavior database is constructed by collecting online learning data of English learners, including learning time, interaction frequency, and homework completion. Subsequently, the SSA-GRU model is used to mine the data deeply, and the potential laws and trends in learning behavior are effectively extracted. The experimental results show that compared with traditional analysis methods, the SSA-GRU model improves the accuracy of behavioral pattern recognition by 15.3% and trend prediction by 12.7%. Further analysis shows that learners’ learning time is positively correlated with their achievements (the correlation coefficient is 0.78), and the influence of interaction frequency on the learning effect is particularly significant (the improvement effect is 18.4%). This study proposes targeted teaching optimization strategies based on these analysis results, including personalized learning path recommendations and interactive teaching activity design. Practical application shows that these strategies have effectively improved the teaching effect, with students’ achievement increasing by 10.2% on average and learning satisfaction rising by 22.5%. This study not only enriches the theory of intelligent education but also provides strong support for English teaching practice, showing the broad application prospect of the SSA-GRU model in English learning behavior analysis and teaching optimization.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the imbalance between urban and rural spatial distribution and resource allocation has become increasingly prominent. National political forces play a key role in regulating this contradiction. This study aims to explore how national political forces affect the spatial distribution and resource allocation of urban and rural areas through policy intervention. The research background covers the complexity of urban and rural development under globalization and the guiding role of national policies in regional development. By constructing a comprehensive analysis model, it is found that the adjustment coefficient of national policies on urban and rural population distribution reaches 0.75, which significantly promotes the urbanization process. Regarding resource allocation, policy intervention has narrowed the difference in resource allocation between urban and rural areas by 20%, effectively alleviating the problem of resource inequality. In addition, the regional development pattern optimization index has increased by 30% under the guidance of policies, indicating the important role of national political forces in optimizing spatial structure and promoting the integrated development of urban and rural areas. The results of this study not only reveal the regulation mechanism of national political forces in urban and rural development and provide a scientific basis for future policy formulation, emphasizing the core position of the state in promoting the coordinated development of urban and rural areas.},

  abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, Power Marketing Management Platforms (PMMPs) have emerged as essential tools for businesses seeking to optimize their marketing strategies. These platforms integrate advanced technologies and data analytics to deliver targeted campaigns, automate processes, and generate valuable insights into customer behavior. However, traditional marketing approaches often face challenges such as data silos, poor cross-channel integration, and a limited ability to adapt to shifting consumer behaviors. This research investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance electricity consumption analysis and user engagement within PMMPs. A comprehensive framework is proposed, incorporating advanced analytical models for user segmentation, behavioral analysis, and consumption forecasting. The K-Means clustering algorithm segments users based on their electricity consumption patterns, enabling a more tailored service approach. To analyze temporal shifts in user behavior and forecast consumption trends, this research introduces the Dynamic Random Synthesized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (DR-LightGBM). This model delivers actionable insights that support grid scheduling and resource optimization. The system develops personalized marketing strategies, such as dynamic pricing models and energy-saving incentives, to enhance user participation and promote energy conservation. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated using several performance metrics. RMSE (38.11 kW), along with MAPE, MAE, and training time, assess the accuracy of consumption forecasting, while engagement rate and reduction in energy usage serve as business-relevant indicators of marketing impact. The experimental results highlight the significant potential of machine learning-driven approaches to improve user experience and operational efficiency in modern PMMPs.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of IoT technology, the nonlinear IoT environment has increasing requirements for the intelligence and resource efficiency of embedded systems. Based on the current background of Internet of Things technology, this study focuses on the design and optimization strategy of intelligent prediction and control algorithms for embedded systems under resource constraints. The proposed algorithm innovatively integrates the long short-term memory network (LSTM) of deep learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO) of reinforcement learning, LSTM processes long-term dependencies in IoT time series data, accurately captures the dynamic changes of the system, and the PPO helps the agent to optimize the control strategy in real time according to the environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, a comprehensive optimization framework combining computing efficiency improvement, storage optimization and energy management is proposed to achieve the best matching of algorithm performance and hardware resources. Experimental data shows that the optimized algorithm performs well in handling nonlinear data prediction tasks, reducing the average computation time by 37%, reducing storage requirements by more than 60%, and reducing energy consumption by 45%. Especially in the nonlinear temperature prediction experiment, the optimization algorithm maintains the same prediction accuracy as the original version, and the response speed is faster and the anti-interference ability is stronger in the face of data peaks, which fully demonstrates the advantages of the algorithm optimization. Compared with the existing methods, the new algorithm overcomes the difficulty of traditional algorithms in dealing with the nonlinear and high-dimensional problems of IoT data in terms of prediction accuracy, and greatly reduces the error. In terms of control performance, it breaks through the limitations of fixed strategies and maintains the efficient and stable operation of the system. It is also highly adaptable and robust. This research fills the gap in the design of intelligent algorithms for embedded systems in the nonlinear Internet of Things environment, and provides strong technical support for enterprises and research institutions to develop the next generation of Internet of Things applications.},

To address this, this study proposes a 3D human animation and motion data generation model that integrates mean shift clustering, graph structure neural network modeling, and Kalman filter prediction. This method achieves adaptive extraction of key bone points through dual-ring neighborhood density clustering, combines local geometry and poses semantics to construct a complete skeleton topology, and introduces a state recursive mechanism for missing point repair and temporal smoothing in the output stage. The experiment showed that the model achieved the highest F1 values of 94.83% and 93.94% on the Human 3.6 M dataset and the Carnegie Mellon University motion capture dataset, with a skeleton point missing rate as low as 6.21%. It maintained an average opinion score of up to 4.78 under multi-view and complex lighting conditions, with an average processing delay of no more than 34 ms. In terms of reconstruction accuracy, acceleration smoothness, and output integrity under extreme poses, this model outperformed other comparison models.

Based on the cuckoo algorithm, this study introduces adaptive step size adjustment, bird egg dynamic discovery strategy, and flight reconstruction strategy to optimize the search accuracy and global convergence ability of distribution paths. Finally, a new logistics distribution operation path mechanism is proposed.

This method introduces a safety-aware potential field and a composite reward mechanism to guide the agent to achieve a dynamic balance between path length and safety. In the experimental section, a dataset incorporating map and urban public safety information was constructed, and 800 rounds of path learning simulation experiments were conducted. The results show that the convergence time of the proposed algorithm is 32% shorter than that of the greedy strategy-based method and 27% shorter than that of the policy enhancement method. Additionally, the average path length is reduced by over 100 m, and the safety score improves by over 14%. In multi-destination travel tests, when the number of target points was 20, the total path length was reduced by 3.00% compared to the distance matrix method and by 0.15% compared to the genetic algorithm, verifying its scalability and stability in complex scenarios.

Based on the theory of nonlinear structural equation model, with the help of SPSS26.0 and AMOS21.0 software, this paper makes an empirical analysis on the financial data of China’s large-scale mechanical equipment and instrumentation manufacturing industry in 2023. Firstly, the structural equation model is constructed by drawing the path diagram of nonlinear structural equation. Secondly, the model is tested, and finally relevant conclusions are drawn. The empirical results show that the company’s cash payment ability, cash acquisition ability and cash turnover ability are positively correlated with the company’s value. Therefore, enterprises should closely link cash flow management with enterprise value creation, and enhance enterprise value through scientific and effective cash flow management, so as to realize the financial management goal of maximizing enterprise value.},

  abstract = {The banking system is composed of a large number of financial institutions closely connected through various transactions and relationships, forming a complex network that is prone to risk contagion. At the same time, financial markets are influenced by factors such as market volatility, economic cycles, and unpredictable external shocks, further increasing the complexity of systematic risk modeling and prediction. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity of systemic risk in banks, this study proposes an assessment method for systemic risk in banks based on stochastic differential equations. The results showed that compared with other methods, the model fitting and prediction accuracy of assessing systemic risk in banks based on stochastic differential equations were the highest. When the number of experiments was 1,000, the model fitting degree and prediction accuracy were 0.991 and 96.3%, respectively. The extreme event capture rate and risk premium correlation of evaluating experimental data samples from 30 listed banks using a stochastic differential equation model have been improved. When the number of experiments was 1,000, the extreme event capture rate and risk premium correlation using the SDE model were 93.3% and 0.85. The proposed bank systematic risk assessment method based on stochastic differential equations has superior performance. In real-world banking scenarios, this method captures the dynamic behavior and randomness of the banking system, enabling real-time monitoring and early warning of systemic risks, improving risk management efficiency, and ensuring financial market stability.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the scale of Internet information infrastructure has expanded rapidly, and its threat assessment is becoming more and more important. Assessing the threat of Internet information infrastructure can find out the most vulnerable link in the network node and provide a reference for taking correct network security defense measures. In view of the low accuracy of current Internet information infrastructure threat assessment methods, the study combined relevant data on Internet information infrastructure and constructed a knowledge graph of basic Internet information. This study proposes an Internet infrastructure threat assessment model based on knowledge atlas. In the effectiveness analysis of the model, the most vulnerable network node was Dom5, and it was found that the vulnerability of this node was affected by Dom1, Dom2, Dom3, Dom4, Dom7, and Dom8. Subsequently, in the analysis of the application effect of the model, the average F1 value and average recall rate of the model were 96.13% and 97.26%, respectively, which were better than the comparative model. The results show that the model is effective and has practical application value. This model not only has a high accuracy rate and recall rate in identifying vulnerable nodes but also provides valuable insights for network security defense strategies. This model accurately locates vulnerable nodes, analyzes their vulnerability impacts, and takes proactive measures to enhance network security.},

By establishing an aesthetic evaluation system for main road slopes, the research analyzes factors influencing visual landscape quality—including plant configuration, geological conditions, and cultural context—and investigates their correlation with landscape art assessment. Treating mountain slopes as windows for urban civilization, cultural carriers, and ecological nodes, the study addresses the challenge of transforming municipal engineering slopes into symbols of urban humanity. The research integrates 200+ domestic and international literatures, field surveys of 15 main road slopes (over 2 km) in Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming, questionnaires from 300 road users and 50 designers, and 10+ local policy documents. Slopes were selected for geological representativeness, visibility (≤50 m from roads), safety (slope &lt;60°), and diversity (soil/rock types). Empirical analysis includes: (1) status assessment (recording 35% slope data, diagnosing 40% soil erosion and 30% vegetation degradation); (2) evaluation system construction (12 indicators via AHP, with 25% weight for color richness and 30% for morphological diversity); (3) design optimization (30+ plant species for color-seasonal coordination, boosting vegetation coverage to &gt;80% through engineering-biological measures); and (4) effect monitoring (40% coverage increase and 30% erosion reduction within 6 months, with feedback-driven refinements). Findings show that the aesthetic-ecological design model balances visual appeal (e.g., seasonal color gradients) with ecological resilience (e.g., native vine soil fixation), validated by AHP-weighted morphological diversity as the primary aesthetic driver. The study provides a scientific framework for mountainous city slope landscaping, demonstrating its potential to reconcile urban development with environmental sustainability and offering a replicable model for similar regions.},

This study focuses on using CNN models to solve the problem of feature extraction and modeling in economic management big data, and explores its application value and contribution in this field. The CNN model, with its powerful ability to automatically extract features and capture local correlations in data, can break through the bottleneck of traditional methods in processing high-dimensional and nonlinear economic data. By preprocessing economic big data and applying CNN models, key features from multi-source heterogeneous data such as tax data and market transaction data can be efficiently extracted, avoiding the subjectivity and limitations of manual feature extraction. Through statistical analysis, these characteristics not only reveal the significant differences between China’s population and social economy in the eastern and western regions, but also show the overall trend of the economic development of cities and regions through time and space analysis. The application of CNN models provides a new technological path for economic data analysis, which helps to improve the accuracy of economic forecasting, optimize economic management decisions, and is of great significance for promoting the development of research and practice in the economic field.},

  abstract = {Traditional object repair methods usually rely on complex algorithms and a lot of manual labor, making it difficult to repair large and complex objects. In order to improve the efficiency of repairing large and complex targets and reduce the workload of object repair, an object repair model based on digital twin technology is developed. A charge-coupled device in the mechanical arm collects image data from the target object and transfers it to the real-virtual coordinate matching module. The attention mechanism is introduced to construct a multiscale residual UNet object image segmentation model for real-virtual coordinate matching to deal with the object repair trajectory planning problem. When verifying the function of the model, the loss degree, repair model parameters, and object repair error are used as evaluation indicators. The results of the model performance test revealed that the proposed multiscale residual UNet model for object image segmentation exhibited an accuracy of 0.942 while maintaining a loss value of 0.099 at steady state. Compared to the traditional UNet model, the study’s model had fewer parameters by 20.02 million and a slightly improved prediction accuracy of 0.01 on the self-built dataset. Additionally, the inclusion of the attention module enhanced the prediction accuracy by 0.02 M without adding too many parameters. The experiment demonstrated that the deviation between the predicted and actual object center coordinates was less than 1 mm, both horizontally and vertically. This sub-millimeter accuracy allowed for precise virtual-to-real alignment, which was essential for the operation of high-fidelity digital twins. It also ensured reliable robotic manipulation in demanding applications, such as precision component repair and cultural heritage restoration. Furthermore, the use of a dual-robot cooperative approach proved more effective. It was more effective in completing complex repair tasks. It increased system repair capability. It enabled omni-directional repairs previously unattainable with a single robot arm. Crucially, this dual-robot strategy reduced the time required for complex object repair to under 15 s. This represented a 40% improvement in speed over single-robot operation, while maintaining a repair pass rate of 99.2%.},

However, traditional methods are often inefficient and lack robustness in complex visual environments. This study proposes an improved product target information localization model, which takes a dense connection module as the backbone to extract multi-scale feature information. Then, a dynamic convolution module is employed to adaptively fuse responses from different convolution kernels, while an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance key regions. Finally, a multi-stage feature refinement module is applied to progressively optimize edge and structural information, thereby generating high-quality saliency maps and improving localization accuracy and model robustness. Compared with the baseline model without refinement, introducing three feature refinement modules increases the F-measure by 0.026, while dynamic convolution achieves an optimal F-measure of 0.951. Moreover, the combination of two feature refinement modules and dynamic convolution reduces the MAE by 0.018. Compared with four state-of-the-art models (Capsal, PiCANet, PoolNet, and DGRL), I-PFPN consistently outperforms them in F-measure and PR curve evaluations. In practice, the model completes product target localization within approximately 0.5 s per image, making it a fast and effective tool for enterprise-level applications in dynamic market environments.},

However, the structural optimization design and construction scheduling optimization of prefabricated building concrete components urgently need to be solved to meet the sustainable development. Therefore, the research adopts the dragonfly algorithm optimized by multiple strategies to optimize the overall structure of prefabricated concrete components in buildings. BIM technology is applied to build a construction scheduling optimization model that satisfies resource constraints and structural constraints to optimize the scheduling plan of prefabricated components during assembly construction and find the shortest construction period and optimal scheduling plan. The experimental results show that in the comparison of intelligent algorithm iteration curves, the improved algorithm was superior to the standard DA, Nelder-Mead, NS-FPA, and CPSO algorithms. In the multi-modal function test, the optimal result of the research model was 17.54, while the standard DA, Nelder-Mead, NS-FPA, and LMA algorithms were 72.5, 52.5, and 20.3, respectively. The convergence and optimization performance of the research model were both the best. In the specific construction optimization, the improved algorithm effectively reduced the cost of concrete components and increased the ultimate bearing capacity of welded joints by 6.24%. The construction scheduling optimization model based on BIM technology saved 0.2631 working days, or 6.31 h, improving the work efficiency and reducing cost.

By consolidating and analyzing data from Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, and Behance, this study examines 500,000 art-related posts over a 12-month period to identify key dissemination patterns and viral dynamics. The methodological framework utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks for extracting visual features and graph-based approaches for modeling diffusion dynamics, supplemented by advanced visualization techniques to explain complex dynamics of dissemination. Findings reveal that the spread of artistic content follows certain temporal and spatial dynamics, with the visual appeal of an artwork, posting times, and network effects constituting key drivers of virality. The visualization framework utilized integrates interactive network graphs, temporal heat maps, and multi-dimensional scaling to represent dissemination pathways, thus enabling real-time tracking and pattern detection. The predictive models achieve an accuracy level of 87.3% in predicting the viral potential, reflecting a significant performance boost compared to conventional baseline techniques. This study offers novel insights into digital art consumption, provides actionable suggestions for artists and cultural institutions, and establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding the diffusion of creative content in interconnected systems.

  abstract = {Under the dual backdrop of the innovation-driven development strategy and the coordinated development of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, the growth of county-level technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Hebei Province has been constrained by regional heterogeneity in resource endowments and industrial foundations, which conflicts with the uniform application of support policies. Accurately identifying spatial differentiation patterns in policy effectiveness has become essential for optimizing policy implementation. Existing studies have primarily employed traditional models such as ordinary least squares (OLS), overlooking the spatial correlation of county-level economic systems. Moreover, limited attention has been paid to the local spatial heterogeneity of policy variables and enterprise development indicators, the nonlinear characteristics of policy effects at the county scale, and the quantification of spatial spillover effects of support policies. To address these limitations, moderation models, threshold regression models, and the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) were integrated in this study to construct a moderating effect measurement model of support policies. Through this approach, the spatially differentiated effects of support policies for technology-based SMEs across counties in Hebei Province were quantified. The nonlinear moderating mechanisms of policy instruments and their spatial transmission patterns were systematically examined. By integrating spatial econometric techniques with policy effect evaluation frameworks, this study proposes a novel paradigm for regional policy research and offers evidence-based guidance for designing differentiated policy measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of support initiatives in Hebei Province.},

  abstract = {With the increasing demand for analyzing accuracy and real-time performance in soccer games, traditional athlete tracking algorithms are challenged to perform in complex scenes. The main objective of the research is to cope with the challenges such as occlusion and lighting changes in complex scenes by improving the detection speed and accuracy. To this end, a novel soccer player tracking detection model is investigated. First, channel pruning and layer pruning techniques are used to optimize YOLOv3, which reduces the computational complexity and the number of parameters, while ensuring high detection accuracy. Second, the feature enhancement module and offset sampling mechanism are designed in combination with the improved DeepSORT multi-target tracking algorithm. By combining the Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm, the accuracy of target prediction and trajectory association is further improved. The experiment outcomes show that on the publicly available football network version 2 dataset, the F1 value of the model reaches 94.56%, and the average processing time is only 0.74 s. On the football player tracking and recognition dataset, the F1 value of the model is 95.27% and the processing time is 0.77 s. In addition, the loss rate is the lowest in occluded scenes, at 8.34%, and the highest trajectory consistency reaches 92.59% in lighting changing environments. From this, the model proposed by the research is significantly superior to existing methods in multiple key performance indicators, and has excellent detection capabilities and practical application potential. It can provide certain technical support for the analysis of penalty decisions and technical guidance in future football matches.},

  abstract = {The study focuses on enhancing the accuracy of numerical solutions for Euler’s equations, essential for aerospace, engineering, and scientific simulations. To improve the numerical solution accuracy and efficiency of nonlinear problems, this study proposes a high-precision and high stability scheme for the Euler equation system, combining the fifth-order explicit weighted compact nonlinear scheme with the third-order semi-implicit implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method. The results show that the scheme maintains design order accuracy in both high and low Mach number flows, with a spatial discretization error of 4.95 orders and a time discretization error convergence order of 5.86 orders. The width of the shock transition zone is reduced by 40% compared to traditional weighted compact nonlinear scheme. This demonstrates the accuracy advantage of this format. And this format remains stable even when Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy&gt;1, making it suitable for large-scale industrial simulation, which is beneficial for improving efficiency. In one-dimensional shock tubes, bimodal acoustic pulse collisions, and Lax/Sod problems, the density, velocity, and pressure results of this format are consistent with the reference solution, with no oscillation phenomenon. The rigid processing error of the pressure term is less than 1.134 × 10

Building on the recent work of Singh, Sharma, and Kumar—which introduced a self-accelerating parameter dependent on the last iterate—an in-depth stability analysis of these without memory methods in a vectorial framework is proposed. The main objective is to evaluate how parameters’ selection and variation affect the process’s convergence and stability using tools from discrete dynamical systems, bifurcation diagrams, and dynamical planes. The results demonstrate that certain members of the family, particularly those with fourth-order convergence, exhibit superior stability properties compared to the initially proposed fifth-order scheme. Additionally, numerical tests on various nonlinear systems confirm the theoretical stability results. The stable methods of these families can be successfully applied on realistic problems such as preliminary orbit determination and on the nonlinear systems resulting from the discretization of Fisher’s equation used in population genetics and ecology, convection-diffusion equations appearing in engineering problems, etc.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene is often used as the outer protective layer of optical cables due to its excellent dielectric, corrosion resistance, and mechanical properties. However, when facing high-voltage optical cable lines, its insulation ability is slightly insufficient. Therefore, a new type of optical cable sheath has been studied and prepared. This sheath is suitable for optical cable systems with voltage levels of 10 kV and below, and can meet the insulation and protection requirements in power communication scenarios. Firstly, different forms of magnesium oxide were prepared by hydrothermal and redox methods, and added to a polyethylene solution. The magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film was prepared by a solution casting process with thermal crosslinking at 180°C for 15 min. To further improve the performance of composite films, a new type of optical cable sheath material, magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film, was prepared by combining high thermal conductivity alumina with fibrous magnesium oxide/polyethylene. The results showed that when the amount of fibrous magnesium oxide in different forms of magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite films was 1.5 phr, the breakdown strength could reach 468 kV/mm, which was 26.49% higher than that of pure polyethylene, and the dielectric capacity increased by 5%. The direct current breakdown strength of the alumina/magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film was 518 kV/mm, which was 14.11% higher than that of the magnesium oxide/polyethylene composite film. The above data indicated that the insulation performance of the modified optical cable sheath was greatly improved, which can adapt to higher voltage optical cable protection. The research provides important references for the design and optimization of new optical cable sheath materials, as well as new ideas and methods for material research in related application fields.},

Good physical fitness is an essential foundation for the police to perform tasks and an important way to improve and apply police techniques and tactics. As the management of police physical training is a complex process, it is a qualitative concept with “fuzziness,” and it is impossible to accurately and ideally describe its content quantitatively only by classical and random mathematics. To carry out scientific quantitative analysis and objective evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages and to promote the development of police physical training and comprehensively improve the level of police physical fitness. This paper studies the application effect of four kinds of Fuzzy (Fuzzy mathematics) calculation methods in the management evaluation of police physical training by combining the fuzzy formula method with a questionnaire survey. The study results show that using four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) scoring methods can determine the quality level of any police physical training management and rank the comprehensive scores from high too low to distinguish the ranking order clearly. The four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) scoring methods are both scientific and reasonable: (reliability), and is simple and easy to implement (validity). Especially in sports research, quantitative evaluation of people or things in a “fuzzy state” is worthy of praise for development and application. Finally, we concluded that the four Fuzzy (fuzzy mathematics) calculation methods have good feasibility and operability.},

Firstly, we improve the PSO and adaptively adjust the inertia weight to facilitate the particle search. Besides, we disturb the particles with the chaotic variables to increase the convergence speed. Secondly, the pheromone distribution on the path is adjusted based on the optimal solution of PSO to solve the initial pheromone insufficiency issue in the ACO algorithm. Then, to optimize the update strategy, we adaptively adjust the pheromone intensity values. We also provide a wide range of control schemes for updating the parameters for balancing the search capability and convergence. The results in the simulation environment show that our algorithm is more effective than other improved algorithms. The improved fusion algorithm converges faster and finds shorter optimal path.

These risks pose significant threats to the security of the power networks. However, the existing methods still have some problems, such as incomplete risk awareness indicators and inaccurate identification of power grid operational state. To ensure the secure and stable operation of an urban power grid, a risk situational awareness model for the resilient distribution network cyber-physical system (CPS) based on data density is developed, along with an enhanced Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting (N-HiTS). Firstly, a more comprehensive risk situation index system is proposed to reflect the characteristics of power grid security situation and provide assessment basis for situation understanding and prediction. Second, the data density is used to determine the typical state of each node in order to distinguish between risk and normal states. Thirdly, a neural hierarchical interpolation algorithm with enhanced predictive capabilities is presented for forecasting future operational characteristics. Finally, a neural random network is used to classify the future states of nodes, and the part that does not belong to the typical state is identified as the risk state, so as to realize the risk situational awareness. The model is validated using actual data from a regional distribution network in East China. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves an identification rate exceeding 95% for all types of risks, and both the index system and the model can improve the situational awareness accuracy of each node by about 2%. Therefore, the proposed method can perceive the future risk posture of CPS nodes in the distribution network and have higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract = {At present, for ecological efficiency evaluation, the traditional data envelopment analysis has the problem that the same model is difficult to take into account different proportions of economic and environmental efficiency analysis. This study innovatively proposes a dual-objective data envelopment analysis (DEA) ecological efficiency model that combines environmental efficiency and economic efficiency. This method is based on data inclusion analysis and addresses the limitations of traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) in balancing economic and environmental efficiency ratios. The results showed that, compared to traditional methods, the new method considered cities with lower ecological efficiency more comprehensively. This was because it incorporated unexpected outputs, such as carbon emissions, and dynamic weight allocation. The provincial ENE was about 0.55 (new method), lower than the traditional data envelopment analysis’s 0.6, reflecting a more rigorous assessment of the model’s environmental impact. The environmental efficiency of a province was about 0.55, while the environmental efficiency of cities in the eastern, central, and western regions was about 0.75, 0.42, and 0.42, respectively. The environmental efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.35 and 0.73, respectively. The economic efficiency of the whole province was around 0.97, and the economic efficiency of the cities in the east, center, and west regions was around 0.99, 0.98, and 0.95, respectively, which were all higher than 0.95 and above. It demonstrated that the economic efficiency of the cities in the east, center and west regions was higher. The economic efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.965 and 0.995, respectively, and the economic efficiency of the province was higher at around 0.977.

The ecological efficiency of cities in the north and south regions was around 0.38 and 0.73, respectively. From 2020 to 2024, the changes in ecological efficiency in the province were more stable. The economic efficiency of all cities in the period from 2018 to 2020 was generally high, and some cities even reached a perfect score.

  abstract = {The need for player emotion in game product design and operation is growing in relevance given the explosive growth of the game sector. As a mainstream competitive genre, MOBA games involve regular player interactions and strong emotional fluctuations that quickly call for effective emotion tendency research techniques to improve user experience and product tuning impacts. In this study, we build an emotional model framework based on enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and propose a model entitled MOBA-SentDRL for MOBA environment. The results reveal that MOBA-SentDRL beats the conventional model in several criteria by building an actual MOBA game user sentiment dataset and assessing it in a range of comparison studies. The work motivates the future direction of multimodal and multi-strategy fusion for emotional computing and offers a practical method for the emotion interpretation and interaction of intelligent gaming goods.},

  abstract = {A robust video processing technology that integrates adaptive Kalman filtering and optimized ORB algorithm is proposed to address the problems of image blur and feature matching failure caused by mechanical vibration and extreme lighting changes in industrial video surveillance. By dynamically adjusting the covariance matrix of KF process noise, the synergistic suppression of high-frequency vibration and pulse type illumination noise can be achieved. The experimental results show that optimizing the ORB algorithm enhances the invariance of feature point direction and scale through the Gaussian difference pyramid and grayscale centroid method, and the success rate of feature point matching is improved by 63.1% compared to the traditional method. In extreme lighting changes and dynamic scenes, the algorithm reduces image pixel offset by 56%–67% and increases peak signal-to-noise ratio by an average of 32%–34%, significantly better than mainstream methods such as histogram equalization and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization. By simplifying the calculation process of ORB feature descriptors, the algorithm’s processing speed increases by 57% compared to the traditional SIFT method, meeting the timeliness requirements of industrial monitoring. In four typical industrial scenarios, the pixel matching accuracy reaches 85.23%, 78.34%, and 83.56% in rotation, scale, and lighting variation scenarios. Compared with gyroscope technology and traditional ORB algorithm, the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed method is improved by an average of 2.56 dB and 1.67 dB, respectively. The above results indicate that the proposed method has better image denoising and robustness effects in real industrial environments than traditional video image processing techniques and is of great significance for maintaining the clarity of video surveillance images in harsh industrial environments.},

  abstract = {As music gradually becomes an indispensable part of people’s lives, the optimization of music recommendation systems has become a research hotspot. In response to the problems of poor recommendation accuracy and low degree of personalization in music recommendation systems, this article combined the optimized LGCN-A (Light Graph Convolution Network-Attitude) algorithm to conduct personalized modeling and recommendation research in music recommendation systems. Firstly, the collected data is cleaned and normalized, and feature data of users and music are extracted. Then, a graph structure between users and music is constructed, and each user and music node is initialized with a feature vector operation. The original feature vectors of users and music can be mapped to the embedding space through linear transformation, and the embedding vector can be initialized using Gaussian distribution and regularized. Finally, based on the traditional NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering) algorithm, lightweight processing can be achieved by reducing nonlinear activation functions and feature transformation steps, and self-attention mechanism can be introduced to assign different weights to different users and music. The experiment is based on the public dataset Million Song Dataset to predict the interaction between users and music, and generate a recommendation list. The results show that at k of 20, the recommendation hit rate of the LGCN-A algorithm reached 0.95, which is 0.19 higher than the traditional NGCF algorithm, and the overlap is only 21.43%. The LGCN-A algorithm has improved the accuracy of recommendations in music recommendation systems, ensuring different levels of user personalization and providing strong support for the further development of recommendation systems.},

Despite the significance of remuneration, many firms find it difficult to put in place structures that are fair and accommodating of the diverse workforce. This study suggests a thorough, data-driven approach for segmenting data using adaptive clustering in order to maximize employee remuneration. The paradigm allows for accurate and comprehensible employee stratification by including new indicators like the wage-to-Performance Ratio (SPR), wage growth rate, and satisfaction elasticity. A real-world corporate dataset was used, and to guarantee data quality, extensive preparation was done, including feature engineering, normalization, and outlier elimination. Different employee segments were created using adaptive clustering, which was assessed against conventional K-Means and directed by internal validation indices (such as the elbow method and silhouette score). Strategic pay changes are informed by empirical evaluation’s actionable findings, which include identifying strong achievers who are underpaid and long-tenured employees who are stagnant. HR professionals may identify high-potential employee cohorts and adopt data-driven, performance-aligned remuneration plans with the help of the suggested strategy. Additionally, the approach supports evidence-based human capital management in a variety of operational situations by exhibiting scalability and flexibility across different organizational structures.},

  abstract = {Education is vital for talent development, and assessing English teaching quality helps teachers improve their methods. However, traditional assessment models are inefficient and time-consuming. To address this, this study proposes a new teaching quality assessment model using a forward rule fast-matching algorithm. This approach improves data processing efficiency by removing irrelevant data through a rule-driven data cleaning. The model integrates a deep belief network with the fast-matching algorithm to create an effective evaluation tool, along with a student performance prediction model. Finally, for model validation, the study used a self-collected dataset that included English performance data from 286 students, which was later expanded to include English performance data from 3500 students from 10 universities of different sizes. Experimental results show that the model performs well, achieving a PR curve area of 0.87 and an F1 value of 0.93. After regularization, the model reduced time consumption by 6.18% and space usage by 3.23%. The average matching time was 319 ms, with 927 matches on average—both better than existing methods. Moreover, the difference between actual and predicted English scores was small, with detection accuracy above 93%. In conclusion, the proposed model offers higher efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in evaluating English teaching quality. The research contributes by reducing time costs and improving evaluation effectiveness, offering a practical solution for real-world teaching assessments.

Traditional research faces huge challenges in resource optimization and dynamic decision-making. Therefore, this paper first abstracts the intelligent management problem of ecological agriculture as a multi-agent sequential decision-making problem. Then, the cosine function is adopted to improve the Transformer model (EOTransformer). For the entire agricultural production supply chain involved in the cooperation, maintain the encoder and decoder structure of EOTransformer. At each time step, agent observations are encoded by passing them through the encoder to obtain their latent representations. The decoder generates optimal actions of each agent through sequential autoregression to obtain the best strategy. Experimental outcome demonstrates that the suggested approach achieves an approximate 90% reduction in parameter scale over standard approach, greatly reducing the complexity of the algorithm.},

Personalized recommendations on online shopping platforms directly promote the growth of e-commerce sales by improving user experience and satisfaction; at the same time, through the application of intelligent recommendation technology, it accelerates the technological innovation of the e-commerce industry and the changes in the competitive landscape. However, current personalized recommendation algorithms still have problems such as poor algorithm performance, long iteration time, and low recommendation precision. To better achieve personalized recommendations for online shopping, this article applies deep Q-network (DQN) to explore personalized recommendation algorithms in depth. In the article, data is first collected and preprocessed through data augmentation, and based on the deep Q-network, a user–product interaction matrix is constructed. Afterward, based on user behavior characteristic data, user behavior modeling is implemented. Then a DQN-based learning architecture is constructed by combining long-term interests, short-term interests, and prediction modules, and a small batch gradient descent method is used to train the function. Finally, this article evaluates the performance of the algorithm. The research results show that when the length of the recommendation list is 1, the accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of the DQN algorithm are 0.924, 0.875, and 0.901, respectively. The recommendation algorithm based on DQN achieves good results in indicators of recommendation accuracy, recall, and mean average precision. In this article, DQN is applied, and the online shopping recommendation system is optimized by combining deep learning and reinforcement learning, significantly improving the quality and efficiency of recommendations and promoting the intelligent development of the e-commerce industry.},

  abstract = {Throughout the existing literature, the research on the legislative view of artificial intelligence is mainly divided into two modes: policy-driven and market economy-driven; and this paper is based on the legal interpretation theory and analysis method. The above two models of artificial intelligence legislation are analyzed. The policy-driven view of AI legislation is based on the power-based approach, focusing on the national security issues involved in the development of the AI industry, as well as ex post-facto remedies for criminal offenses. The market economy-driven AI legislation model is based on the rights-based approach, focusing on the ex-ante prevention of civil infringement and moral and ethical issues involved in the development of the AI industry. This paper argues that AI legislation should integrate the “hard law path” and the “soft law path,” and comprehensively consider the factors of “legality” and “legitimacy.”},

  abstract = {In graphic design, designers often need to consider multiple goals, such as the esthetics of the design, the accuracy of conveying information, and the visual experience of the user. Multi-objective collaborative optimization can help designers find the best balance point between multiple objectives and improve the quality and effectiveness of their designs. Therefore, research proposed a graphic design method that combines user label preference information with multi-objective optimization, which combines user preference information with PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm for multi-objective optimization. The findings showed that when the number of training samples was small, the contour coefficients of each model changed significantly, and the clustering effect of the models was unstable. As the amount of training samples increased, the clustering effect of each model tended to stabilize. The contour coefficients based on improved K-means, K-means++, and classical K-means algorithms were 0.743, 0.707, and 0.546, respectively, indicating that the improved K-means algorithm had the best clustering effect in this study. As the number of users increases, the user accuracy of the research method improves to 0.88. The recall rate of the research method is consistently higher than other comparative methods, at approximately 0.93. The proposed methods in graphic design can effectively integrate user preference information, meet the needs of graphic design, and provide reference for designers in graphic design.},

  abstract = {With the development of smart grids, short-term net load prediction for distributed energy is increasingly valued, net load prediction can fully explore the difference between electricity load and renewable energy output, and is the basis for energy management and optimal scheduling. Considering that the correlation between source and charge is not considered in the traditional statistical model, and the prediction accuracy is poor, this paper proposes a short-term net load prediction method for distributed energy based on the Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks (STGCNs) and Attention mechanism. First, the time series of factors such as wind power, solar power, historical characteristics of actual load, and weather environment in the integrated energy system are mapped into the data form of graph structure, and the correlation between variables is calculated using the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC). It is used as the weighted value of the connected edges of nodes to construct the adjacency matrix and initialize the graph network. Then, STGCN is used to autonomous feature extraction of the time series. STGCN can consider the uncertainties at both ends of the source and load at the same time, and fully extract the internal relationship between the source and load variables in the distributed energy graph network. Finally, the Attention mechanism is used to strengthen the feature extraction ability of STGCN model for time series data, improving the short-term net load prediction accuracy. The experiment uses the real power data set of an integrated energy system in a region for verification. Compared with other data-driven methods, the fusion model trained and generated has higher prediction accuracy. At the same time, the trained generated model can adapt to different scale data and different prediction lengths in practice, and has strong generalization ability.},

Their utility has since broadened to drag reduction in submarines, micro-coolers, biomedical flow control, and thermal reactors. This study computationally simulates and statistically analyzes the energy transfer efficiency of an electro-magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) Casson trihybrid nanofluid flowing past a vertical radiant Riga plate in scenarios involving natural and forced convection, considering the effects of viscous dissipation, suction, and the nanomaterials’ shape factor. The governing model is solved using a hybrid spectral technique, with numerical results validated against benchmark data. According to the results of the current work, suction augmentation diminishes the tri-hybrid Casson nanofluid’s velocity and drag forces. Elevating the values of mixed convection or Casson factors reduces the Casson tri-hybrid nanofluid’s temperature and enhances its energy transfer. The incorporation of non-spherical nanoparticles reduces the Nusselt number by 0.23%–5.3% and increases skin friction by 1.6%–14% in comparison to using spherical nanoparticles. Multiple regression indicates that thermal radiation is the most positive contributor in boosting energy transfer rates. These insights may advance predictive capabilities for thermal management in energy systems and guide next-generation EMHD reactor design.},

Green sustainable development has been extended to the service field and new technologies, new models, and new business forms of green service have been brought into being. Based on the original data of 213 service-oriented corporates, this paper adopts the questionnaire survey method to explore the mechanism between green service innovation carried out by service-oriented enterprises and consumer happiness based on the perspectives of consumers’ “value identity” and “extra-role altruistic behavior.” This study aims to solve the problem of how green service innovation provided by corporates translates into consumer happiness. The findings are as follows: Value identity has a mediating effect between corporate green service innovation and consumer extra-role altruistic behavior (beneficial to corporates and environment), and consumer extra-role altruistic behavior has a serial mediating effect between corporate green service innovation and consumer happiness. Resource heterogeneity positively moderates the relationship between corporate green service innovation and consumer value identity. Resource coupling also positively moderates the relationship between consumers’ value identity and their extra-role altruistic behavior. The conclusion extends the research boundary of enterprise green service innovation and adds a new perspective and context. Moreover, the research results also provide reference for the service innovation transformation of related corporates.},

Unlike conventional machine learning (ML), which demands substantial processing power, TinyML strategically delegates processing requirements to the cloud infrastructure, allowing lightweight models to run on embedded devices. This study aimed to (i) Develop a TinyML workflow that details the steps for model creation and deployment in resource-constrained environments and (ii) apply the workflow to e-health applications for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The methodology employs a dataset of 4097 EEG recordings per patient, each 23.5 seconds long, from 500 patients, to develop a robust and resilient model. The model was deployed using TinyML on microcontrollers tailored to hardware with limited resources. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) efficiently runs ML models on small devices, such wearables. Simulation outcomes demonstrated significant performance, particularly in predicting epileptic seizures, with the ExtraTrees Classifier achieving a notable 99.6% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the validation set. Because of its superior performance, the ExtraTrees Classifier was selected as the preferred model. For the optimized TinyML model, the accuracy remained practically unchanged, whereas inference time was significantly reduced. Additionally, the converted model had a smaller size of 256 KB, approximately ten times smaller, making it suitable for microcontrollers with a capacity of no more than 1 MB.
          These findings highlight the potential of TinyML to significantly enhance healthcare applications by enabling real-time, energy-efficient decision-making directly on local devices. This is especially valuable in scenarios with limited computing resources or during emergencies, as it reduces latency, ensures privacy, and operates without reliance on cloud infrastructure. Moreover, by reducing the size of training datasets needed, TinyML helps lower overall costs and minimizes the risk of overfitting, making it an even more cost-effective and reliable solution for healthcare innovations.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of power load is one of the important research directions in demand response uncertainty. Accurate and effective power system load forecasting is an important prerequisite for ensuring the safety, stable operation, and normal production of the power grid. To improve the accuracy of short-term load forecasting in power systems under demand response scenarios, this paper proposes a Transformer load forecasting method that considers demand response potential. Firstly, the change law of response uncertainty with electricity price difference and consumer psychology principles are used to quantify the power demand response results under different probability conditions. Then, Transformer neural networks are used to extract features from user historical load, temperature, electricity price, and other time series data. Finally, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to pay attention to the structural relationship between time series data, analyze the importance of input variables at each historical moment on the current load, and achieve high-precision prediction of user load and demand response potential. This article takes industrial users as an example to predict the power load and demand response regulation power of the general component manufacturing industry. Through comparative analysis with actual data, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with other existing methods, the Transformer model that considers demand response performs well in power load forecasting, providing a certain theoretical basis for evaluating the potential of demand response. The subsequent work will study the characteristics of electric, hot, and cold loads and their coupling relationships under the difference of electricity prices, and improve the forecasting performance of user loads and Demand Response Regulation power, so as to reduce the power generation and operation costs of the grid.},

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated anemia, driven by erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency and iron dysregulation, significantly impacts patient survival and quality of life. Conventional therapies like erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) face limitations including injection dependency, cardiovascular risks, and iron intolerance. Vadadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), offers a novel mechanism by stabilizing HIF-α subunits to enhance endogenous EPO production, improve iron utilization, and promote erythropoiesis. Pharmacokinetically, Vadadustat exhibits rapid absorption (peak: 2–3 hours), dose-proportional exposure, minimal accumulation, and 99.5% plasma protein binding, with adjustments recommended in dialysis-dependent CKD due to reduced clearance. Phase III clinical trials demonstrate non-inferiority of Vadadustat versus Darbepoetin Alfa in maintaining target hemoglobin levels across dialysis-dependent (DD-CKD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD-CKD) populations. However, while Vadadustat met cardiovascular safety endpoints in DD-CKD (INNO2VATE trials), it showed a higher major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk in NDD-CKD (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01–1.36). Common adverse events include hypertension (14%), gastrointestinal disturbances (13%), and thrombosis. Drug interactions with oral iron, OAT3 inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol), and BCRP substrates require monitoring. Approved for adults with dialysis-dependent CKD (≥3 months duration), Vadadustat provides an effective oral alternative to ESAs, with potential advantages in iron mobilization and flexible thrice-weekly dosing. Future studies should address long-term cardiovascular safety in non-dialysis populations.},

  abstract = {The coupled lateral-torsional vibration of thin-walled beams under moving harmonic loads holds critical engineering relevance. For example, vehicles traversing uneven roads induce vertical oscillations that translate into harmonic excitations on thin-walled beams. Based on Vlasov’s thin-walled beam theory, this study establishes closed-form time-domain solutions for the lateral-torsional displacements of mono-symmetric thin-walled beams by transforming the coupled partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations via modal expansion, and solving them through Laplace transform and its inverse. A finite element solution program based on the Newmark-β algorithm is created for validation purposes, with verification results demonstrating close alignment between analytical and numerical solutions. A key innovation involves representing a single vehicle load as two eccentric lateral forces in parameter analysis, enhancing the accuracy of simulating vehicle-induced dynamics. Furthermore, parametric studies quantitatively characterize the effects of critical control parameters (excitation frequency, moving speed, span length, load eccentricity, and warping stiffness) on lateral-torsional coupling displacements. Key conclusions are that torsional displacement is more velocity-sensitive; warping suppresses peak amplitudes. These findings provide a profound foundation for designing thin-walled bridges to avoid resonance.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization and the rise of cultural industries, the planning and advancement of urban cultural industry has become an important research object. To study the advancement of urban cultural industry planning, this study proposes a comprehensive fuzzy algorithm research system. The methodology dynamically optimizes indicator weights through a fusion of static weights (determined via Analytic Hierarchy Process) and dynamic weights (derived from Euclidean distance-based similarity normalization). A multi-dimensional digital indicator system spanning digital factor investment, innovation environment, and industry competition is constructed, with competitiveness quantitatively assessed using entropy weighting. FP-Growth further mines implicit association rules among indicators to enhance correlation analysis. Experiments show that when the number of people involved is 400 thousand, the calculation time of the research method is 330 s, which is significantly improved compared with the performance of the comparison method which exceeds 900 s. In the runtime data volume test, the retained data volume generated by the research method in 500 s was only approximately 130M, which was much less than 310M and 220M of the comparison methods. During the data processing, the data error rate in the retained data tends to be stable and fluctuates between 2% and 3%. The research methods have obtained accurate and effective analysis results on the promotion of urban cultural industry planning in both types of countries. This indicates that the research method has good performance and practical application effects and can provide effective references for urban cultural industry planning.},

Traditional theoretical e-commerce construction cannot improve the efficiency of e-commerce construction. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to conduct in-depth research on countermeasures for e-commerce construction from the perspective of artificial intelligence algorithms. This article analyzes the problems in the construction of EC (which may refer to related systems such as e-commerce), and uses BP neural network to train the input and output layers, which can quickly identify environmental hazards, detect ecological hazards, and improve the quality of EC; Also utilizing it to identify and classify garbage, incorporating the network into input data learning and outputting categories; Implement non-linear mapping of input and output through BP neural network, transmit signals and predict future natural disasters. In addition, in addition to technical analysis, other countermeasures are proposed for EC construction issues in order to provide inspiration for e-commerce construction. After analyzing the BP neural network, this article conducts experimental comparisons on the recognition and classification accuracy of different types of garbage in e-commerce. The results showed that the BP neural network had recognition accuracy and classification accuracy of over 80% for recyclable waste, kitchen waste, and hazardous waste, with specific rates of 81.21%, 85.00%, 83.70%, and 81.51%, 83.29%, and 87.34%, respectively.

Learning management systems (LMSs) that are housed on the cloud, mobile applications for tailored language learning, chatbots driven by artificial intelligence for language practice, virtual reality technologies for language learning, and data analytics tools for tracking student progress are the five distinct possibilities that are presented at this time. On the basis of eight criteria, each alternative is given careful examination. These criteria are as follows: cost-effectiveness, flexibility, customization, security, integration, and scaling. A crucial component of the decision-making process is the CRITIC-AROMAN method, which functions inside a Fermatean fuzzy (FF) environment. Through an analysis of the relationships between the various criteria, CRITIC guarantees that a comprehensive assessment of the relevance of each criterion is carried out by accurately balancing them. Then, in order to measure the effectiveness of the alternatives, AROMAN employs ratio evaluations and ranks them according to how well they performed in comparison to these criteria. However, the FF environment offers a flexible framework for dealing with imprecise data, despite the fact that the decision-making process is riddled with ambiguity. In the end, these techniques make it possible to conduct an organized and comprehensive evaluation of the many IT-driven options that may be implemented in English as Second Language (ESL) classrooms. This, in turn, makes it possible to make informed decisions that are in accordance with the objectives and priorities of the institution.},

Additionally, the SIoU loss function is adopted for more precise bounding box regression. These enhancements collectively reduce model size to 4.1 MB and computational complexity to 9.3 GFlops while achieving a high mAP@0.5 of 96.7%. Compared to the original YOLOv8s, this model reduces complexity by 67.5% with improved detection accuracy and robustness under varied lighting and occlusion conditions, making it suitable for real-time applications on edge devices in agricultural robotics.},

The experimental group adopted the classroom interactive Chinese teaching mode based on IoT technology, and the control group adopted the traditional Chinese teaching mode. Before and after the experiment, the college students in the two groups were tested on their comprehensive language ability and questionnaire survey on their satisfaction with language learning, and at the same time, the college students in the experimental group were interviewed to collect their evaluations and feedbacks on the teaching mode. The experimental results show that the comprehensive language ability and language learning satisfaction of the college students in the experimental group are significantly higher than those in the control group, and both of them are significantly improved during the experimental period, which indicates that the teaching mode has a positive impact on college students' language learning. The results of the questionnaires and interviews also showed that the college students had a positive attitude toward the teaching mode, believing that it could make the language classroom more vivid and interesting, increase the interaction between teachers and students as well as among students, and improve the efficiency and quality of language learning.

Firstly, it conducts research on the intelligent perception trust model for Internet of Things nodes to ensure accurate calculation and evaluation of node trust, and to adapt to changes in the Internet of Things environment. Secondly, a trust transmission energy consumption intelligent perception model based on multi-agent nodes in the Internet of Things is constructed. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of trust transmission and control energy consumption, the concept of multi-agent is introduced and combined with energy consumption intelligent perception technology. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of the model decreases from the initial 0.56 to 0.24 with the change in the number of recombinations, a decrease of approximately 57%. As the number of cycles changes, it decreases from the initial 0.51 to 0.22, a decrease of approximately 57%. It is evident that it has significant advantages in energy consumption control. It can be seen that this study explores the differences in energy consumption control among different trust models, providing an important reference for subsequent model selection and optimization.},

The ACARMI algorithm (an improved algorithm of constrained association rule mining based on item) is then applied. Then, data from six top badminton competitions is collected and converted into Boolean data suitable for this algorithm. A data mining module is designed to mine the tactical association rules of all players, and a specific analysis is conducted on one of the players, successfully analyzing their tactical strategies. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this article, FP-Growth algorithm and DHP algorithm are applied to comparative experiments. The experiment shows that compared with the FP-Growth algorithm, the initial and final running times of the algorithm in this article with minimum support and different constraint numbers are around “355 ms and 75 ms,” “150 ms and 45 ms,” respectively; similarly, compared with the DHP algorithm, they are around “165 ms and 35 ms,” “175 ms and 55 ms,” respectively. Under two sets of experiments, the algorithm proposed in this article presents better operational efficiency.

  abstract = {Pulse repetition interval (PRI) selection significantly impacts the performance of modern radar systems. Although fixed PRI radar systems have made significant advancements, they face inherent challenges such as vulnerability to interference, deception, and high sidelobe levels. To mitigate these issues, random PRI radar systems have been developed, offering improved multitarget detection and enhanced anti-jamming capabilities. However, random PRI introduces complexity in sidelobe suppression, which is critical for maintaining radar system performance. This paper reviews sidelobe suppression techniques in random PRI radar, focusing on the Cyclic Algorithm-New (CAN) and various window functions, including Hanning, Hamming, Kaiser, and Chebyshev windows. By leveraging the CAN algorithm’s unique capability to optimize phase in the frequency domain, this study transfers the traditional trade-off between main lobe width and sidelobe suppression to edge effects. The results demonstrate that applying time-domain windowing to the time-domain sequence (which was optimized in the frequency domain via the CAN algorithm) significantly improves sidelobe suppression, with the Chebyshev window showing superior performance in high-precision scenarios. This work provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for enhancing radar system performance in complex electromagnetic environments.},

  abstract = {In the current context of information data sharing, with the rapid development of communication technology and intelligence, malicious program patch control technology has been widely applied. To address the issues of malicious program propagation control, this study uses the deep deterministic gradient algorithm to design a malicious program patch control method. On the basis of analyzing the propagation mechanism of malicious programs, intrusion detection systems are used to model the malicious programs. The rehabilitation model for susceptible infected individuals is applied to describe the process of malware transmission and construct a composite malware patch propagation model. A malicious program patch control method based on the dual deep Q-network algorithm is designed by introducing a composite malicious program patch propagation model. The dual deep Q-network algorithm could achieve network equilibrium in 45 time steps. Under the attack of malicious programs with different hit rates, the peak proportion of susceptible devices reached 0.07, 0.02, and 0.286, respectively. The number of devices infected by high hit rate malicious programs was 2.81 times that of devices infected by low hit rate malicious programs. In dynamic network environments, the DDPV method showed good adaptability, could effectively control the propagation of malicious programs under different dynamic conditions, and maintained high network gains and patch success rates. Therefore, adopting the designed malicious program patch control method can effectively suppress the spread of malicious programs by quickly identifying and sending patches, providing strong support for building a secure network environment.},

  abstract = {In the context of educational digital transformation and the deep integration of intelligent technologies, Mixed Reality (MR) technology has enabled the creation of immersive collaborative environments, offering a novel paradigm for student team-based innovation and design practice. However, the exponential growth of interaction data and the dynamic complexity of collaborative scenarios in MR environments have presented a critical challenge: accurately capturing behavioral features within both human-computer interaction (HCI) and social collaborative interaction (SCI) to improve collaborative efficiency. Existing research demonstrates three major limitations: (i) single-modality data are insufficient to reflect the social context of team collaboration; (ii) static feature extraction methods fail to accommodate the evolving demands of design tasks; and (iii) inadequate modeling of team role differentiation has resulted in suboptimal interdisciplinary collaboration recommendations. To address these issues, a dynamic interaction recommendation method based on dual interaction relationship inference was proposed. A five-layered processing model—comprising an input layer, embedding layer, student preference extraction layer, team preference extraction layer, and prediction layer—was constructed. Dynamic student operation trajectories were captured using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, while global and local attention mechanisms were employed to integrate team interaction data, enabling multi-level modeling of both personalized preferences and collaborative contexts. This study represents the first integration of dual interaction relationships into a recommendation framework, overcoming the limitations of conventional single-modality approaches. A dynamic, role-sensitive solution is thereby provided for intelligent collaboration systems in MR-based educational environments, offering significant theoretical and practical implications for the digital transformation of education.},

To solve the problem of insufficient depth in tourism data analysis, Apriori and strong association rule algorithms are studied to design tourism data mining techniques. Based on the traditional Apriori algorithm, this study analyzes its shortcomings in processing large amounts of data and proposes the use of correlation to fuse frequent itemsets in the Apriori algorithm, in order to improve the effectiveness of strong association rules. Meanwhile, parallelization is introduced to continue optimization, and the practical application value is analyzed and judged. The experiment outcomes indicate that when using the Apriori algorithm and strong association rule extraction for efficiency and accuracy experiments, the implementation time is reduced by 359%. The generated association rules account for 25.67% of the total, with an efficiency 2.6 times faster than other algorithms. The maximum and minimum correlation values are 1.3 and 1.1, respectively, with a range error of no more than 0.3. The changes in support and credibility are more stable and reliable than other algorithms. The data show that the optimized Apriori strong association rule mining algorithm designed has significantly improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

An Apriori association rule model based on transaction compression and hash optimization is proposed to address association classification between physical fitness indicators. Moreover, this study optimizes operational efficiency through preprocessing techniques and hash acceleration strategies. It introduces enhancement parameters to accurately identify and establish strong association rules to achieve efficient and accurate evaluation of student physical fitness. The results showed that by comparing the running time of K-means + FP-growth and improved FP-growth under different support levels, the improved FP-growth tended to stabilize after a support level of 0.2%. The optimized model improved the execution efficiency by 82.87%–88.4% compared to Apriori and FP-growth in physical measurement data processing. The effectiveness and reliability of the improved algorithm were verified by measuring strong association rules with the introduction of enhancement degree.

Financial staff play a very important role in an enterprise, and their mental health issues can have negative impacts on the operational efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. However, current methods for analyzing mental health suffer from high costs, low accuracy, and low efficiency. In response to this, a financial staff mental health analysis model that combines biosensing technology and decision tree algorithm is proposed. This model is applied to enterprise management work. The study first takes the biomechanical feature of pulse waves as the analysis basis, collects pulse wave signals using photoelectric sensors, and analyzes the variability of pulse rate. Afterwards, the variability features are input into a deep forest model integrated based on decision tree algorithm for psychological state recognition. The study selected 100 employees as the research subjects. Through a 3-month follow-up monitoring period, data was collected and the validity of the model was verified. The F1 score, recognition accuracy, recognition time, and recall rate were 0.94, 95.28%, 2.31 seconds, and 93.84%, respectively. Compared with other models, its performance was significantly better. In addition, in practical application experiments, the psychological health analysis accuracy of the proposed model reached 95.35%. In practical applications, the turnover rate and performance of the financial staff in the corresponding enterprises decreased and increased by 8.09% and 10.20%, respectively.

In performance testing, the average gas consumption of this technology in blockchain is only 1.12, far lower than other technologies, and the resource cost advantage is obvious. In the encryption time test, when the number of encryption attributes exceeds 45, the traditional encryption technology significantly increases the encryption time. However, the research technology is similar to reference, and when the number of attributes is between 5 and 15, there is a 7.25% improvement in encryption performance compared to reference. In addition, in government recorded scenarios, the interception rate reached 99.4% under high load (1500 attacks), with 1491 intercepted attacks, outperforming other technologies. In addition, in the delay and throughput testing of the encryption process, the maximum delay of the research technology was only 352 ms when the encryption attributes were 68, and the maximum throughput was 3584 TX/s, both of which were superior to similar technologies.

  abstract = {Developing critical thinking skills (CTS) and reading comprehension ability (RCA) is crucial for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners, yet many struggle with these cognitive competencies. Although project-based learning (PBL) has been widely recognized for its pedagogical benefits, existing research has primarily focused on quantitative evidence of its effectiveness, with limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which PBL fosters these skills. Moreover, few studies have explored how PBL supports CTS and RCA development in Chinese college EFL contexts. To address these gaps, this study explores how PBL facilitates the development of CTS and RCA by employing a qualitative case study approach. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, classroom observations, and journals. Purposive sampling with maximum variation was employed, and three cases from high, medium, and low levels of CTS and RCA were selected as participants of the study. Thematic analysis was conducted within cases and across cases. The study reveals that PBL fosters CTS by engaging students in problem-solving, inquiry-based learning, and reflective evaluation. In addition, it enhances RCA by integrating explicit reading instruction, authentic material engagement, and collaborative discussions. Moreover, the study highlights differentiated development pathways in CTS and RCA across learners with varying proficiency levels, supported by adaptive scaffolding that facilitates their integrated growth. The findings contribute to the literature by proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the cognitive and instructional mechanisms through which PBL supports CTS and RCA development in EFL contexts.},

  abstract = {This research introduces the optical holographic encryption system, utilizing a novel method that significantly enhances security in underwater communications. The holographic message is encrypted using a particular algorithm called expanded Diffie–Hellman (EDH). Two methods of expansion are accomplished by the elliptic curves EDH-ec and three-dimension of a quaternion function EDH-q, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation of security is finished using the Pollard’s Rho method for the proposed EDH algorithm. Finally, both methods have been subject to security assessments through the application of NIST tests, which evaluate the randomness of the transmitted messages. The NIST test results show that the

The design adopts a hybrid energy storage structure of lithium batteries and supercapacitors, a dual closed-loop controller and a three-port power converter, which ensures the voltage stability of the system during load fluctuations. To further reduce the cost of tillage, a combination of photovoltaic power generation and three-port power converter is used to realize the efficient management of energy flow between the photovoltaic module, energy storage module, and motor.

  abstract = {(1) Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis, surgical planning, and therapeutic monitoring, but existing methods face significant challenges due to the complex structures of human organs, including substantial size variations, indistinct boundaries, and low inter-tissue contrast. (2) To address this, we propose SDM-UNet, a hybrid network integrating CNN and Transformer modules to enhance segmentation performance. The architecture features a Multi-Attention Feature Refinement (MAFR) block replacing the Swin-UNet bottleneck, which combines adaptive kernel convolution, enhanced convolution, and channel attention to improve local feature extraction, and Multi-Fusion Dense Skip Connections that facilitate multi-scale feature fusion between the encoder and decoder to mitigate spatial information loss during downsampling. (3) Validated on the Synapse multi-organ CT and ACDC cardiac MRI datasets, SDM-UNet was trained using the PyTorch framework with ImageNet-pretrained weights and evaluated via Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95). (4) Experimental results show that SDM-UNet achieves an average DSC of 80.51% and HD95 of 22.09 mm on Synapse, and an average DSC of 90.58% and HD95 of 1.12 mm on ACDC, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Swin-UNet and SCUNet++ and demonstrating its superiority in balancing global context understanding and local detail preservation.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, Linux operating system, as an open source system, is widely used in servers, embedded devices, and cloud computing platforms. Because of its stability, flexibility, and efficiency, Linux systems play a role in many key areas. However, with the complexity of application environment and the expansion of system scale, the reliability and performance evaluation of Linux system have gradually become the focus of research. Based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, this paper proposes a new reliability benchmarking and dynamic performance evaluation method of Linux system. By constructing a fuzzy evaluation model, the reliability of Linux system is comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated, and through comparative analysis, the dynamic performance optimization strategy of Linux system in different running environments is put forward. Based on experimental data and actual usage scenarios, this paper collects performance data of multiple Linux systems in terms of load, network transmission, IO operation, etc., covering mainstream versions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian. Through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of these data, the reliability scores of different system versions are obtained, and their performance bottlenecks are deeply analyzed. The experimental results show that the reliability score of Ubuntu system under high load conditions is 82.5%, while the reliability score of CentOS system is slightly lower at 78.3%. Through dynamic performance evaluation, it is found that IO performance fluctuates significantly under high concurrency, which affects the stability and response speed of the system. The evaluation method proposed in this paper can not only accurately reflect the performance of Linux system in practical application but also provide theoretical basis and technical support for system optimization. The research results are of great significance to improve the reliability and performance of Linux systems, especially in large-scale applications and demanding industry environments.},

  abstract = {Chinese ceramic culture has a long history, and Chinese ceramics are closely related to the process of Chinese history. In each era, the dissemination and evolution of Chinese ceramics has formed its own characteristics in the dissemination background and channels, dissemination characteristics, and dissemination influences. Ceramic culture is the common artistic language of mankind, which exists in the form of a special cultural symbol. It has a long history and profound cultural heritage, and plays an important role in Sino-foreign exchanges. However, there are many difficulties and challenges in the process of communication and dissemination with cultures from all over the world. It is increasingly an important topic to study the propagation path of ceramic culture, so as to promote overseas spread for ceramic culture. This work uses complex networks to predict and analyze the propagation path of ceramic culture. First, this work selects the BP network as the basic framework to predict the propagation path of ceramic culture. Neural networks are complex networks that can perform such tasks efficiently. Second, because the BP algorithm has problems such as slow convergence and easy to be affected by the initial weight, this work uses the PSO algorithm to make up for the shortcomings of BP algorithm. To solve slow convergence in the later stage of the PSO algorithm and easy to fall into local optimum, this paper adopts improved strategy with dynamic inertia weight and dynamic learning factor. Third, this work integrates the improved PSO (IPSO) with the BP network to construct an IPSO-BP network, and realizes the prediction of the propagation path of ceramic culture based on IPSO-BP.},

  abstract = {Whether tourism resources can be scientifically and effectively developed and utilized is directly related to the amount of economic benefits that tourism resources bring to developers, as well as the revenue data of the local tourism industry. Therefore, how to develop tourism resources has become the main issue that countless scenic area developers need to study today. When formulating a tourism resource development plan using traditional methods, it is usually necessary to arrange researchers to evaluate the quantity and quality of the tourism resources owned by the scenic area. This process often takes several months, and after obtaining the evaluation data, it will be submitted to the decision-making level for repeated and unpredictable meetings and discussions. The discussion mainly focuses on the proportion of service investment and specific measures for each resource in the scenic area, and finally a preliminary plan is obtained. In response to the drawbacks of traditional methods such as time-consuming and cumbersome steps, this study attempts to apply genetic algorithms to optimize the development of tourism resources, hoping to provide an intelligent and efficient method for formulating development plans. The process of using genetic algorithms to develop tourism resource development plans is as follows. Firstly, the optimization task was modeled, abstracted into a mathematical representation that the model can understand, and model parameters were set for subsequent iterative tasks; then, the population was randomly initialized to provide a richer gene pool for the entire population, allowing individuals in the population to be distributed throughout the solution space. Next, it is necessary to iterate the population, where individuals within the population undergo selection, crossover, and mutation in each iteration round, while adding randomness to evolve towards higher fitness values. When the iteration round ends, the highest fitness value of individuals in the population can converge, and this individual represents the best solution considered by the model. Five simulation experiments were conducted in this article. The initial population size was 100, 120, 140, 80, and 70, and the number of iteration rounds was 100, 80, 70, 110, and 130. Finally, the highest fitness values of the five experiments all converge to 208.9, and the X of the individual with the highest fitness values converges to [1,1,1,0,0]. Y converges approximately at [0.44, 0.41, 0.15, 0,0], and Z converges at [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]. Finally, this article also compares with examples of rural tourism development to verify the effectiveness and practicality of genetic algorithms in optimizing tourism resources. After calculation, the sample distance between excellent development cases and model generated solutions is 7.512, the sample distance between negative cases and model generated solutions is 31.836, and the sample distance between fuzzy cases and model generated solutions is 16.757. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of genetic algorithms can provide scientific decision support and methodological guidance for the development and utilization of tourism resources.},

  abstract = {With the widespread application of AI image generation technology in higher education design fields, traditional design education models face the necessity of reevaluation. This study aims to explore how design aesthetic features (as objective product attributes) influence designers’ creative thinking and design expression (as subjective capabilities), and accordingly reassess the educational value of foundational design courses in the AI era. Using a comparative experimental method, the research recruited 25 first-year and 25 third-year industrial design students to create product designs using Midjourney, with 36 industrial design experts systematically evaluating the works. Results indicate that design aesthetic features significantly impact design expression more than design thinking, and the two student groups demonstrate notable differences in design element application: novice design students primarily express creativity through intuitive visual elements such as product patterns and product appearance, while advanced students more effectively utilize professional design elements like form contours and material textures, reflecting how design education facilitates students' transition from perceptual cognition to rational analysis. Additionally, the positive correlation between creative thinking and design expression strengthens with deepening design education, indicating a mutually reinforcing relationship. Based on these findings, the paper suggests that foundational design courses in the AI-generated imagery era need repositioning: color and expression courses should shift from basic skill training to high-level theoretical education, creative thinking courses significantly increase in importance, form and material courses maintain core value but need content updates aligned with AI characteristics, while human-computer collaborative design should become a new curricular direction. This study provides an empirical foundation for design education reform in the AI era, emphasizing the importance of understanding design essentials and cultivating innovative thinking.},

It enables teachers and students alike to communicate a gamut of emotions through its visuals. Nevertheless, the abstract and subjective nature of emotions coupled with the intricate and nonlinear relationship between image characteristics and image sentiment presents a formidable challenge in image emotion classification. Thus, this study proposes a novel image emotion classification model that integrates the depth separable convolution technique. First, the RGB features of the image are extracted through the judicious use of yellow correction, brightness adjustment, and size scaling, while optimizing color video signal transmission with YCrCb. Second, the deep semantic features of the image are extracted through multi-scale fusion features using an improved FPN model, wherein pre-training parameters of ResNet101 are transferred to the model. Finally, the emotion semantics in art images are classified using a convolution block attention module to form a depth separable convolution. Experimental results reveal that the 33 image evaluation features obtained through training have a strong correlation with the expressed emotional semantics. The predictive capacity of the proposed model aligns with the true polarity of the sample with a remarkable accuracy of 93.31% in emotional classification.},

In addition to using the short-term energy difference (STED) technique to precisely determine the temporal assessment of every note in the audio of a piano performance. Additionally, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to assess pitch accuracy. The entire system is integrated within a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) framework to facilitate detailed evaluation of piano performances. The piano performances are categorized as “Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor” in this examination, which is structured for a classification problem. Our findings emphasize the efficacy of the SHS-IPNN technique, as demonstrated by its overall performance in terms of recall (90.5%), accuracy (96%), F1-score (93.5%), and precision (95.5%). The experimental outcomes indicate that the SHS-IPNN model outperforms existing methods in terms of accurately detecting performance errors and evaluating piano performances. The model’s increased accuracy in providing expressive, rhythmic, and overall judgments is demonstrative of this development. The innovative application of the SHS-IPNN method in piano music education demonstrates a significant advancement in the field. This approach not only improves accuracy in performance evaluation but also improves the learning procedure by providing error correction, which is crucial for developing proficient piano skills.},

  abstract = {Portrait painting, as a traditional art form, has seen increasing research efforts aimed at automating its creation with the advancement of computer technology. Currently, research on computer-generated portrait painting primarily focuses on using deep learning models to generate high-quality artistic style works from input images. However, despite the application of advanced technologies such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) in this field, there are still shortcomings in terms of preserving image details and features. To address this, the study proposes a portrait design model based on dynamic receptive fields (DyRF), whose core innovation lies in introducing multi-scale convolutional modules and adaptive receptive field mechanisms to achieve dynamic perception of features and precise reconstruction of details in different image regions, significantly enhancing the image’s ability to retain details and artistic expression. Experimental results show that DyRF significantly outperforms comparison models on multiple key metrics: achieving a Fréchet depth distance (FID) of 12.21, approximately 30% lower than DyMo (17.65) and FSGAN (23.66); it achieves a feature similarity (FSIM) of 0.85, significantly higher than SCA-GAN (0.71) and FSGAN (0.68), indicating superior performance in terms of image realism and feature consistency. The research results validate the effectiveness of the DyRF model in detail reconstruction and feature retention, bringing new breakthroughs to the field of computer-generated art.},

The study proposes a clustering visualization algorithm based on intelligent big data to achieve efficient processing and real-time analysis of massive multi-dimensional landscape design data, and intuitively presents data correlation and difference by establishing data field and radiation effect, providing designers with clearer design ideas. At the same time, VR technology is introduced to build an immersive virtual environment, so that designers and users can intuitively experience the landscape effect in three-dimensional space, breaking through the limitations of traditional plane or two-dimensional display methods. The experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, this method significantly improves the scientificity, interactivity, and design efficiency of landscape design schemes: the enthusiasm of designers is increased by 70%, and 66.3% of designers say that the design time is greatly shortened; public satisfaction is increased from 13.3% “very satisfied” under traditional design to 50%, and design risks and costs are effectively controlled. Research shows that the integration of intelligent big data and VR technology not only solves the pain points in the traditional design process but also promotes the transformation of design thinking from one-way expression to multi-party collaboration, expands the expressiveness and social acceptance of landscape design, and provides the industry with a new technical path and practice paradigm.},

Multi-objective tracking method based on the fusion of pedestrian derecognition and player number features. According to the problem of high target similarity, a feature dimension fusion strategy is proposed, which combines target characteristics from different dimensions (e.g., appearance, motion, and jersey numbers) to enhance the algorithm’s discriminative ability for similar targets. The experiments show that the proposed multi-feature fusion tracking method can still achieve a better tracking effect in the case of high target similarity, with direct applications in real-time analysis of athletes’ movement trajectories and tactical behaviors during physical education classes. Different IoU thresholds can ultimately affect the tracking performance of the algorithm to a large extent, providing quantitative support for optimizing teaching evaluation systems. It can be seen from the results that when the IoU threshold is 0.5, the algorithm achieves the best tracking performance, with the HOTA index improving by 3.8 points compared to the benchmark method, AssA index by 6.4 points compared to the benchmark method, and IDF 1 index by 7.1 points compared to the benchmark method. When the IoU threshold is 0.6 and 0.7, the HOTA index increased by 3.2 and 2.2 points compared to the benchmark method; the AssA index increased by 5.1 and 4.0 points with the benchmark method. To solve the problem of severe target occlusion, a twin network (a neural network architecture with two parallel branches for feature extraction and similarity calculation) is introduced to enhance anti-occlusion capabilities by modeling target motion and contextual information. The tracking method consists of three-level target associations, and the similarity needed to calculate the association is calculated using the information of twin network, multi-feature fusion, and spatial location. To solve the problem of severe target occlusion, the twin network method is introduced to use the algorithm in anti-occlusion.

  abstract = {Forklifts, as one of the most commonly used transportation tools in current engineering construction, have extremely high research value. With the increasing energy-saving requirements of the forklift industry, energy-saving improvement of the lifting system in the hydraulic lifting system of forklifts has become a research hotspot. To optimize the energy saving of the forklift hydraulic lifting system, this research proposes to use the secondary regulation technology to optimize it. The gravity potential energy generated in the lifting of the load is recovered through the secondary components, and stored in the energy accumulator to provide energy for the operation of the system, to reduce the energy consumption of the engine. The experimental results show that compared to traditional lifting systems, the proposed secondary regulation lifting system saves 29 kJ of energy consumption and can achieve an efficiency of 87.8%. In addition, the load weight, lifting speed, and energy storage capacity all have varying degrees of influence on the energy consumption of the improved secondary regulation system. When the load weight is 5 kg and 15 kg, the energy consumption difference between the two is 75 kJ, and the displacement difference is 0 m. When the lifting speed is 0.1 m/s and 0.3 m/s, the displacement distance difference between the two is 1.5 m, and the energy consumption difference is 123 kJ. When the energy storage capacity is 5 L and 11 L, the displacement distance difference is 0.1 m, and the energy consumption difference is 89 kJ.

Firstly, a deep convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a large general image dataset to obtain the basic visual feature representation and then fine-tuned and optimized on a professional mural dataset through a domain adaptive method. The feature extraction stage innovatively integrates the high-level semantic features of deep neural networks with the low-level artistic features of traditional image processing. Among them, the deep features are extracted through an improved residual network architecture, while the artistic features blend the color distribution features based on the HSV color space with the improved rotational invariance LBP texture features. The system innovatively designs a feature fusion module based on the attention mechanism, achieving dynamic optimization and combination of multi-source features through learnable feature weights. Experimental verification shows that, compared with mainstream deep network models, this system has achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy of feature recognition in the era of murals.

  abstract = {An embedded teaching system based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL) offers significant pedagogical advantages. This article investigates the impact of integrating PBL methods into classroom instruction, guided by students’ learning objectives and supported by questionnaire responses. The study focuses on six IPTC classes at a university where PBL was implemented, examining various aspects of the implementation process and proposing corresponding countermeasures. As electronic devices increasingly rely on embedded systems, engineers face escalating challenges in system design and must acquire new, interdisciplinary skills. To meet these demands, it is essential for engineers to bridge knowledge gaps across traditionally distinct fields. However, there are ongoing concerns that current educational institutions do not provide a sufficiently robust foundation for such interdisciplinary learning. This study employed comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of PBL-based instruction, using both test scores and student feedback. A paired-sample test comparing post-test results between the control and experimental groups revealed a statistically significant difference (
            p
            = 0.001&lt; 0.05), indicating that PBL had a positive effect on student learning outcomes. These findings suggest that integrating PBL into IPTC courses can enhance teaching methods and drive meaningful curriculum reform. This approach supports pedagogical goals such as fostering innovation and developing core competencies, making it a valuable strategy for advancing modern education.},

  abstract = {As globalization accelerates, the significance of English in international communication becomes increasingly prominent, making the effective learning of English vocabulary a pivotal aspect of language acquisition. This study aims to explore a personalized grading method for English vocabulary learning difficulty through machine learning technology, facilitating learners in more efficiently mastering English vocabulary. Initially, the paper analyzes the limitations of traditional methods for grading the difficulty of English vocabulary learning, highlighting the lack of dynamic adaptation to the differences among learners. Subsequently, it introduces a novel approach to predicting the difficulty of learning English vocabulary using machine learning, particularly through the application of transfer learning techniques at the edge. This method adjusts the prediction model based on the learner’s background knowledge and learning history, thus enhancing the accuracy and applicability of predictions. Finally, by predicting the English vocabulary learning difficulty levels of students at different stages (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), this study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the machine learning model employing transfer learning demonstrates significant advantages in grading the difficulty of English vocabulary learning, offering more personalized learning guidance to learners of varying levels. The findings of this research not only provide a new perspective for the field of English education but also offer technical support for designing personalized learning paths.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of audio information resources, the efficient management and accurate retrieval of massive music data have become the focus of research. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of music data retrieval, a method combining local maximum chromaticity energy with note onset detection is proposed. The piano audio fingerprint is constructed by extracting key features and generating digital identifiers. The innovation of this method lies in using note start detection to capture transient features in audio signals and combining local maximum chromaticity energy points to enhance the uniqueness and robustness of audio fingerprints. The experimental results showed that the overall recognition accuracy of the constructed fingerprint technology performed well in different dataset sizes, remaining around 93%. The recognition accuracy fluctuated around 93% in general and decreased slightly when the dataset size was larger than 400. When the dataset was 1,000, the recognition accuracy was about 90%. In terms of the audio fingerprint extraction effect, the technology had a maximum fingerprint distance of 0.80 for the songs of

However, existing literature investigations reveal a scarcity of theoretical research focusing on Chinese tea brand assets from a consumer perspective; this will inevitably lead to a lack of theoretical experience support for tea brands in the practical process, affecting the construction of brand assets. This study aims to clarify the constituent factors of tea brand assets and explore the interrelationships among these factors. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, the constituent factors of tea brand assets were identified. By formulating theoretical hypotheses, a model for tea brand assets was proposed and an assessment scale was developed. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was conducted based on the scale, followed by a reliability and validity test of the data and model using factor analysis. The results demonstrate that tea brand assets from a consumer perspective consist of Brand Awareness, Brand Association, Perceived Quality, and Brand Loyalty, with interconnections among these factors that influence brand assets. Notably, there is a significant correlation between Brand Awareness and Brand Association, while Brand Awareness does not significantly affect Perceived Quality. Brand Association positively impacts Perceived Quality and Brand Loyalty. Both Brand Awareness and Perceived Quality significantly influence Brand Loyalty.},

  abstract = {Customer engagement is a cornerstone of successful power marketing, especially as energy providers move towards digital transformation. However, traditional marketing strategies often fail to capture real-time customer sentiment and adapt dynamically to individual needs. The research introduces a data-driven method utilizing deep learning (DL)-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and respond to customer feedback, thereby enhancing engagement through personalized, timely, and context-aware communication. Data was collected from social media, customer service chat transcripts, and online feedback from energy company websites. The text was refined using preprocessing techniques such as lemmatization and stop-word removal. Word2Vec was used for feature extraction to capture the semantic meaning and context of customer expressions. The proposed method integrates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with an Attention-based Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (Att-TCNN) to capture contextual and temporal features in customer communication. The system uses BERT to understand customer language and track behavioral patterns by extracting contextual word representations and processing them through temporal convolution layers enhanced with attention, focusing on relevant text sequence parts. This hybrid BERT-Att-TCNN approach supports sentiment classification, topic identification, and engagement prediction, delivering personalized, adaptive, and real-time customer engagement in power marketing. Python was used to implement and train the model efficiently. Results from experimental evaluation demonstrate that the proposed BERT-Att-TCNN model achieved performance metrics ranging from 90 to 96%, highlighting the model’s robustness and reliability compared to traditional NLP models. This hybrid approach ensures scalable, intelligent, and real-time engagement in modern power marketing management.},

The critical challenge in this method lies in accurately identifying the arrival time of the travelling wave signals. To address this, two different wavelet basis functions were selected to process the travelling wave signals, and their effectiveness in processing the same fault at different locations was compared and analyzed. The results show that the db4 wavelet better retains the original signal features. The error range for the Haar wavelet was 0.4289–0.6948 km, while for the db4 wavelet it was 0.0301–0.2960 km. Thus, the db4 wavelet provides more accurate ranging than the Haar wavelet.},

  abstract = {Property engineering project management is faced with increasingly complex risks and challenges. If these risks are not effectively controlled, it is easy to lead to cost overruns, time delays and even project failures. This study proposes a property engineering construction safety risk assessment method based on the IT2FS-MARCOS method to address the uncertainty of risk assessment caused by the subjectivity of expert decision-making and the problem of considering multiple risk factors under different risk parameter weights. A property engineering construction safety risk indicator evaluation system was constructed, and the combination of the G1 weighting method and the objective weighting method (CRITIC) was used to analyze the weights of each risk indicator. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) were introduced to improve the compromise-based alternative ranking method (MARCOS) in multicriteria decision-making. The utility function values of each risk factor were calculated, and the construction safety risk factors of property engineering projects were analyzed and evaluated based on the utility function values. The findings reveal the dynamic process of construction risks in property engineering projects. The model not only considers the fuzziness of expert evaluation but also adopts a multicriteria decision-making method to avoid simple weighting of risk parameters. This method has a high degree of fit with engineering practice and provides a new approach of handling risk assessment in uncertain information of property engineering.},

  abstract = {Under corporate crises, the formation of credit relationships based on group-level credit reciprocity strategies is a multi-factorial phenomenon. From the perspective of a fully mixed corporate group, the research explores the inadequacy of traditional snowdrift game models in adapting to the structural elements of credit relationship formation. Firstly, it improves the model by introducing inter-temporal costs, benefits, and crisis randomness of credit reciprocity as decision parameters. Secondly, it introduces inter-temporal credit reciprocity as a condition to allow the snowdrift game model to express the evolution between corporate groups. Finally, based on credit reciprocity, the mechanism of credit relationship formation is verified through numerical simulations. The results show that under the crisis probability, the formation of credit relationships exhibits a “threshold trigger,” and the inter-firm assistance and crisis probability play an important role in establishing credit relationships between enterprises.},

  abstract = {There is often a latent period before the outbreak of financial crisis in enterprises, and reliable financial crisis warning is crucial for the stable development of enterprises. At present, significant achievements have been made in the field of financial crisis prediction, but the systematic research on the mechanism of financial crisis formation is still insufficient. This study aims to deeply analyze the formation mechanism of chronic financial crises, improve the accuracy of financial crisis warning by introducing a penalty logistic regression model, and provide a basis for enterprises to prevent, control, and overcome difficulties. This study uses the financial statement data of 2155 listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2017 to 2024, and combines the three penalty functions of Lasso, SCAD and MCP to analyze these data. Through cross-validation, this paper selects the optimal adjustment parameters, constructs a penalized logistic regression model, and compares it with the standard logistic regression model. Research has shown that the MCP penalty logistic regression model performs the best in accuracy (89.6 ± 0.8%), F1 score (0.852), AUC value (0.918), and other aspects, outperforming the standard logistic regression model and other penalty logistic regression models. The MCP model identified 15 important financial indicators that have a significant predictive effect on the company’s financial crisis. Overall, the financial crisis warning model combined with MCP penalty logistic regression performs well in prediction accuracy and variable selection ability, providing an effective financial crisis warning tool for enterprises.},

  abstract = {Reliable grid management is critical for the efficiency and stability of electrical transmission and distribution systems. As grid systems become more sophisticated and complex, there is an increased need for digital asset management and automation to make operations more efficient. A lot of standard grid management techniques include manual physical inspection and repair of assets. These methods tend to take too long and raise operational costs. The proposed project will improve the grid management methods by employing both digital asset feature identification and automation. The intention is to promote greater operational efficiency through automation identified through real-time monitoring of decision-making processes. The proposed process will include identifying digital maintenance features on grid assets, including transformers, electricity lines, and meters, using IoT sensors. To standardize the input values, the data is pre-processed with procedures such as z-score normalization. Features including voltage, temperature, and current are extracted using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units with Grid Search Optimization (AttenBi-GRU-GSO) method are used to analyze the processed data to predict the faults and optimize performance. The AttenBi-GRU-GSO combines the attention mechanism to focus on critical features, Bi-GRU to capture sequential dependencies from both past and future, and GSO to fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters for optimal performance, ensuring efficient and accurate fault detection and prediction in grid management. Experimental results demonstrate that the AttenBi-GRU-GSO method achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 95.31%, an MAE loss of 0.11, a total loss of 0.07, and an RMSE loss of 0.03. Automated systems provide control of detected problems by responding with remedial actions, including rerouting power and organizing maintenance. The automation increases the accuracy and speed of fault detection, as well as reduces downtime and maintenance costs. Digital asset feature identification and automation enhances grid management, lowers operating costs, and increases total electrical network reliability. The proposed technology provides a scalable platform for current grid operations.},

  abstract = {With the booming development of e-commerce, personalized recommendation systems have become the key to attracting users. However, traditional recommendation systems face user diversity and information overload, driving the search for more intelligent and adaptable solutions. Therefore, a multi-recommendation model for e-commerce is proposed by integrating backpropagation algorithm and genetic algorithm. The backpropagation algorithm is used to learn user historical behavior data and establish an initial recommendation model. Then, the genetic algorithm is applied to evolve and optimize the model to meet the personalized needs. Through continuous iteration and evolution, the recommendation model can better capture the potential interests and behavioral patterns of users. The proposed method reached the target value after 51 iterations, which was significantly faster than that of the pre-optimized model. The latter reached the standard after 100 iterations. In terms of error, the highest value was 43, with an average of about 15, while the highest value of the optimized network was only 40, with an average of about 12. Therefore, the optimized network performed significantly better than the pre-optimized network. The multi-recommendation mode based on optimized backpropagation algorithm performs better than traditional methods. This study provides a new approach for the design and optimization of e-commerce recommendation systems.},

We conducted a randomized controlled experiment with 72 mining professionals to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive VR training system featuring network security elements on behavioral awareness, contrasted with traditional training approaches. The study specifically examines underground mining personnel across four high-risk operational roles, employing a randomized controlled trial design with validated psychological empowerment measures based on established empowerment and social cognitive theories. The results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in all safety metrics evaluated, with the greatest gains in correct identification of threats (experimental group: 82.5% vs control group: 52.6%) and response times to integrated physical-digital threats (41.5% faster). The data indicate that psychological empowerment, particularly strong competence perception (r = 0.74) and impact (r = 0.65) perceptions, is an essential mediator between VR training and safety outcomes. The Security-Safety Risk Integration model developed in this research aids in explaining the interplay of the multiple theoretical elements such as human perception, technical vulnerabilities, and psychological empowerment elements within a complex mining environment. These findings enhance the understanding of risk perception from a theoretical perspective and practical measures for safety-security training in advanced industrial systems.},

In this technology, the research is based on the improved diffusion least mean square algorithm for clustering sampling, using different graph filters to train parameters and a clustering strategy to complete sampling. In addition, a multi-task power grid voltage graph signal detection technique with improved high pass filtering is proposed, and power grid data security detection is achieved through threshold setting and projection detection. In the analysis of graph signal processing, the research model has better steady-state learning performance. For example, in the transient mean square deviation test of multitasking scenarios, its convergence value is −31.25 dB, which is better than similar models. In the single-task transient mean square deviation test, the research model is closer to the reference standard, with a convergence value of −34.25 dB and better learning ability.

Conventional forecasting models struggle with accuracy, scalability, and robust optimization, especially when dealing with non-linear, high-dimensional energy datasets. Moreover, they lack adaptability to volatile demand–supply dynamics and real-time operational constraints. This research presents a next-generation intelligent platform that integrates a Weighted Golden Eagle Optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (WGEO-LightGBM) for predictive modeling and operational optimization in electricity marketing and service delivery. Data is collected from IoT-based smart meters and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, encompassing load demand, pricing signals, and historical consumption trends. The collected data were preprocessed using missing value imputation, Min-Max scaling, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to enhance model input quality and reduce feature redundancy. The WGE algorithm enhances the search efficiency and solution diversity by adaptively adjusting flight dynamics and prey targeting mechanisms. LightGBM, a fast, scalable regression model, is used for short-term load forecasting and price prediction, enabling real-time pricing, demand-side management, efficient service delivery, and resource allocation. The WGEO-LightGBM model predicted load values ranging from approximately 120 MW–160 MW across multiple hourly intervals, closely aligning with actual observations and demonstrating its precision in dynamic grid environments.

We propose a novel sea horse optimized-versatile deep convolutional neural network (SHO-VDCNN) algorithm for recognizing innovative interior designs in living spaces. At first we gathered a dataset, to train our proposed recognition model. Image standardization is employed to pre-process the gathered data. In this research, we utilize a VR interior design layout mechanism to improve the potential of autonomous layout interior while enhancing interactions of machines with virtualization. Furthermore, the optimal placements (states) for these internal model components in simulated environments could be spontaneously identified by employing the deep Q-learning network (DQN) method. The proposed model is implemented in Python software. We assessed our suggested framework with various evaluation metrics. We also conducted a comparison analysis to examine the effectiveness of the suggested paradigm. The experimental findings demonstrate that the approached recognition model performed better than other traditional learning models for recognizing interior design frameworks in living spaces.},

  abstract = {In today’s era of widespread education, there is a complex correlation between students’ academic performance and their behavior. In order to find the potential relationship between students’ learning behavior and academic performance from complex teaching data and provide better teaching solutions for educators, this paper used the Apriori algorithm to mine association rules in educational data. This study collected learning data from 5000 students in their first to third year of high school from a key higher education institution and a non-key higher education institution. Through data preprocessing and transformation, the optimized Apriori algorithm was used for frequent itemset mining, and four main learning behavior patterns were identified: online discussion, completing assignments on time, classroom participation, and additional reading. The experimental results show that the optimized algorithm reduces the execution time by 32% from 12.5 seconds before optimization to 8.5 seconds after optimization when processing the same amount of data. The performance of the optimized algorithm is stable when processing large-scale data. As the amount of data increases, the running time of the algorithm steadily increases from 2.4 seconds to 15.0 seconds, and the number of frequent itemsets gradually increases from 48 to 270. Research has found a significant correlation between frequent participation in online discussions and timely completion of assignments with student performance, particularly among students who attend regularly and have a higher Grade Point Average (GPA), with support and confidence levels of 0.22 and 0.85, respectively. The results of this study have been successfully applied to the development of targeted tutoring and personalized learning plans in a certain higher education institution, which significantly improved students’ academic performance and classroom participation.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement in educational technology has ushered in an era where multimodal learning environments are increasingly recognized as crucial for fostering students’ cognitive and emotional development. This research explores the dual impact of these environments, integrating diverse sensory information, including visual and auditory inputs, thus offering enriched learning experiences with potential influences on students’ cognitive and emotional states. A notable gap in current research is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how multimodal learning environments distinctly affect these aspects of student development. Traditional methodologies in this field often fail to account for the dynamic nature and individual variances inherent in the learning process, thereby limiting the depth of insights into the influence mechanisms of these environments. To bridge these gaps, this study employs a dual-methodological approach. Firstly, a sophisticated correlation matrix is developed to diagnose cognitive development within multimodal learning environments, effectively identifying key factors in cognitive processes. Secondly, an innovative emotion recognition model is utilized, incorporating sensor feature embedding and temporal feature embedding techniques, to adeptly capture students’ emotional fluctuations within these settings. The findings from this study provide substantial implications for educational practice. They enable educators to enhance the design and optimization of learning environments, promoting not only cognitive growth but also emotional well-being among students. This approach underscores the importance of addressing both cognitive and emotional domains in educational settings to foster holistic development. This study innovatively establishes a matrix correlating students, learning items, and knowledge points, facilitating a joint analysis to diagnose the cognitive development mechanism within multimodal learning environments. Additionally, an emotion recognition model, combining both sensor and temporal feature embedding networks, has been constructed. This model accurately identifies and analyzes students’ emotional states. The primary contribution lies in providing a comprehensive method for evaluating both cognitive and emotional states of students, which aids in optimizing personalized learning strategies and enhancing educational outcomes.},

  abstract = {The inventory taking process in the archives is complex and error-prone, and the traditional manual method is inefficient. To this end, this study proposes a real-time inventory count model for archives that integrates QR code recognition and fingerprint encryption algorithms. This model adopts the Adaptive Median Filtering Algorithm (AMFA) to suppress salt-and-pepper noise, and combines the improved Otsu threshold segmentation and Hough transform to correct image distortion. The fingerprint feature encryption algorithm is introduced. Dynamic keys are generated through the translation, rotation, and scaling transformations of biometric feature points, forming double-layer encryption with the improved RC4 algorithm to achieve secure storage and access control of data. Experiments show that in the multi-source archive image test, the average MSE value of the model is 28.56 and the PSNR value is 32.45, which improves the noise suppression ability by 15.3% compared with the traditional median filtering algorithm. Facing complex scenarios, the decoding rates reached 87.33% and 92.11%, respectively, and the positioning accuracy rate reached 97.38%. Under the FGSM attack, the decoding rate of the model remained at 100%, and the EER value was only 0.92%. The above results prove that the proposed model has better encryption performance. This model effectively enhances the overall efficiency and intelligence level of archive management, providing technical support for promoting the automation of archive management.},

AR offers immersive, interactive visualizations that can enhance comprehension and decision-making processes in financial contexts. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of AR-enhanced data visualization in financial reporting and identify the barriers to its widespread adoption. The investigation provides a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative data from financial survey responses with qualitative insights from case studies of firms adopting AR in their financial reporting procedures. Data were collected over 6 months from 120 participants, focusing on user experience, comprehension levels, visual appeal, overall satisfaction, confidence in interpretation, and decision-making efficiency. Quantitative survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to summarize the respondents. Inferential statistical techniques, including t-tests and ANOVA, were employed to assess differences in comprehension and decision-making efficiency between users of AR-enhanced reporting tools and traditional methods utilizing SPSS software. Regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of successful AR adoption in financial reporting. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results show that AR-augmented financial reports greatly enhance user participation and comprehension of intricate financial information. Users provided feedback on greater efficiency in decision-making and increased confidence in the interpretation of financial information.

How to better integrate intelligent software into curriculum teaching to meet the needs of teachers and students and improve the teaching effectiveness is an issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Therefore, this article takes the teachers and students who have participated in the curriculum reform of “Marketing” as the research objects, applies multi-dimensional intelligent software to the “Marketing” course, uses SPSS software and AMOS software to complete the correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation model analysis of relevant factors, and forms a genuine large model + curriculum reform mode. The results show that 74% of the people support the use of multi-dimensional intelligent software in curriculum reform. However, 40% of them believe that they do not have enough technical proficiency in familiarizing themselves with the software itself. As a result, their willingness to recommend the digital software they have used to others is not high. The research findings indicate that the key to enhancing the effectiveness of curriculum reform is to improve the teachers’ and students’ own proficiency in using digital software, especially the intelligent components of digital and intelligent software. This paper suggests that more software training programs should be carried out in curriculum teaching, and more policy support related to intelligent software should be introduced, so as to better promote the improvement of the effectiveness of curriculum reform.},

This article aims to develop an intelligent international equipment manufacturing training platform by combining deep learning and virtual reality (VR) technology to address these issues. Firstly, the virtual reality technology was utilized to create immersive virtual environments, reducing reliance on physical equipment and venues, lowering costs and resource consumption, while eliminating security risks in real operations. Students could conduct practical training anytime and anywhere in a virtual environment, overcoming the limitations of traditional training in terms of time and space, and enhancing the flexibility and convenience of learning. Then, through deep learning algorithms CNN (convolutional neural network) and RNN (recurrent neural network), the platform could analyze students’ operational data in real-time and provide personalized feedback and guidance. The teaching content and difficulty were adjusted according to the learning progress and performance of the students, ensuring that each student can have a suitable learning experience. In addition, deep learning algorithms could automatically evaluate students’ operational skills and learning effectiveness, and generate detailed evaluation reports, making the evaluation process more objective and fair, and avoiding the influence of subjective factors. The training platform developed in this article could also simulate complex equipment manufacturing scenarios and troubleshooting processes, allowing students to significantly improve their scores in operational accuracy, efficiency, fault recognition ability, and problem-solving ability. The average improvement percentage of students in various evaluation indicators was about 43.83%.

  abstract = {This study examined the effects of the Tactical Programme for Critical Thinking (TPCT) on tactical performance and critical thinking (CT) in elite male underwater rugby (UWR) players. Twenty-four experienced players (mean age: 29.38 ± 7.11 years; playing experience: 10.86 ± 4.82 years) were randomly assigned to either a control (STR) or experimental (TPCT) group. Both followed identical physical, technical, and tactical training standards. Over 20 sessions (two per week), the TPCT group trained through core tactical principles of UWR, integrating guided reflection and collaborative decision-making to promote critical engagement with in-game situations. Tactical performance was evaluated using RUSTAC (Rugby Underwater Tactical Assessment Criteria), a validated observational tool developed for UWR that codes behaviours during game sequences, including spatial occupation, decision timing, and role consistency in both offensive and defensive phases. CT skills were measured using the Critical Thinking Measurement Index. Results showed that TPCT participants significantly improved tactical performance (p = 0.017; d = 0.81), while the STR group showed no significant changes. Both groups experienced slight, non-significant improvements in CT. These findings suggest TPCT may be effective for enhancing tactical performance in elite UWR athletes, although its direct effect on measurable CT remains inconclusive. Further longitudinal studies with larger samples are encouraged to assess the sustained cognitive impact of TPCT and its integration into high-performance settings. Practically, coaches may consider incorporating structured reflection and tactical questioning into training to deepen understanding and support decision-making under pressure.

Russian spaces, in contrast, foreground century-old stories, with nearly 41% of the corpus devoted to such materials, and score 54% on an informal semantic-adaptation metric.

Content rooted in tradition outlasts its contemporary cousins by a wide margin, attracting average user attention for just over 7 days in Chinese streams and for roughly 9 days in Russian ones; the shorter lifespan of modern posts hovers around 3 days in both contexts. Engagement styles diverge, too: Chinese users tend to share posts at a 39% rate, whereas Russian cohorts favor commenting, which they do at close to 43%.

It has high computational efficiency and can quickly complete data encryption and decryption). Hyperledger Fabric is employed to manage permissioned access, enforce data query control, and mitigate unauthorized operations. Security tests indicate that the system achieves high encryption efficiency—encrypting 2500 kb of data in 22 ms with a 32-bit key and achieving the fastest decryption at 443 ms with a 128-bit key. Compared to traditional systems, it significantly improves throughput (412 TPS vs 305 TPS) and risk interception (92 vs 52). These results demonstrate that the proposed system enhances cybersecurity in traceability applications by offering strong encryption, fine-grained access control, and high performance.

  abstract = {This research carried out the durability assessment of manufactured sand concrete under the combined effects of stray current and chloride ions. Experiments demonstrated that manufactured sand concrete resists chloride ion penetration 15%–25% more than natural sand concrete does, with the best performance registered at 6.4% stone powder content. Stray current causes the electromigration effect which causes chloride ion migration to be more rapid. The depth of chloride penetration is about 30% greater when 10 V is supplied compared to 40 V. COMSOL Multiphysics-based numerical simulations (a finite element analysis software) showed that the irregular morphology of manufactured sand particles increases the transport paths of chloride ions, creating a “tortuosity effect” with a value of 1.35. This value is higher than that of natural sand, which is 1.22, and the circular aggregate models, which is 1.15. At the same time, the stone powder filling effect reduces the porosity of concrete. The simulation results accurately matched the experimental data by more than 90% for the early stage of corrosion. This research offers theoretical evidence for the feasibility of manufactured sand concrete applications in coastal metro engineering and shows its best performance under severe conditions of stray current and chloride exposure. The use of manufactured sand provides significant sustainability benefits by reducing natural sand depletion and environmental impact while maintaining superior durability performance.},

Considering that these devices typically rely on battery power, high precision and stability are crucial. In order to improve the voltage resistance of ADC chips under high voltage, an innovative bootstrap sampling switch design is proposed, which utilizes the capacitance characteristics of NMOS and PMOS transistors to enhance the voltage resistance of the chip. At the same time, considering factors such as power fluctuations, time domain and voltage interleaving, a two-stage hybrid architecture based on successive approximation registers (SARs) and time to digital converters (TDCs) was studied and designed to optimize the balance between low power consumption and high voltage resistance performance. The results showed that the power consumption of the chip design was only 9.5 mW. The voltage compensation measures significantly reduced the error value from 7.01% to 1.97%, optimizing 5.04%. In summary, this design not only improves the accuracy and speed of ADC chips, but also successfully controls the exponential growth of power consumption, which has strong practical value. The proposed solution by the research institute has broad potential in multiple application fields, especially suitable for situations with high requirements for power consumption and stability, such as medical imaging and aerospace. This design provides new ideas and directions for the development of high-performance and low-power ADC chips in the future.},

Addressing this imperative, the merging of vocational education and lifelong learning is deemed essential, emerging as a cornerstone in contemporary educational discourse. Though the import of adaptive skills is universally acknowledged, the means to impart such training effectively remains elusive. Present technological strategies reveal shortcomings in provisioning individualized learning experiences and in extracting semantic information from textual content. Through the current investigation, a strategy is introduced whereby adaptive skills are fortified via intelligent recommendations, in tandem with an optimized Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network structure, aiming for an incisive classification of adaptive skill training texts. Such strategies not only delineate a fresh theoretical paradigm for adaptive skill instruction but also proffer cutting-edge technical reinforcement for the intertwined realms of vocational education and lifelong learning. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of an adaptive skill enhancement method based on intelligent recommendation and the design of an intelligent test item recommendation algorithm for adaptive skill enhancement. Additionally, the research introduces innovative improvements to the LSTM network structure by incorporating thematic semantic information, enabling the model to generate more accurate text representations, thereby significantly improving classification performance and the accuracy of personalized recommendations. These contributions provide effective technical support for enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive skill training.},

The results showed that at T8, the innovative thinking (78.9 points), critical thinking (80.2 points), and decision-making thinking (79.8 points) of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group, and their cognitive abilities (orientation, analysis, and evaluation) also improved significantly. This confirms that the mobile teaching model can effectively enhance students’ practical translation abilities.},

  abstract = {At present, intelligent oral English training mostly makes systematic intelligent discrimination by inputting human voices, and this method has a high false judgment rate, so it can’t realize targeted pronunciation correction. This study aims to address the issues of insufficient generalization of speech recognition in English oral training caused by stress interference (such as the LibriSpeech test set WER reaching 13.38%) and low accuracy of speech animation synchronization. Moreover, this study proposes an innovative diarticulation model, which quantifies the co-articulation effect through a consonant-vowel/vowel-vowel visual weight function and optimizes the mouth shape parameters through a dynamic feedback mechanism. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the recognition performance of the model, with an F1 value of 0.91 and a domain matching dataset CER of 6–8.5%. The pronunciation correction effect is outstanding, with a 43% reduction in vowel error rate (23.1% → 13.2%) and a 38.5% improvement in consonant connection accuracy. In addition, the synchronization delay is reduced by 15.3% (
            p
            &lt; 0.001) compared to PhoneBERT, and the DTW distance is only 0.18. The conclusion shows that the system effectively solves the problem of speech recognition generalization through data adaptive training and dual pronunciation modeling. At the same time, the synchronization accuracy and real-time performance (48FPS) have reached a practical level, providing a reliable technical solution for intelligent oral training.},

  abstract = {With the growth of the film market, users are often overwhelmed by irrelevant information, making it difficult to make accurate movie choices. To address this, we propose an improved deep structured semantic model (DSSM) movie recommendation algorithm based on Spark technology. The algorithm employs two DSSMs: one to extract users’ long-term preferences and another for final movie recommendations. The preference model integrates explicit and implicit user interaction features, while the recommendation model utilizes recent viewing history and search behavior. Experiments were conducted on the MovieLens 100K and MovieLens 1M datasets, using metrics such as accuracy, recall, mean reciprocal ranking (MRR), diversity, and normalized discounted cumulative return (NDCG). The results show that the improved algorithm outperforms others in recall, with rates of 36.0% and 42.1% for the top 40 recommendations on the MovieLens 100K and 1M datasets, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm’s NDCG scores for the top 10 recommendations were 0.525 and 0.554, higher than those of competing algorithms. The system, built on Spark technology, passes all performance tests, with an average response time of under 600 ms. These results demonstrate that the proposed DSSM-based movie recommendation algorithm can provide accurate recommendations while overcoming the challenge of data sparsity. The research not only provides an efficient and accurate solution for the field of movie recommendation, but also shows the significant advantages of Spark technology in processing large-scale data sets, which has a wide range of application value and promotion prospects.},

  abstract = {Objective:
            The new drug KarXT targets muscarinic receptors to reduce the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Haloperidol is effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, while sulpiride has shown modest efficacy in alleviating negative symptoms. The shared and distinct molecular mechanisms of these drugs are unclear. This study aimed to determine if the mechanism for KarXT overlaps with the benefits of haloperidol for positive symptoms and sulpiride for negative symptoms.
          
          
            Methods:
            The putative target genes for the three drugs were identified, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify core targets. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses of the top 20 core targets were conducted. A drug-pathway-target-disease network was constructed.
          
          
            Results:
            The search yielded 179 common targets for haloperidol against positive symptoms, 96 targets for sulpiride against negative symptoms, and 99 targets for KarXT against schizophrenia. Haloperidol affects positive symptoms by targeting the IL-17 signaling pathway via TNF, IL6, IL1B, MAPK3, and CASP3, and sulpiride affects negative symptoms by targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway via BDNF, INS, AKT1, IGF1, and BCL2. KarXT affects schizophrenia by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway via AKT1, FOS, CASP3, NFKB1, and IGF1. Molecular docking revealed good binding affinities between the drugs and the potential core targets.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            This study provides insights into the distinct molecular mechanisms by which haloperidol and sulpiride affect distinct symptoms of schizophrenia. KarXT integrates the partial effects of both drugs, including CASP3 with haloperidol and AKT1 and IGF1 with sulpiride. Our results provide a theoretical basis for clinical applications and new directions for drug development.},

The system utilizes zero-knowledge proof to verify the identity of the voter, while ensuring the tamperability of the voting data through blockchain technology. The experimental results indicated that the system outperformed the existing schemes in terms of processing speed and verification efficiency. Specifically, when the number of voters was 200, the time consuming and single verification time of this system were 3.7 s and 6.4 ms, respectively. When the number of voters increased to 600, the time consuming and single verification time were 8.3 s and 13.3 ms, respectively. In the number of candidates/voters was 5/80, none of the system’s gas consumption exceeded the maximum limit of a single transaction in Ether. Among them, the gas consumption of Vote Control contract was 5577485, and the gas consumption of non-interactive zero knowledge contract was 3826753. Furthermore, the more candidates there were, the longer it took the system to operate, although the number of voters had less of an effect on the cost of operating the voter system.

In practical applications, the air compressor of the fuel cell system will be affected by the frequency and amplitude of changes in the air load. To effectively solve this problem, this study proposes and evaluates the control algorithm of fuel cell air compressors considering the characteristics of air load. Firstly, a control model of the fuel cell air compressor system including air load and back pressure valve model is established. Secondly, the input–output feedback linearization (IOFL) theory is adopted to globally linearize the control model of the fuel cell air compressor system. Finally, the Q-axis current of the improved speed loop is generated through the feedback of the air state quantity to correct the output torque of the air compressor. The simulation results show that this method ensures the accuracy of the model while achieving precise control of the rotational speed, effectively improving the adaptability and dynamic response performance of the air compressor, and guaranteeing the stability and efficiency of the fuel cell system.},

  abstract = {Traditional online advertising evaluation indicators (e.g., click-through rate and conversion rate) are characterized by limitations in scope and delayed feedback, rendering them inadequate for real-time and comprehensive evaluation. The existing models have insufficient accuracy when fusing multiple features. Therefore, the research proposes an evaluation framework that integrates multimodal features (MF) with attribute integration for user classification and constructs a cascading model based on MF and timing features (TC). The classification of user types is achieved through the attribute integration method, which utilizes multi-source data, including cognitive styles and emotional states. Quantification of features is facilitated by employing membership functions. The cascade model involves combining Markov chains and the PrefixSpan algorithm to mine temporal patterns. The results showed that when the user type was 2, the cluster center distances were (1.3, 0.9), and the type differences were significant. Under the activation of ReLU, the Auc of the cascade model was 0.803 and the logloss was 0.45. Under tanh activation, Auc = 0.795 and logloss = 0.452. The evaluation accuracy rate of the cascade model from 18:00 to 22:00 can reach up to 0.99 at most.

  abstract = {Lane line boundary detection algorithms primarily rely on camera-acquired image data for accurate recognition. However, during image acquisition, distortions caused by glass refraction and the inherent imaging principles of the camera can compromise the precision of lane line detection. To enhance the precision of road environment perception, this study first conducts a comprehensive camera calibration to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, which serve as the basis for subsequent geometric distortion correction of the acquired images. Subsequently, Otsu’s method is employed for binary segmentation of lane images, and Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) is utilized to transform the perspective and extract precise lane line boundary coordinates. The eight-neighborhood boundary tracking algorithm is then employed to track lane lines, improving image processing speed while reducing false positives and false negatives. Finally, the Least Squares Method is utilized to fit the extracted boundary points of the lane lines, thereby constructing an accurate mathematical model for lane representation. The experiment was conducted using multi-element lane lines as the test platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves nearly a fivefold improvement in detection speed compared to the method without inverse perspective transformation. The Intersection over Union (IoU) between the extracted lane lines and the ground truth reaches 0.88, approaching the ideal value of 1.0. The pixel-level accuracy of lane line extraction is 93.7%, and the recall rate, representing the proportion of correctly extracted lane line pixels, is 95.2%. Furthermore, the balanced F1-score, which evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall, reaches 0.98, indicating excellent overall performance. Additionally, it exhibited superior robustness. These findings suggest that this method can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lane line detection in complex road environments, thereby providing reliable technical support for intelligent driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).},

  abstract = {At present, it is difficult to fully cover the actual needs of use in the actual renovation planning of old residential areas, which affects the implementation of the renovation. In order to improve the quality of renovation planning for old residential areas, a method based on the demand priority model was studied and designed. The process of establishing a model includes two aspects: content system and requirement priority decision-making method system. A specific list of transformation contents was constructed, expert interviews were conducted to improve the rationality of the transformation contents, and a decision-making system was proposed. The corresponding original decision matrix calculation method was established. When carrying out renovation planning, first identify the requirements and collect data, then build a model and classify it, and calculate the score to rank the requirements. The experimental results show that in the four quadrants established by the model, when the importance score is below 3.75, the various indicators are mainly located in quadrant 2. When the importance score exceeds 3.75, most indicators are located in the priority improvement zone, and a few indicators are located in the over concern zone and the lower value zone. The maximum distance between the transformation requirement and the positive ideal solution is 0.677 and 0.691, the minimum is 0.069 and 0.062, and the final score is 0.909. The research method can effectively assist in the planning of community renovation, and theoretically has high rationality and practicality in practical applications.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) transforms second language acquisition by immersing learners in interactive, context-rich environments that foster cognitive engagement and enhance phonemic competence. This research explores the neurocognitive enhancements induced by VR-based English phoneme learning through multimodal bio-signal analysis and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. A total of 450 English learners participated in immersive VR scenarios designed to target challenging English phonemes within authentic conversational tasks. Two types of datasets were collected: one in the form of a CSV file containing EEG signals and eye-tracking data, and the other comprising audio signal data. EEG and eye-tracking data were preprocessed using Z-score normalization to ensure consistency. Audio data were denoised using the Savitzky–Golay filter, which effectively preserves phonetic information while removing environmental noise. The cleaned data were fed into the feature extraction process. For the EEG and eye-tracking data, feature extraction was carried out using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), while Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the audio data to capture detailed phonetic features essential for phoneme classification. This approach ensures accurate classification of phonemic performance and prediction of neurocognitive load in immersive VR-based phoneme learning. A feature-level fusion technique was employed to integrate the normalized event-log features and audio-based MFCCs into a unified, high-dimensional feature space, enabling comprehensive multimodal analysis. The Manta Ray Foraging Optimized Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (MRFO-LGBM) was introduced to optimize the LGBM model, enabling accurate classification of phonemic performance and prediction of neurocognitive load. The proposed method was implemented using Python 3.10.1. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed VR-enhanced cognitive phoneme recognition framework significantly outperforms other models, achieving superior results in terms of accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, with all metrics ranging from 95% to 96% in predicting neurocognitive states during immersive language acquisition. This research introduces a novel, scalable VR-based system that integrates bio-signal fusion and intelligent modeling to deliver personalized, measurable improvements in phonemic competence.},

  abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving global economy, the skills required by employers are constantly changing, placing increasing pressure on educational institutions to keep their curriculum relevant and responsive. Yet, academic programs comprising structured offerings like degrees, diplomas, and certificates frequently face challenges in adapting promptly to the changing demands of the labor market. This lag often leads to a sustained disconnect between the skills students acquire and those sought by employers. To address this challenge, this research introduces an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven framework that leverages a Spatially-Aware Attention Long Short-Term Memory (SA-LSTM) architecture to harmonize academic curriculum with labor market trends. The framework processes two primary datasets: academic data, including curriculum outlines, course descriptions, student performance records, and labor market data, derived from online job postings, government employment reports, and industry white papers. The data undergoes a rigorous pre-processing pipeline, including cleaning, tokenization, and embedding using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to extract relevant features and feature-level fusion combines the features. The SA-LSTM model is the core of the system, incorporating spatial attention mechanisms to identify and model curriculum content and shifting skill requirements in the labor market. By leveraging the use of the attention mechanism, the model identifies contextual constraints in academic content and labor market trends to enable the identification of gaps in skills and new industry requirements. The SA-LSTM model generates curriculum recommendations from these results, suggesting new course modules, course modifications, and has better performance in accuracy with 96.2%, in comparison to baseline methods. This SA-LSTM offers a dynamic, data-driven solution to curriculum engineering, enabling schools to continuously adapt to the evolving needs of the job market.},

  abstract = {As public power grids expand, utility providers face increasing challenges in managing vast inventories of infrastructure assets. Effective asset prioritization and disposal planning are critical to maintaining system reliability, minimizing operational risks, and optimizing financial performance. This research introduces a robust data-driven framework for asset prioritization and disposal planning by integrating advanced analytics and optimization techniques. Diverse datasets are collected, including asset condition reports, maintenance logs, operational performance data, failure records, and environmental parameters. Data preprocessing uses Z-score normalization to scale numerical features and handle anomalies, while missing values are treated using appropriate imputation methods to maintain dataset integrity. Asset prioritization is assessed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), enabling structured multi-criteria decision-making based on factors such as failure impact, maintenance cost, and system importance. Natural Gradient Boosting (NGB) is employed to forecast asset degradation and estimate failure probability and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with high accuracy. These predictive insights formed the basis for prioritizing assets for replacement or disposal. A Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) is developed to optimize disposal schedules and support long-term planning within operational and financial constraints. This approach balances budget limitations with criticality and RUL outputs to generate efficient replacement strategies. Integrating AHP, NGB, and PGA within a unified decision-support system highlights the potential of hybrid analytical models in modernizing public infrastructure management. The results show that the hybrid approach performs significantly better than traditional approaches in terms of System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI). This approach supports proactive maintenance, reduces systemic risks, and enhances the overall resilience and performance of power distribution networks.},

  abstract = {In higher education, efficient feedback systems are essential for preserving and improving educational quality. However, higher education institutions continuously struggle to recover quality assessment processes by incorporating student feedback and academic data, also in delays, bias, and inadequacies in gaining valuable insights are common problems with traditional feedback methods. The primary concern lies in the manual processing of large, unstructured feedback datasets, leading to unnoticed issues and delayed interventions. To address this problem, the research goal is to design an Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework to automate, improve, and optimize feedback analysis for educational quality assessment. The data was collected through learning management system (LMS) activity logs, including student responses, participation rates, and academic performance records. Z-score normalization and missing value imputation were used as data preparation approaches to manage missing values and scale features consistently. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) was used to process text data to extract features efficiently. The research employs an Adaptive Butterfly-Attention Mechanism Generative Adversarial Network (AB-Att-GAN). The AB and Attention module uses a GAN design to produce refined feedback patterns, focusing on significant feedback features across scales. This method helps interpret student concerns, aligns teaching practices dynamically, and allows early intervention strategies, ensuring quality and relevance. Experimental outcomes using Python showed that the AB-Att-GAN framework attains superior performance when compared to conventional deep learning (DL) models, achieving 98.5% accuracy. Additionally, the technology provides tailored feedback loops and forecast insights for early academic intervention. The AB-Att-GAN architecture displays a greater capacity for evolving high quality, real-time educational feedback systems and promoting continuous institutional development.},

  abstract = {Choral music, as a collective art form, achieves harmonious and rich musical effects through multi-voice coordination and cooperation. However, sound balance issues often affect the quality of choir singing. Traditional methods mainly rely on subjective adjustments by conductors and vocal teachers, lacking consistency, objectivity, and adaptability. To address this issue, this article proposed a choir sound balance optimization model based on simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The experiment included sound data collection, environmental characteristic measurement, and evaluation index setting, which verified the effectiveness of this method in dealing with different voice parts and complex environmental factors. The outcomes demonstrated that the simulated annealing algorithm significantly reduced the standard deviation of the volume and frequency of each voice and improved the balance of the volume and frequency. In all scenarios, the volume standard deviation of the simulated annealing adjustment method was smaller or equal to the standard deviation of the conventional adjustment method. The standard deviation of the simulated annealing adjustment method was always the lowest among all voice parts and time windows. The average frequency standard deviation of the four voice parts decreased by 51.21% and 31.70% in indoor environments, 52.10% and 30.96% in semi-open environments, and 49.25% and 29.49% in outdoor environments, respectively. The subjective evaluation results of users further verified the effectiveness of the model, and various listeners gave high ratings to the adjusted volume balance and overall sound quality. This indicates that the method has broad application potential and can cope with diverse practical performance environments. The research results of this article provide a scientific sound balance optimization tool for choir groups, which can help choir conductors and sound engineers achieve higher levels of sound balance and harmony in actual performances.},

How to accurately extract emotional information from numerous images has become an essential issue in computer vision. To achieve high-precision image emotion classification, this study proposes a polarity-aware attention mechanism for both negative and positive coarse-grained sentiment classifications. Among them, polarity perception refers to the perception and classification of the binary polarity (positive/negative) of image emotions, while supporting fine-grained emotional intensity evaluation. At the same time, a classification network combining polarity-aware attention module and Transformer is introduced to achieve fine-grained emotion classification containing eight emotions. The results showed that the proposed polarity-aware attention mechanism classification method had an average accuracy of 95.88%, an average recall rate of 94.94%, and an average F1-value of 95.62% on the Twitter I binary sentiment classification dataset. In the ArtPhoto eight emotion classification datasets, the fusion of polarity-aware attention module and Transformer classification network achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.23% and the lowest accuracy of 96.14% for the eight emotions. The highest classification accuracy of the weighted spatial context network was only 89.01%. The results indicate that the proposed image sentiment classification technique has achieved significant performance advantages in both coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification tasks.

Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was employed to examine the lipophilicity of the silylated derivatives of piroxicam. Due to the non-polar nature of the column used in this device and the polarity of piroxicam and its derivatives, the retention time of silylated derivatives was longer in the column compared to the original piroxicam, due to the inherent nature of these materials which have high non polar properties. The results show an acceptable increase in the lipophilicity of the silylated derivatives compared to piroxicam. To evaluate the hydrophobic properties of drugs e.g., piroxicam and the silyl derivatives of piroxicam, the distribution of the species around the drugs were investigated in a Water/Octanol mixture using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Results of the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and continuous hydrogen bond networks suggest a favorable interaction between Octanol molecules and the silyl derivatives of piroxicam compared to piroxicam.},

Firstly, RepConv and DBB reparameterization modules are introduced to enhance the ability of multi-scale feature fusion and solve the problem of large scale difference of visual objects. A centralized intra-layer adjustment feature pyramid network is designed, which combines the deformable attention mechanism and CASPPF in a parallel way. The pyramid network is globally centralized adjusted in a top–down manner, and the spatial weight of the global representation in the network is increased, so that the improved algorithm can obtain comprehensive and discriminative feature representation. The cross-entropy loss function is replaced by the exponential sliding sample weighting function (EMA‐SlideLoss) to enhance the classification ability of the model and improve the stability of training. Using these methods, we propose an improved model RDE-YOLOv8-Pose model. The experimental results show that compared with the YOLOv8-Pose model, this research method improves mAP@0.5 by 0.142 and achieves a detection speed of 47.4 frames/s.

The study obtains the optimal value of data feature vectors through particle swarm optimization algorithm and uses long-short term memory prediction model to predict and classify feature signals. In addition, the study uses the binning method to denoise the collected data and normalizes the denoised data so that each feature data was distributed between 0 and 1. The results showed that the fitting between actual values and predicted values was good.

This indicated that the warning model designed by the research had good performance. The combination of the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the long short-term memory network model offered unique advantages in the medical field. The particle swarm optimization algorithm could efficiently identify key features, avoid local optima, and improve the model’s generalization ability.

This study introduces a novel recognition framework, termed CNN BiLSTM + QAN, designed specifically for the identification of minor faults and attacks in power systems. The proposed network employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract salient features from fault signals and integrates the Quantum Attention Network (QAN) into a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, thereby constructing a BiLSTM + QAN recognition network that significantly enhances the characterization and recognition capabilities of localized fault signal features. To mitigate the influence of anomalous noise, the loss function is formulated using Cross Entropy Loss, and gradient-based optimization techniques are employed to achieve global convergence of the network, further augmenting its efficacy in detecting minor faults. Utilizing simulated data of minor faults from the IEEE 14-bus system, comparative experiments demonstrate that the CNN BiLSTM + QAN framework developed in this study effectively recognizes minor faults, achieving an impressive recognition accuracy of 98.34%.},

To address low accuracy and complex networks in traditional algorithms for human motion posture recognition, this study proposes a method based on particle swarm optimization to improve the backpropagation neural network for recognizing and analyzing human motion posture. The model first extracts key nodes from image data through improved OpenPose, performs viewpoint transformation, and uses an optimized backpropagation neural network to recognize relevant human postures. The experiments showed that the improved OpenPose algorithm had high accuracy in extracting key nodes. When the viewing angle was 108°, the error value generated by viewing angle conversion was the smallest and the accuracy was the highest. The Schaffer function of the backpropagation neural network model optimized by particle swarm optimization and small batch gradient descent converged after 60 and 99 iterations, respectively. The Griebank function converged after 78 and 98 iterations. The particle swarm optimization-based backpropagation neural network achieved an average improvement of 20%, 22%, 16%, and 12% in recognition rates for four different human motion postures compared to other algorithms.

This study conducts numerical simulations on L-shaped frames subjected to frequent earthquakes to investigate the influence of low-frequency content on the torsional responses of planar irregular frame structures (PIFSs). Five L-shaped frame models with varying length-to-width ratios (L/B) of the protruding limbs-1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, and 3:1 were developed using ABAQUS. Columns were modeled using solid elements, reinforcing steel with truss elements, and floor slabs with shell elements. The peak shear forces and bending moments in corner columns were compared under various conditions of low-frequency content to analyze the effects of low-frequency content and L/B ratios on wave passage effect in frames. The results indicate that when the low-frequency content of seismic waves is sufficient, wave passage effect occurs in outer corner columns, whereas inner corner columns remain unaffected. At apparent wave velocity of 2000 m/s, increasing L/B ratios amplify peak shear forces and bending moments in wave-facing outer corner columns by 28.3% and 43.8%, respectively. Conversely, when the low-frequency content of seismic waves is insufficient, neither outer nor inner corner columns exhibit wave passage effect.},

In response to this, the research proposes the Dilated Convolution-Attention-Stacked Hourglass Network Pose Estimation (MS-DConv-Att-SHN) to achieve martial arts action recognition. Firstly, multiple dilated convolutions and mixed attention are proposed to improve the computational complexity and loss of joint information in stacked hourglass networks, enhancing the ability to capture subtle joint displacements. This is crucial for accurate estimation of complex poses such as movement, flicker, and virtual real transformations in martial arts. Secondly, in response to the strong coherence of martial arts movements, local feature refinement and channel fusion techniques are used to enhance the correlation analysis between consecutive action frames, solving the problem of traditional methods’ fragmented recognition of action chains such as “exertion contraction.” A martial arts action recognition system based on the improved MS-DConv-Att-SHN method has been developed to better identify individual movements and capture the intrinsic relationships between movements in routines. This provides key technical support for the digital inheritance, intelligent evaluation, and standardized promotion of martial arts, making it more closely aligned with the movement characteristics of martial arts that combine form and spirit. The results indicate that structural improvements to the stacked hourglass network can effectively increase its percentage of correct keypoints (PCK) and mean average precision (mAP) for both datasets, with PCK and mAP values exceeding 92% and 85%, respectively. The average recognition accuracy of attitude keypoints in the MS-DConv-Att-SHN model is superior to other comparison models, with a difference of over 1.2% compared to other models. The improved MS-DConv-Att-SHN model achieves recognition accuracy of over 90% for different martial arts movements, showing smaller parameter counts and PCK values compared to other comparative models.

  abstract = {Smart elderly care systems often struggle with accurate anomaly detection and health trend prediction due to the multi-source heterogeneity and high noise characteristics of health data. Existing methods face limitations in handling structural differences across data sources and capturing task correlations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning (MTL) with support vector machines (SVMs). Health data are collected from smart wearable devices, electronic medical records, and environmental monitoring sensors. Following data cleaning and normalization, an MTL framework is constructed to extract shared representations between anomaly detection and health trend prediction tasks. An SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed for robust anomaly detection in high-dimensional data. Additionally, a hierarchical prediction mechanism is developed to dynamically forecast health trends using shared features and classification boundaries. Experimental evaluations on a real-world smart elderly care dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an anomaly detection accuracy of 97% and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.12 in health trend prediction. These results confirm the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the analysis of complex health data, offering a promising solution for intelligent data processing in elderly care applications.},

  abstract = {The structural design of fixed flexible fall protection devices often relies on single-objective optimization methods, leading to uneven stress distribution and local stress concentration, which compromise long-term safety and durability. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-objective optimization framework integrating the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with finite element analysis (FEA). Key structural parameters influencing load-bearing capacity, stress distribution, and deformation control are identified, forming the basis of a multi-objective optimization model aimed at maximizing bearing capacity, minimizing stress concentration, and optimizing deformation uniformity. To enhance computational efficiency, a Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based surrogate model is developed to approximate FEA results, while parallel computing accelerates population evaluation in NSGA-II. Candidate solutions are validated through FEA simulations, followed by further refinement using adaptive crossover-mutation and local search strategies. The optimized design demonstrates significant performance improvements: average bearing capacity reaches 172.88 kN, with node displacement reduced to 0.97 mm. Deformation gradient uniformity improves to 0.06, and residual deformation ratio decreases to 2.49%. These results confirm that the NSGA-II and FEA-integrated approach effectively enhances mechanical performance and structural reliability.

  abstract = {In this study, we analyze the behavior of a damped parametric oscillator, incorporating a damping factor to examine its influence on system dynamics. We derive the equation of motion using the Lagrangian formulation and the Euler–Lagrange equation, which leads to a nonlinear differential equation governing the system’s motion. The equation is solved numerically using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method and analytically using the Multistep Differential Transformation Method (MS-DTM), which provides an efficient and accurate approximation. The results obtained from MS-DTM are in good agreement with the numerical solutions, demonstrating its capability to capture the system’s dynamics with reduced computational effort. By analyzing two distinct scenarios—one with a small damping coefficient (β = 0.01) and the other with a larger damping coefficient (β = 0.5)—we observe that the damping parameter significantly influences system behavior. Specifically, in the first scenario, the system exhibits stable damped harmonic motion with constant energy, while in the second scenario, the system experiences energy dissipation and becomes unstable. This study highlights the critical role of damping in determining the system’s stability and energy dissipation, showcasing the effectiveness of both MS-DTM and numerical methods in analyzing nonlinear oscillatory systems.},

However, due to the wireless signal in the process of indoor transmission will have a certain attenuation. Therefore, there will be some errors in these positioning algorithms. In this paper, the positioning error is reduced by filtering out the equipment information with large error, and then an improved multi circle positioning algorithm is proposed based on the three circle positioning. At the same time, the weighted centroid algorithm is added to the improved positioning algorithm, which can effectively improve the positioning accuracy. Compared with the traditional positioning algorithm, the improved positioning algorithm can limit the positioning error within 4 m. Compared with the traditional location algorithm, this algorithm is more stable. Finally, the paper gives the experimental simulation of the improved algorithm. With the help of Ibeacon equipment, the system obtains the distance between the current position and Ibeacon anchor.

The research included bending tests (ASTM D7264), nanoindentation, and multiscale computational homogenization to describe the mechanical behavior across scales. SiC doping was applied at 1.5%, 3%, and 5% by weight, using two fiberglass configurations: continuous laminates and a mixed arrangement of continuous and discontinuous laminates, with 13 fiberglass layers per sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyzed porosity and SiC distribution at the interface, while nanoindentation tests examined the matrix, fibers, SiC particles, and their interfaces. Long laminate stacking provided the best mechanical performance due to uniform reinforcement distribution at the fiber/matrix interface. Increasing the SiC content in long laminates improved flexural strength by 17.5% compared to undoped samples. In contrast, mixed laminates exhibited a 41% strength reduction due to SiC particle agglomeration and stress concentrations. Bending curves of SiC-doped samples showed three stiffness zones, attributed to hierarchical mechanical behavior with progressive reinforcement activation. The large SiC particle size and low fraction enhanced deformation capacity below 50 MPa while increasing flexural strength. This balance of strength and deformation represents a novel finding in composite performance.},

  abstract = {Background
            Lactoferrin (LTF), a conserved glycoprotein, plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis, oxidative stress management, and anti-inflammatory responses. Its high iron-binding affinity and protective actions make it a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, characterized by oxidative damage and disrupted metal homeostasis.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed to modulate LTFs activity, providing a cost-effective therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.
          
          
            Methods
            We employed molecular docking to screen a library of ∼3500 FDA-approved drugs for binding affinity to LTF. Drug profiling and PASS analysis were used to predict biological activities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations evaluated the stability of LTF-drug complexes, with key parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, and hydrogen bonding assessed. Principal component analysis and free energy landscape mapping further explored protein-ligand interactions and conformational stability.
          
          
            Results
            Ten drugs with high binding affinities were identified, among which Mosapramine and Quinupramine emerged as promising candidates based on their drug profiling and PASS activities. These drugs demonstrated stable binding to LTFs iron-binding pocket, as confirmed by MD simulations. Drug profiling indicated neuroprotective properties, including anti-inflammatory and cognitive-enhancing activities. PCA and free energy analyses revealed conformational stability of the LTF-drug complexes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            This study highlights Mosapramine and Quinupramine as potential modulators of LTF for neurodegenerative diseases. The findings underscore the efficacy of computational screening in repurposing drugs, paving the way for further experimental validation and therapeutic development.},

  abstract = {The integration of wind power into extensive grid networks presents a confluence of challenges arising from the inherently intermittent nature of wind resources and transmission bottlenecks. To address these complexities and maximize wind energy utilization while meeting demand requirements, a holistic planning paradigm is indispensable. Such an approach entails the synergistic coordination of wind power capacity allocation and siting, expansion of transmission infrastructure, and integration of energy storage systems. Additionally, operational strategies for both generation assets and energy storage facilities play pivotal roles in optimizing system performance. A joint planning framework is formulated to minimize the aggregate costs associated with transmission network augmentation, energy storage system deployment and operation, conventional unit dispatch, wind curtailment, and penalties incurred during periods of high demand. This model incorporates linearized representations of constraints governing energy storage system planning and operation and quadratic generation cost functions, facilitated by Mixed-Integer Linear Programming methodologies. Rigorous evaluation of the proposed methodology is conducted utilizing representative test systems across diverse scenario settings. The empirical findings underscore the efficacy of the devised planning model in significantly bolstering load acceptance capacity and facilitating heightened levels of wind power integration within the grid infrastructure.},

Firstly, adaptive elite and mutation strategies are used to improve the population quality and global development performance of MVO algorithm. Secondly, WEP and TDR parameter updating mechanism based on nonlinear curve change is designed to balance the convergence process of MVO algorithm in the early and late iterations. Finally, SMA algorithm is introduced to further improve the solving ability and solution quality of the improved MVO algorithm. In addition, the adaptive multi-DG switching function and high fault tolerance evaluation function are constructed, and a dynamic partition processing method suitable for active distribution network is introduced, which effectively reduces the dimension of the algorithm solution. The comparison experimental results of MVO, IMVO, SMA, and SMVO algorithms in the simulation examples of single point, multi-point, and information distortion faults of IEEE33-node active distribution network show that compared with the other three algorithms, the SMVO algorithm has higher local exploration ability and iterative stability, and the positioning accuracy reaches 100%.

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of electricity load time series is crucial for optimizing power system scheduling and ensuring reliable operation. However, existing approaches face challenges in effectively capturing long-term global trends while addressing short-term local fluctuations. This study proposes a hybrid strategy that integrates the Mamba algorithm for long-term predictions with the Transformer model for short-term forecasting, leveraging the complementary strengths of both methods. The Mamba algorithm captures global trends in long-term sequences, while the Transformer focuses on local variations in short-term data. This combination enhances both long-term trend accuracy and the detection of short-term fluctuations. Additionally, a robust sequence decomposition module is introduced to refine the sliding window mechanism, which segments long sequences for Transformer input, thereby reducing computational overhead and memory demands. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms both standalone Mamba and Transformer models in prediction precision, computational efficiency, and memory optimization. Specifically, compared to Mamba, the hybrid model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 37%, and compared to Transformer, it achieves an 11% reduction in MSE. Additionally, the training time is shortened by 34%, and GPU memory usage is reduced by 47%. These findings confirm that the proposed strategy effectively integrates the advantages of Mamba and Transformer, achieving reliable long-term load forecasting alongside robust short-term prediction capabilities. The model’s efficacy has been validated using real-world power load datasets from Sichuan Province, China, covering the period from 2022 to July 2024.},

To address the above problems, the study proposes a dynamic demand and inventory prediction model for cross-border e-commerce based on differential autoregressive integrated moving average model and long short-term memory. This can optimize the timing of demand prediction and reduce the cost of inventory management, and finally set up experiments to verify it. The experimental results show that in the simulation running experiments, the average demand forecasting efficiency of the proposed model before training is 50.70%, and it is improved to 97.56% after training; the average inventory control accuracy of the model after training reaches 0.94, and the average deviation of accuracy is 0.009. After the model loses the demand forecasting module the demand forecasting efficiency decreases to 84.43%, and the inventory control accuracy decreases to 0.84. After the model loses the inventory management module the average demand forecasting efficiency decreases to 93.86%, and the inventory control accuracy decreases to 0.933. After losing the inventory management module, the demand forecasting efficiency drops to 93.86%, and the inventory control accuracy drops to 0.933.

  abstract = {A crucial aspect of creating character images in digital media is ensuring that animated characters’ details and distinctive features are accurately aligned. Additionally, facial animation contour feature matching and seamless splicing are essential for conveying precise facial expressions, making them key technologies in the creation of animated characters. Traditional facial motion capture technology makes it difficult for the audience to experience the character’s expressions. Low matching accuracy, low stitching efficiency, and severe image distortion after stitching are just a few of the issues that need to be addressed. An animation-based face contour feature matching method is proposed in this paper to address the issues raised above. Training a neural network with images of faces and animation characters is the first step in matching the datasets. Then, a Gaussian low-pass filter is used to scale and denoise the complex animation image in the scene. By using the double threshold method, a smooth image’s contour is detected, and the contour feature is extracted and a matching relationship is built. Finally, the facial key point bone parameters are used in conjunction with the face geometry correction. The best matching pair of faces is selected for image contour stitching based on a qualitative analysis of character expressions. The results of the simulation show that it has better feature matching accuracy, shorter running time, and stronger anti-distortion ability than the traditional stitching method, which greatly helps to improve the efficiency of animation manufacturing and increase the output.},

The evaluation of the inhibitors’ effectiveness for protecting mild steel was conducted using the weight loss method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the Tafel method. The surface characteristics of the metal coupons were characterised using surface characterisation techniques (scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy). The hydrophobic properties of the inhibitors were evaluated by means of contact angle. Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Frumkin's isothermal models were used to study inhibitor adsorption properties. The best fit was obtained for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adsorption process is a mixed type rather than physisorption or chemisorption. The inhibitor PPMTU exhibits the maximum inhibition efficiency of 99% by the weight loss method and 98% by the Tafel method at a concentration of just 90 µM. Notably, this is the first work to attain this high inhibition efficiency at a remarkably very low concentration of inhibitor, indicating that a very small amount is sufficient to control the corrosion process by up to 99%. The experimental data are validated using computational methods. The results are promising.},

  abstract = {In the communication systems of intelligent micro-grids, the intrinsic security of the physical layer is insufficient, with high computational complexity and poor robustness. To address these issues, a beamforming algorithm based on deep learning and successive convex approximation (DL-SCA) is proposed. Initially, under the premise that the norm of channel estimation error is bounded, a secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated. A deep neural network is employed to learn the intricate mapping between channel state information (CSI) and the optimal beamforming matrix, facilitating the extraction of profound channel features. Subsequently, building upon the initial solution obtained, the beamforming precoding optimization problem is further solved using the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Ultimately, through the Monte Carlo experiment based on imperfect CSI, the security performance and convergence speed of different algorithms are compared. In comparison with the zero forcing (ZF) beamforming algorithm, there is an approximate 20% increase in the system secrecy rate; and when compared with the traditional SCA algorithm, there is a reduction of about 10% in the execution time. This substantiates that the DL-SCA algorithm can effectively enhance the intrinsic security performance of the micro-grid, with high robustness and rapid convergence.},

Because of taking state variables from the model, the system’s resilience against disturbances is notably strengthened. In contrast to the augmentation error signal design method, this approach allows for the derivation of the adaptive control law without the need for an augmentation error signal. Consequently, there is a reduction in the number of adjustable parameters, and the elimination of a set of filters significantly simplifies the system structure, rendering it more amenable to engineering implementation. This streamlined approach promises enhanced efficiency and ease of deployment in practical applications.},

  abstract = {In the face of increasingly complex and multi-phase construction projects, traditional scheduling methods struggle to account for uncertainties commonly encountered on construction sites—such as sudden weather changes, delayed material deliveries, and fluctuating labor availability. These unpredictable factors often lead to significant discrepancies between actual progress and the original schedule. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid construction progress optimization scheduling model that combines the A* algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA), referred to as the A*-GA model. This approach leverages the heuristic search capability of the A* algorithm and the global optimization power of GA. The A*-GA model first employs the A* algorithm to generate an initial construction schedule, prioritizing candidate solutions to identify the most efficient task execution path and ensure rational allocation of time and resources. This preliminary plan is then further refined using GA. Through customized encoding schemes, fitness functions, and genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation, the model iteratively evolves better scheduling solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the A*-GA model significantly improves project efficiency, reducing the overall construction period by 59 days and cutting costs by 1.501 million yuan. The proposed model proves effective in optimizing both time and cost, offering a more intelligent and adaptive solution for construction progress management in complex engineering environments.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty in the demand and supply of social public resources leads to increased competition, which increases the complexity and collaboration cost of resource allocation. Therefore, this paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to optimize the dynamic allocation mechanism of social public resources. Firstly, considering the problem of partial loss of information due to environmental unobservability in a multi-intelligent body environment, a MARL algorithm based on prophet-guided (MADRLPG) is proposed. On this basis, a flexible overlapping organization framework under spatio-temporal constraints is constructed. In addition, a dynamic resource allocation algorithm under spatio-temporal constraints is proposed to solve the unbalanced use of resources; meanwhile, a collaborative strategy generation algorithm is proposed to reduce resource competition. Finally, the simulation results show that the resource utilization rate of the proposed method is 97%, which can effectively alleviate the resource constraint problem.},

  abstract = {The significance of instrument recognition based on audio signals lies in its broad potential across diverse fields such as music education, intelligent technology, and even medical diagnosis. In this study, we focus on tackling the challenges posed by the OpenMIC-2018 (Open Museum Identification Challenge-2018) dataset. Leveraging the powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the research aims to address common interference factors in instrument recognition, such as background noise, pitch variations, and volume fluctuations during performances. By effectively mitigating these challenges, this approach enhances the accuracy and precision of instrument recognition, offering valuable contributions to both academic research and practical applications. Firstly, FFT (fast Fourier transform) is used to extract MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient), chroma, time-domain, and spectral energy from each audio frame. Initial CNN models with 10 different hyperparameters are trained, and the prediction results are merged with the original features. Then, one-dimensional convolutional layers are used for spectral feature convolution operations, and pooling layers are used for downsampling. ReLU (rectified linear unit) is used as the activation function and nonlinearity is applied. Dropout layers are added between convolutional layers and a portion of neurons are randomly set to zero. Next, the learning rate is adjusted based on cross-validation. For multi-label classification tasks, a binary cross-entropy loss is used and parameters are updated through backpropagation algorithm. Finally, a secondary CNN model is used. The merged features are input and the prediction results are obtained. The research results indicate that the innovative method used achieves an average accuracy of 0.92 on OpenMIC-2018, with an accuracy of 0.97 for accordion, flute, and organ, realizing relatively precise instrument recognition.},

A cumulative reward normalised score comparison experiment and a learning rate sensitivity analysis experiment show that the model works best at a medium learning rate (0.01) and that it reaches its highest cumulative reward score during the training period of 25,000 to 35,000 steps.

  abstract = {The social sciences and humanities have increasingly adopted computational terminology as the organizing categories for inquiry. We argue that by organizing research around vernacular computational objects (e.g. data, algorithms, or AI) and divided worldly domains (e.g. finance, health, and governance), scholars risk obscuring the universalizing practices and ambitions of computation. These practices seek to establish new relationalities at unprecedented scales, connecting disparate domains, circulating resources across boundaries, and positioning computational interventions as universally applicable. Drawing on intellectual traditions that inspect the fixity of universalizing claims, we problematize the easy adoption of computational categories and argue that they serve as epistemic traps that naturalize the expanding reach of computational universalism. Instead of accepting the hardened categories of our interlocutors, we propose attending to the partial, effortful, and often contested work of translation and commensuration that enables computational actors to position themselves as obligatory passage points across all domains. This approach reveals not only the remarkable achievements of computational relationalities at scale but also their exclusions, betrayals, and partialities. Our intervention aims to spur perspectives that examine how computational actors parse both technical objects and social worlds to advance universalizing ambitions while simultaneously obscuring the enormous labor required to maintain these divisions and connections.},

Pipeline failures can lead to serious ecological disasters, loss of life and economic setbacks. To mitigate these risks and maintain the safety and reliability of pipeline facilities, a significant amount of research has been devoted to implementing leakage detection and location systems employing diverse approaches.

  abstract = {This article explores the application of the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm in optimizing parameters of project cost models using sensitivity analysis. Accurate project cost prediction is crucial in construction project management as it directly influences budgeting and resource allocation. The study begins by constructing a project cost model and applying the Sobol sensitivity analysis method to identify key parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is then employed to generate a large dataset of input samples, from which the first-order and total sensitivity indices for each variable are calculated to assess their impact on the model’s output. The NSGA-II algorithm, a multi-objective optimization technique, is utilized to balance multiple objectives within the cost model. By optimizing parameter settings, the study evaluates the model’s predictive performance under various parameter combinations, including the associated time and resource consumption. The optimized model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.042, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.15, and a coefficient of determination (R
            2
            ) of 0.928, demonstrating its high prediction accuracy and robustness. The parameter optimization not only enhances the model’s predictive power but also efficiently manages computational costs, validating the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method.},

BIM is to establish an information integrated system through certain data standards at a certain stage or in the whole process of decision-making, implementation, and operation of construction projects. So as to realize information sharing and information conversion and high-quality and efficient engineering construction. Engineering projects are often completed jointly by multiple project participants. Different project participants will inevitably have certain connections when applying BIM Technology in the project, thus forming a technological innovation network. Using the statistical analysis method, analyze the central data of the network, and the relationship between cross-industry cooperation and innovation performance. Based on the findings from social network analysis and statistical analysis, recommendations are proposed to optimize the network structure and boost technological innovation performance. The analysis reveals that the current network structure is relatively fragmented. To address this, new approaches for information management within the CI are suggested, focusing on modernizing and enhancing the traditional methods of information sharing and transmission.},

In response to the problems of strong subjectivity, insufficient dynamism, and limited data processing capabilities in traditional evaluation models, this article optimized the weights of financial indicators through GAs to improve the scientific and accurate evaluation results. It used 11 financial indicators as the main data to collect financial data from multiple enterprises and form a dataset. GA can be used to optimize the weights of financial indicators. This article constructed a FHA model, evaluated the constructed model, conducted corresponding analysis based on experimental results, and drew conclusions. The results showed that the model optimized by GA had significant improvements in evaluation accuracy and adaptability. The maximum mean squared error (MSE) of the GA in all comparative experiments was 19.962, which was lower than the minimum MSE of 20.043 obtained by other comparative methods. The maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the GA in all comparisons was 4.988, which was lower than the minimum MAE of 5.031 obtained by other comparison methods. This indicates that the enterprise financial health evaluation model based on GA has sufficient accuracy, is more objective in determining the weights of financial indicators, and has higher scientific validity in the evaluation results. The optimized enterprise FHA model provides more effective services for enterprise financial management. By optimizing the enterprise FHA model based on GA, it provides scientific basis for enterprise decision-making, improves enterprise management level, and provides new ideas and methods for the application of GA in enterprise finance. Future research can further explore the combined application of GAs and other intelligent algorithms, explore more efficient optimization methods, and promote the development of FHA research for enterprises.},

  abstract = {Real-time fault monitoring in cable networks with complex topologies is of great significance in improving the stability of power systems. In recent years, Time-Reversal Multiple Signal Classification (TR-MUSIC) has been proposed for soft fault location in cable networks. This method can use single-frequency data to calculate the pseudo-spectrum and the faults can be located by finding the maximum energy positions. However, due to the propagation of harmonic signals, there will be multiple peaks in the pseudo-spectrum in the high-frequency band, which are referred to as ghosting traces. This leads to an inability to accurately determine the location of the soft fault, causing the false peak to be referred to as a ghost fault. This paper analyses the frequency characteristics of the TR-MUSIC method and then introduces the idea of co-prime sampling for frequency sampling to eliminate the influence of ghost fault. The results show that co-prime sampling in TR-MUSIC can counteract the effects of ghosting traces and reduce the computational complexity.},

This article collects learning data from 8 learners from March to June 2020, including characteristics such as learning duration, learning frequency, and learning performance.

The prediction error of LSTM is lower than that of Transformer, GRU, RNN, and HMM, and this maintains high stability in the prediction of 8 learners. Visual analysis of learning trajectories shows that some learners exhibit intermittent learning states with significant fluctuations in learning performance, while others tend to stabilize after a significant increase in performance at specific stages, indicating that their learning strategies are effective in the early stages but then enter a learning bottleneck period. Some learners exhibit a decline in performance, suggesting that their current learning strategies are ineffective. This article highlights the advantages of the LSTM model in predicting English learning outcomes. By dynamically analyzing learners’ progress and trajectories, the model enables the development of personalized and targeted learning recommendations, helping learners refine and optimize their strategies for improved performance.},

This study introduces a novel diagnostic framework, leveraging big data to precisely evaluate these patterns and enhance the allocation of personalized teaching resources. Traditional analysis methodologies, often limited by their inability to effectively process complex data structures and provide operational utility, are thus addressed. The proposed framework incorporates an integrative approach for emotional and cognitive diagnosis, employing Bayesian networks’ probabilistic distribution methods. This approach not only augments the interpretability of diagnostic outcomes but also streamlines the estimation of student ability distributions. Additionally, a groundbreaking multi-objective optimization strategy, grounded in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), is presented, complemented by a solution method devised using a hybrid adaptive ant colony algorithm. This innovative method facilitates the efficient allocation of personalized learning resources, thereby significantly enhancing the adaptability of teaching content to individual student needs. The findings from this methodological and empirical investigation contribute a pioneering perspective to the field of personalized teaching.

From this strategy, we can minimize the response time by getting candidates set quickly from the clustered regions and avoiding partially or wholly access to the underlying systems say database or files. Numerous experiments have been conducted using datasets of varying dimensions, including low-dimensional datasets (2, 3, and 4) and high-dimensional datasets (25, 50, and 104).

First, define a machine learning pipeline with five stages and can support the processing of continuous and discrete type features separately. Then, the automated pipeline design problem is decomposed into two sub problems: structure search and hyper parameter optimization, and an algorithm combining reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization is proposed to alternately optimize the two subproblems. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of automatic pipeline design, two parallelized pipeline construction methods are further proposed. Experimental results show that Auto-PLD outperforms auto-sklearn with most datasets. Moreover, with the increase of computing nodes, the parallelized Auto-PLD can further improve the pipeline building performance. The Auto-PLD-random method performed at 1, 4, and 8 hours respectively: 19, 22, 23, 27, 26, and 25.

  abstract = {This article proposes ‘Thinking with the Archipelago’ as a critical analytical lens to examine racialized urban ecologies and spatial politics in Cartagena, Colombia. Grounded in long-term ethnographic research along the Ciénaga de la Virgen, Cartagena’s largest urban wetland, this study explores how local communities negotiate socio-ecological marginalization amid colonial continuities, green gentrification, and speculative urbanism. Drawing on Caribbean thought, Black geographies, and urban political ecology, I conceptualize the “Archipelago City” as a relational, dynamic space shaped by water, mangroves, and dispossession. This spatial metaphor challenges binary logics of center and periphery, instead foregrounding fragmented but interconnected urban geographies.
          Using the historic eviction of the neighborhood Chambacú as a symbolic and discursive anchor, I trace how racialized displacement and environmental degradation continue to shape urban imaginaries and technocratic development projects. In dialogue with local resistance practices, especially community-led environmental organizing in Comuna 6, I show how everyday experiences of the mangrove become forms of counter-cartography, asserting alternative ecological futures and modes of belonging. Rather than treating nature as a neutral backdrop for development, ‘Thinking with the Archipelago’ centers the poetics and politics of relational space, reclaiming the value of wetland lifeworlds. This approach decenters technocratic narratives and illuminates how communities articulate knowledge and solidarity across fragmented geographies. Ultimately, this article calls for a critical rethinking of urban-environmental futures in the Caribbean, emphasizing how colonial and neoliberal orders are actively contested through situated, everyday practices of resistance and care.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the teaching quality level of university courses is a very meaningful teaching research work. In the context of big data, various artificial intelligence algorithms can effectively utilize massive data to construct intelligent models for evaluating the teaching quality of universities. Popular algorithms include genetic algorithm, BP (Back Propagation) neural network, and support vector machine. However, the modeling steps of these algorithms are usually cumbersome and time-consuming. In response to this, this article proposed a university teaching quality evaluation model based on the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The model calculated the posterior probability of labels using Bayesian formula and the posterior probability of features by statistically analyzing the feature distribution in the sample. The label with the highest posterior probability was selected as the evaluation result for the feature vector. This article designed experiments to verify the performance advantages and disadvantages of this model compared to other models, and compared the modeling time, accuracy, mean square error, and disciplinary generality of the Naive Bayes model with the three aforementioned models. The results indicated that the modeling time of the Naive Bayes model was 0.12 seconds, with an accuracy of 0.895 and a mean square error of 0.1902. The accuracy difference between science and philosophy disciplines was 0.029, with a mean square error difference of 0.0190. Although the model in this article does not have an advantage in prediction accuracy compared to other models, it has good disciplinary universality, mainly due to its simple model structure and extremely short modeling time.},

The study first explained the concept of systems thinking, then provided a review of China’s Ecological Civilization movement and the three pillars of traditional Chinese culture, namely, Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The research aimed to investigate the extent to which holistic Chinese cultural thinking is applied to drive sustainable business practices in China. We drew empirical insights from multiple perspectives and 74 key informant interviews, ranging from Chinese government officials and practitioners to university academics. Using Foucault’s episteme to examine the possibility of a transition to systems thinking, our key findings reveal that the Chinese micro-economy and firm-level operations, whilst being aware of the importance of environmental issues from top–down, still focus on economic values in the short run. However, as an episteme change is recognized over time, it is likely that the gap between vision and practice will be narrowed down, and a sustainable China just might prevail.},

The drift phenomenon of news will affect the recognition of topic detection. This article proposes a Dynamic Subtopic Detection Model for Temporal Text (DSDTT), which establishes both related and independent relationships between topics in time windows by designing leader documents for them. The proposal of “Inflection Point Analysis Method” and “CrossMountain” pattern solves the problems of scattered clustering and low discrimination caused by the minimum perplexity determining the number of topics; the model can automatically construct subtopic evolution scenarios based on time windows, effectively alleviating the phenomenon of topic drift. The experiments were conducted from the optimal number of topics and topic perplexity, dynamic subtopic detection, and subtopic evolution relationship scenarios, verifying that the Dynamic Subtopic Detection Model for Temporal Text outperforms the topic perplexity method in selecting the optimal number of topics and exhibits more accurate tracking performance in dynamic subtopic detection.},

  abstract = {In recent years, in order to deal with the frequent occurrence of disasters, master and predict the law of disaster occurrence, and explore the nature, disaster knowledge map construction and analysis and application technology have become an important research hotspot and direction. However, existing knowledge graph structures for natural disasters often focus only on temporal or spatial properties, lacking the integration of spatiotemporal properties. Therefore, this paper proposes a technique for constructing a typical disaster knowledge graph integrated with its spatial and temporal characteristics. First of all, through the analysis of typical disaster events, established the “event-space-time-causal” triplet model, the disaster three factors relationship, formed a comprehensive, systematic disaster knowledge framework, and then use deep learning technology of semantic analysis of large amounts of text data and relationship extraction, to automatically build a disaster knowledge map. In the test verification, this paper takes a natural disaster as an example to construct a typical disaster knowledge map integrating spatial and temporal characteristics, and conducts empirical analysis. The results show that the knowledge graph construction method can better express the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of some natural disasters, and provide more comprehensive and accurate disaster prevention and control and response strategies for decision-making agencies. In conclusion, the typical disaster knowledge map construction technology integrating spatial and temporal characteristics is a novel and effective disaster response method with great application potential.},

  abstract = {Renowned for its scientific, artistic, and cultural innovations, the Han dynasty marked a significant turning point in Chinese history. The use of ink, brushstrokes, and thematic components influenced by Confucianism, Daoism, and other philosophical traditions are few of the creative styles and methods that were popular during this period in Han painting (HP). HP is distinguished by its delicate brushstrokes, subtle ink washes, and meticulous attention to detail. It frequently depicts themes of nature, landscapes, animals, and everyday life. As an integral part of China’s creative legacy, this form of art continues to be honored and it had a significant effect on later Chinese painting (CP) shape. HPs’ color qualities and Patterns would suffer significant deterioration with time. Research on the culture indicates that Han art is limited. In addition, there is a powerful correlation between changes in the reliability of CP and the environment. The conservation and study of traditional Chinese HP techniques by artificial intelligence (AI) offers a possible path forward for the preservation and knowledge of this historic art form. In this research, the link between safeguarding the environment and the patterns (P), color (C), and shapes (S) of CP was investigated using a novel earthworm tuned recurrent neural network (EW- TRNN). We gathered Hans CP datasets as experimental data. Image preprocessing using Gaussian blur filter for noise reduction. Feature extraction employs the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to capture the textural P and brushwork style characteristics. The study’s findings demonstrate that the suggested approach is more authentic in predicting the P, S, and C features of Chinese artworks. Finally, we conclude by stating that we may improve preservation efforts, research, and public happiness of HPs among contemporary audiences by utilizing AI-driven methodologies. This work assurance the endurance and accessibility of HPs for future generations by highlighting the revolutionary possibility of AI in bridging the gap between tradition and technological advances.},

  abstract = {The complexity of information data makes strengthening information evaluation and screening an important research content. Traditional association analysis algorithms are difficult to perform strong analysis on association rules, and they do not sufficiently grasp data feature information. Therefore, based on the original association classification algorithm, multiple learning of training sets and setting of interest threshold are studied to improve the correlation between category labels and reduce the interference of redundant information. Subsequently, multiple tag feature selection algorithms and frequent pattern trees are introduced to measure data information using tag importance as a metric, improving information processing efficiency, and implementing algorithm processing through local connection and pruning operations. The information evaluation results of the improved algorithm proposed in the study show that the training error of the improved association classification (AC) algorithm is 2.36%, and the maximum training error difference and time consumption range between the improved AC algorithm and other algorithms reach 31.28% and 14.28%, greatly improving the operational efficiency and classification accuracy of the algorithm. Simultaneously improve the average classification error and Recall@K Increased to 10.37% and above 5%, effectively achieving information evaluation accuracy.

This article used gated recurrent unit (GRU) to conduct in-depth analysis and learning of athlete training data, and designed targeted training plans for athletes to achieve the goal of improving sports performance. Firstly, a set of athlete training data was collected, and wavelet transform and box plot methods were utilized to denoise and handle outliers in the data; then, the GRU model was used to analyze these data and extract the most valuable feature indicators, providing a basis for adjusting subsequent training schemes. Finally, taking 15 basketball players from A University as research subjects, a personalized training plan was designed to help them better train and improve training effectiveness. The experiment showed that 15 athletes were selected, and their average score on the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) test after the experiment was 14.73 points, which was 2.4 points higher than before the experiment. Before the experiment, only 4 people had an FMS score of 14 or above, accounting for 26.67%, which was very low. However, after the experiment, 12 people had an FMS score of 14 or above, accounting for as high as 80%. Based on the GRU model, personalized training plans were studied to improve athlete performance and health, providing new research ideas for athletes to develop personalized training plans.

By introducing double deep Q-network architecture and advantage function, the scheduling strategy of the robot is optimized.

The simulation results show that the improved deep Q-network algorithm performs well in vehicle scheduling optimization with a reward value of 46.8. By analyzing the distribution of vehicles in the garage under different algorithms, the effectiveness of the improved deep Q-network algorithm in preferentially utilizing high-quality garage resources is further verified. It demonstrates how the enhanced deep Q-network algorithm can efficiently optimize the automated parking lot’s scheduling strategy while utilizing the premium garage to lower operational energy usage.},

It constructs differentiated users from the perspective of dissatisfaction with electricity usage and differentiated LAs from the perspective of deviations in aggregated load response, with both parties aiming to maximize their utility functions through game play.

  abstract = {Due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak in 2019, many schools are unable to teach online, which stimulates the birth of a new teaching model in the education industry. Online teaching has developed by leaps and bounds with the rapid development of information technology. Information-based teaching is a way to enhance student learning from the learning environment. There are many factors that influence the learning environment, including the classroom teaching scenario, cooperation between teachers and students, and communication in the classroom. In the teaching process, the teaching mode has changed from the traditional teacher-teaching-student-learning fill-in-the-blank teaching to the independent acquisition of knowledge by students. In order to investigate the current status of teaching informatics on the Internet, we chose a university in city A as a research object to investigate the current status of teaching informatics in its online philosophy department. At present, information technology teaching in China is still in a backward state. The current situation of information-based teaching in China is (1) the lack of information-based teaching resources and the lack of standardization in the use of resources. (2) Lack of awareness of online information teaching. In order to promote the level of online information-based learning of our schoolchildren from a comprehensive perspective, and in response to the drawbacks of online information-based teaching in China found in the above experimental survey, we propose an online information-based learning model based on big data and artificial intelligence decision-making to enhance students’ learning interest through an interesting learning model. After experimental verification, it can be concluded that our proposed model can significantly improve students’ behavioral performance and learning ability, and has a certain role in enhancing students’ learning effectiveness. Finally, we make recommendations based on the current state of application of big data and artificial intelligence in online informatics teaching. The recommendations are to improve the current situation of information-based teaching on the one hand to improve the quality of information-based resources, which requires the joint gate-keeping of the government, schools and teachers. On the other hand, the information technology literacy of teachers should be improved.},

This paper introduces a highly practical distributed control strategy for managing clusters of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs).

The proposed control strategy defines a priority list, where TCLs can locally reconstruct the global priority list through distributed information exchange. Based on this list, TCLs make local decisions regarding their operational states. Furthermore, the strategy employs an asynchronous communication protocol, which significantly reduces the cost of establishing communication networks compared to control strategies based on synchronous communication. Numerical simulations confirm that, under the asynchronous communication mechanism, the proposed strategy effectively achieves precise tracking of the cluster’s aggregated power relative to the reference power, while also minimizing occurrences of temperature exceedance.},

  abstract = {In the advertising industry, understanding consumers’ sentiment reactions and preferences towards advertising images is crucial. To gain a deeper understanding for the impact of advertising images on audience sentiments and preference prediction, a saliency prediction model and an advertising preference prediction model for text reinforcement learning are proposed based on eye movement data. The saliency prediction model enhanced the visual features of advertising images by analyzing the text saliency in advertisements. The advertising preference prediction model utilized eye movement data and graph convolutional neural networks to understand individual visual reactions and sentiment preferences towards advertising images. The performance test results indicated that the proposed significance prediction model performed excellently on the accuracy-recall curve and F-measure curve. The accuracy on the model prediction performance of the study using the method was 0.787, SROCC was 0.628, PLCC was 0.583, and EMD decreased to 0.064. The highest SROCC value between the model and the true value can reach 0.6169, the highest PLCC can reach 0.5722, and the lowest error is 0.1929. The average similarity of the advertising preference prediction model was about 0.55 when the liking score was 1. When the score was 7, the average similarity increased to about 0.65. It presents that the method can effectively predict different preferences and meet practical application needs. As a result, the study not only enriches the research framework of advertising sentiment analysis and preference prediction but also provides more practical tools and methods for advertisement design, personalized recommendation, and marketing strategy development. Sentiment analysis models can be further explored in future research and their practical applications can be developed to promote the digital and intelligent transformation of the advertising industry.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of emerging enterprises, efficient information resource sharing has become crucial. Entrepreneurial information contains various types of data, usually presented in images and visual documents, with rich spatial and temporal features. However, traditional information sharing models face difficulties in handling unstructured data and heterogeneous data from multiple sources, which limits the depth and breadth of information sharing. To address this issue, this study proposes an enterprise information resource sharing model based on YOLO algorithm, which combines a gated recurrent unit with an improved YOLOv4, taking shipyard enterprises as an example for research. YOLO, as a powerful real-time object detection tool, can effectively process image and visual document data. The results indicated that the proposed improved YOLOv4 achieved optimal recall, precision, and accuracy at a batch size of 16 and 80. It performed better than CNN and RNN in key metrics. MSE decreased by 25.33% and 5.17%, respectively, RMSE decreased by 13.64% and 2.58%, respectively, and MAE decreased by 56.67% and 26.37%, respectively. The YOLO-based model significantly enhances the efficiency and quality of information sharing in shipyard enterprises. Its applicability extends to other industries, providing scalable solutions for optimizing resource management.},

The research uses probabilistic algorithms to analyze the parallel solution of data. Based on the COBIT5.0 dimension of contributing factors, the implementation framework of the “Internet plus + Audit” model based on cloud accounting is constructed from seven specific factors: principles and policies, cultural atmosphere, personnel requirements, organizational structure, information resources, infrastructure and process design. By combining quantitative and qualitative analysis methods, threats from enterprises and cloud providers are evaluated, and vulnerability analysis is conducted. Through simulation analysis, the effectiveness of the big data audit method based on COBIT standards proposed in this article in the cloud accounting environment has been verified. This method can significantly improve the effectiveness of accounting and auditing, achieving efficient data processing and rapid generation of audit decisions. For auditing units, especially small and medium-sized ones, this method helps to break down technical barriers and promote service optimization and innovation. At the same time, the integration and collaboration of cloud resources will promote the transformation of audit mode to joint audit mode, achieve the integration of high-quality resources, and improve the independence and efficiency of auditing.},

            Psychology students frequently continue to endorse psychological myths and misconceptions. The refutational method of instruction can reduce myth endorsement.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to replicate and extend prior research using infographics to refute psychological myths and misconceptions.
          
          
            Method
            
              Undergraduate students in two online courses (
              N
               = 46) completed refutational infographics on assigned myths and shared them in groups. Researchers assessed myth endorsement and critical thinking attitudes and beliefs at the beginning and end of the project.
            
          
          
            Results
            Post-project myth endorsement was significantly lower for students’ assigned myths and other myths that peer groups exposed them to. Attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking were significantly higher at the end of the project.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Refutational infographics are associated with lower psychological myth endorsement and increased critical thinking attitudes and beliefs among intermediate- and upper-level psychology students. Exposure to peers’ refutational infographics is also associated with reduced myth endorsement.

  abstract = {Introduction:
            Early detection through routine screening methods, such as the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, is crucial for reducing cervical cancer mortality. However, the Pap smear method faces challenges including subjective interpretation, significant variability in diagnostic confidence, and high susceptibility to human errors—leading to both false negatives (missed abnormalities) and false positives (unnecessary follow-up procedures). Providing a first opinion could improve the screening examination pipeline and greatly aid the specialist’s confidence in reporting. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have shown promise in automating cell classification, reducing human error, and identifying subtle abnormalities that may be missed by experts.
          
          
            Methods:
            In this study, we present RunicNet, a CNN-based architecture with attention mechanisms designed to classify Pap smear cell images. RunicNet integrates attention mechanisms such as High-Frequency Attention Blocks-enhanced Residual Blocks for improved feature extraction, Pixel Attention for computational efficiency, and a Gated-Dconv Feed-Forward Network to refine image representation. The model was trained on a dataset of 85 080 cell images, employing data augmentation and class balancing techniques to address dataset imbalances.
          
          
            Results:
            Evaluated on a separate testing dataset, RunicNet achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.78, significantly outperforming baseline models such as ResNet-18 (F1-score of 0.53) and a fully connected CNN (F1-score of 0.66).
          
          
            Discussion:
            The findings support the potential of attention-based CNN models like RunicNet to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening. Integrating such AI systems into clinical workflows may enhance early detection and reduce diagnostic variability in Pap smear analysis.},

  abstract = {The nonnegative representation-based classification (NRC) method has attracted increasing attention in the field of face recognition. Building upon collaborative representation (CR), NRC incorporates a nonnegative constraint on the representation coefficients, thereby reducing the contribution of irrelevant training samples and enhancing overall classification performance. Despite these improvements, NRC inherits the same decision-making mechanism as the CR method, resulting in a decoupling of the representation and classification stages. This separation limits the method’s classification effectiveness. Furthermore, the presence of multicollinearity in the nonnegative representation may introduce inaccuracies in classification estimates, further undermining performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the competitive-collaborative nonnegative representation (CCNR) model. CCNR integrates two regularization terms: A competitive constraint and a collaborative constraint. The competitive constraint adopts a residual-based strategy during the classification stage, thereby strengthening the connection between representation and classification. This approach enables training samples from different classes to compete in representing the query sample, significantly improving classification performance. In parallel, the collaborative constraint applies an

The extent to which scholars believe the security dilemma’s pernicious effects can be ameliorated marks a key dividing line between theoretical approaches to international relations. However, questions about the intractability of the security dilemma have remained largely theoretical and not directly empirically tested. We take advantage of the fact that the security dilemma relies on individual-level mental processes. We use parallel survey experiments in the United States and China across two waves in early 2020 and mid-2023 to assess the extent to which threat perceptions consistent with security dilemma thinking exist among mass publics, change with political context, and can be ameliorated. Our findings are consistent with interpretations of the security dilemma emphasizing its relative intractability. At least in the U.S.-China context, threat perceptions consistent with security dilemma thinking do not appear easily ameliorated by priming respondents to consider factors believed to ameliorate the security dilemma: offense-defense distinguishability, economic interdependence, nuclear weapons, and the reciprocal nature of the security dilemma.},

Additionally, the scanner wall is typically joined to the gradient spiral cylinder, causing vibrations to be transmitted to the wall and thereby producing extra sound waves. The present study investigates methods for mitigating noise from the scanner wall and reducing the transmission noise from the spiral gradient cylinder. Numerical methods and practical solutions for lowering acoustic noise in MRI gradient coils are explored. A 20 mm uniform absorber is demonstrated as an effective design for significantly reducing acoustic noise in the frequency range 0 to 3 kHz.

The application of information technology has made management more intelligent, with smart systems and big data analytics providing services more closely aligned with student needs. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies, NLP techniques have also made significant strides. This paper introduces an innovative SC-BGRU-ATT sentiment polarity analysis framework for analyzing student comment data using NLP techniques. This framework begins with the extraction of textual data using word embedding techniques, followed by further feature processing through Text-CNN and BI-GRU with a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a classification module is employed to identify the sentiment polarity of the texts. The test results on public datasets show that the framework achieves over 80% accuracy in identifying two types of sentiment polarity, and over 90% accuracy on self-built datasets. This significant performance demonstrates the potential of our framework in advancing sentiment polarity analysis. Moreover, by accurately capturing and analyzing students’ sentiment and opinions, this approach supports more effective self-organization and management of students. The innovation of this study lies in the integration of multiple models and the enhancement of relevant modules’ performance, leading to an improvement in sentiment polarity analysis. This technological advancement not only refines sentiment polarity analysis but also provides a scalable and adaptable framework for analyzing student sentiment in educational settings. The improved model performance offers robust, data-driven support for decision-making in student management, enabling institutions to better understand and respond to student needs.

Amidst the contemporary artistic education milieu, pedagogical practices have embraced an amalgam of online and offline intelligent instruction modes, thus broadening the art students’ access to artistic portraiture. However, the abundance of digital resources has created a concomitant conundrum regarding the classification and selection of artistic portraiture, emerging as a pressing issue. Emotion recognition, a mechanism that enables natural human-computer interaction, assumes critical importance in artistic portraiture classification, as character emotional expressions serve as a pivotal basis for the said classification. Nevertheless, the extensive costs incurred during the collection and annotation of emotional data related to artistic portraiture constitute a major bottleneck that inhibits the development of emotion recognition research. This paper endeavors to explore the application of knowledge transfer between cross-domains or cross-tasks to enhance the efficacy of emotion recognition in scenarios involving limited or no labeling. To achieve efficient classification of portraiture, the paper employs a blend of domain adaptive and transfer learning techniques to map features onto a shared space between domains. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through unsupervised sentiment classification and labeling of artistic portraiture based on the collected dataset, which resulted in an improvement in performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 46.7% compared to the most relevant domain adaptive sentiment analysis methods.},

  abstract = {As global environmental problems become increasingly severe, the concept of green development has gradually become an important strategic direction for corporate development. As an important tool to measure the environmental performance of enterprises, green accounting is of great significance to promote the sustainable development of enterprises. Green accounting performance evaluation can not only help enterprises identify and improve their environmental management strategies, but also provide data support for the formulation of relevant policies. However, the existing performance evaluation methods mostly focus on quantitative analysis, lacking systematic and comprehensive evaluation. Therefore, this study puts forward a performance evaluation model of enterprise green accounting based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, in order to scientifically evaluate enterprise green accounting performance in a multi-factor and multi-level environment. First, through literature research and expert interviews, this study determines the key indicators that affect the performance of enterprises’ green accounting, including resource utilization efficiency, pollution emission control, and environmental protection investment return. These weights derived from AHP are then integrated into the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, where they are applied to weight the membership degrees of each performance indicator. This integration allows the model to combine the structural rigor of AHP with the flexibility of fuzzy logic, resulting in a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of green accounting performance. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to generate a weighted composite score that reflects the overall environmental performance of enterprises across multiple green accounting indicators. Through the case analysis of three typical enterprises, the evaluation model based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can accurately reflect the actual performance of enterprises in green accounting. It demonstrates high applicability and operability, particularly for medium to large-sized enterprises in resource-intensive sectors such as chemical manufacturing, energy, and metallurgy, where environmental management and green investment decisions are of strategic importance. The data analysis shows that the comprehensive score of green accounting performance of enterprises evaluated by this model has increased by about 12% to 18% compared with traditional evaluation methods that rely primarily on financial metrics or single-dimensional environmental indicators. The data analysis shows that the comprehensive score of green accounting performance of enterprises evaluated by this model has increased by about 12% to 18% compared with the traditional evaluation method. The model produces a composite score for each enterprise and also classifies performance into qualitative levels such as excellent, good, moderate, passed, and failed, based on defined thresholds. This dual output enables both precise quantification and intuitive interpretation of enterprise green performance, while also effectively identifying the influence of each indicator on the overall performance and providing specific directions for improvement.},

  abstract = {Sentiment classification and prediction are critical research areas in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting sentiment tendencies and opinions from text. Previous studies have predominantly relied on sentiment dictionaries, machine learning, or deep learning methods, each of which presents two main challenges. First, sentiment dictionaries and machine learning methods heavily depend on manually constructed sentiment lexicons and features, resulting in relatively low accuracy. Second, deep learning models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and are frequently regarded as “black box” systems, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. To address these issues, we propose an optimization method for text sentiment classification that combines a large language model (LLM) with a deep learning BERT model. Specifically, building on the concept of ensemble learning, we perform dual sentiment determination by fine-tuning the BERT model in conjunction with the cue-based GPT-3.5-turbo LLM. This approach utilizes the LLM to provide a robust basis for sentiment judgment. Validation is conducted using two classical datasets: one from the entertainment domain and another from the marketing domain. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy exceeding 90%, outperforming the benchmark model by at least 2 percentage points. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing multi-domain sentiment classification performance.},

  abstract = {During COVID-19, a blended approach to online and offline interactive teaching and learning will be a primary mobile teaching methodology. The effectiveness of online and offline interactive blended learning models depends heavily on the evaluation and optimization of the quality of instruction. However, current evaluation methods often lack systematicity and accuracy, and cannot fully reflect the actual performance and learning effects of students in the interactive blended learning mode. To optimize student learning in this mobile mode, it is most important to adhere to the basic design principles, utilize micro-learning resources and establish a mobile online teaching platform. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation system and a hybrid teaching quality evaluation model based on back propagation (BP) neural network were proposed in the study. The new model innovatively combined BP neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) to propose a GA-BP optimization model. Subsequently, the accuracy and dependability of teaching quality evaluation were successfully increased by the study’s establishment of a thorough hybrid mobile system. The outcomes revealed superior student performance in the hybrid teaching mode compared to traditional methods, with an increase in the number of students achieving high scores. Among the four evaluation models (GA, BSA, BP, and GA-BP), GA-BP demonstrated the closest alignment with original grades. It yielded mean error and mean relative error of 3.78 and 0.03, respectively, representing the smallest discrepancies. These findings underpinned the efficacy of the blended instructional model in enhancing student learning outcomes. Moreover, the GA-BP-based mobile evaluation model was more accurate in assessing the quality of instruction, thus providing a more effective evaluation.},

  abstract = {According to the constructivist learning theory, learners need to actively construct a knowledge system in a practical situation, and deep learning, with intelligent data analysis, pattern recognition and predictive decision-making capabilities, just builds a practical platform for students to discover market opportunities and formulate innovative solutions, which effectively promotes the development of their innovation and entrepreneurship skills. At the same time, deep learning emphasizes the understanding, utilization and generation of knowledge, and further strengthens students’ innovation and entrepreneurship literacy by cultivating human-machine collaboration, which is in line with the concept of “learning by doing” in contextual cognitive theory. In addition, deep learning has the characteristics of thinking training, knowledge transfer and application, which echoes the requirements of higher-order thinking cultivation in Bloom’s educational goal classification theory, which can effectively improve the knowledge integration, transformation and application ability of college students, and enhance the ability of knowledge creation and innovation and entrepreneurship. In the application of practical education scenarios, taking the YOLOv5s network as an example, after the introduction of the SE module and the SIoU loss function, the average accuracy (mAP) of the feature detection and entrepreneurship scene recognition tasks of innovative projects is increased to 89.74% and 89.33%, respectively. This significant performance improvement intuitively demonstrates the ability of deep learning algorithms to accurately analyze education data. Through the efficient processing of educational data such as classroom teaching videos and project display images, the system can accurately identify students’ innovative thinking performance and entrepreneurial practice scenarios, and then provide data support for teachers to optimize teaching design and reform teaching methods, tailor personalized learning paths for students, truly realize data-driven educational innovation, and promote the deep integration of innovation and entrepreneurship education theory and practice.},

An anonymous communication model for small-scale users is further proposed. When the data size was 100 MB, the proposed algorithm had an upload time cost of approximately 827.3 ms and a download time cost of 208.4 ms. The proposed method reduced communication time by 37.86%, 30.43%, and 16.88% compared with other methods, respectively.

  abstract = {As a middle-ranking power that projects its vision internationally and aspires for global recognition, India is embedded in its specific traditions and presents itself as a voice of the Global South. India promotes dialogue as opposed to confrontation and has from the highest level stated ‘this is not the time for war’. Peace as rhetoric and practice constitutes a feminist principle. In the light of this positioning, what would a feminist foreign policy (FFP) look like and how should it be measured? In this article, we trace recent debates on an FFP and examine how it can conceptually apply to Indian foreign policy. Policymakers who seek positive change advocate an FFP, in keeping with UN Security Council Resolutions (SCR) 1325 and others that call for the participation of women in institutions of peace, politics and security. With a focus on the case of India, we broaden the paradigm of the FFP to include internationally accepted norms like sustainable development goals and human security be part of the goals of FFP. Further, we seek to broaden the metrics of how FFP can challenge patriarchal systems and intersecting oppressions. In doing so, it is situated at the intersection of the literature on critical foreign policy analysis and postcolonial scholarship (Achilleos-Sarll, 2018,

  abstract = {The study primarily focuses on the optimization of query scheduling within economic dynamic systems, which are characterized by vast, sensitive datasets that necessitate exceptional accuracy and reliability. As the digital age accelerates data proliferation, the complexity of data retrieval escalates, leading to critical challenges such as sluggish query speeds and inconsistent results in existing systems. Traditional query algorithms, which rely on basic search logic such as keyword matching and hyperlink analysis, have been proven unsuitable for enterprise-scale operations, often resulting in delays and inaccurate data. To address these deficiencies, an Improved Query Scheduling (IQS) algorithm is embedded within an economic dynamic system model. The IQS leverages continuous data reading capabilities to enable seamless algorithm execution, coupled with weighted screening of query node loads. This approach significantly reduces central processing unit strain while enhancing query efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model, which processed multiple combinations of query features with a CPU execution time of less than 5 seconds and achieved near-perfect query accuracy (0.99). In real-world deployments, the model maintained stable load distribution, completing platform-level queries in 16.56 seconds at a spatial frequency of 1. These findings underscore the model’s superior query scheduling capabilities for economic dynamic systems, confirming its ability to efficiently handle routine economic data queries with precision and reliability. This advancement offers a robust solution to the persistent challenges of data-intensive economic environments.},

Alkali-treated natural fibers were utilized to fabricate composites with optimum microwave power and processing time of 600 W and 720 ± 30 s, respectively. Mechanical tests showed notable improvements compared to pure HDPE, comprising a 24.1% augmentation in tensile strength (24.2 ± 1.3 MPa), a 10.6% increase in Shore D hardness (59.2 ± 2.5), a 32.3% enhancement in flexural strength (18.3 ± 0.9 MPa), and a 28.5% rise in impact strength (23.6 ± 1.4 kJ/m²). Wear experiments indicated that wear and specific wear rate (S

            increases at lower loads (10–20 N) at moderate velocities. Friction studies showed reduced and uniform friction forces for the hybrid composite, whereas HDPE experienced 50% higher friction forces accompanied by thermal softening and adhesive wear. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated a wear progression from mild adhesive at 1 m/s to severe abrasive and thermal wear at 3 m/s. The HDPE matrix underwent substantial degradation, whereas natural fibers enhanced load-bearing capability, enhancing composite stability and tribological performance.

Traditional video analysis methods often perform poorly and have low accuracy when analyzing micro-classroom videos. To address this issue, the research introduces a novel approach for constructing an intelligent video analysis platform. This approach integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network with the You Only Look Once version 5 small (YOLOv5s) algorithm. The bidirectional feature pyramid network classifies and integrates video image information. The research then utilizes the YOLOv5s algorithm to collect feature information from intelligent video images within micro-classrooms. The image feature information goes through an input-output process. Next, the research incorporates a fusion compression excitation attention module to improve the accuracy of model-based video analysis, ultimately building an intelligent video analysis platform for micro-classrooms. The results show that the proposed method achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.31% for various video image information, with a harmonic mean of 97.67%. Its average accuracy for video analysis reaches 0.91, significantly exceeding that of other algorithm models. In the practical effect analysis experiment of the video analysis platform, the micro-teaching software shows a memory occupancy rate of only 1.54% and a central processor occupancy rate of just 1.77%. Additionally, its response time is better than that of other video analysis platforms. These findings indicate that the proposed method provides high accuracy and strong practicality for intelligent video analysis in micro-classrooms.},

The visualization analysis of basketball player data is significant for the analysis of individual value and potential of athletes. However, existing data analysis methods have problems such as insufficient efficiency, low accuracy, and insufficient attention to the inherent attributes of sports events. Therefore, to better analyze the composition data of basketball team members, the study combines Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Random under-sampling techniques to handle the imbalance in the athlete dataset, and then uses Random Forest (RF) to extract data features. Based on this data processing, a ensemble learning method based on SMOTE, Random under-sampling, and RF (SRR)-Voting is proposed to predict athlete performance. The results demonstrated that in the player dataset analysis, the Precision, Recall, and F1 of the research method were 0.9486, 0.9588, and 0.9752, which were superior to comparative methods. The proposed method had a ROC value of 0.94 and a fitting value of 0.17, indicating better fitting performance.

Traditional manual approaches to inorganic materials database construction are labor-intensive and error-prone. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that leverages instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge extraction and discovery in inorganic materials science. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific corpora—including peer-reviewed articles, patents, and chemical databases—the system accurately extracts structured material-property-synthesis relationships from unstructured text. These records are aligned to a schema and stored in a queryable knowledge graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate inverse design by prompting LLMs to generate candidate materials satisfying user-defined targets (e.g., high thermal conductivity). Evaluations on benchmark synthesis corpora show high accuracy in named entity recognition (F1-score &gt; 95%) and low numerical error for temperature/duration extraction. The resulting database supports effective downstream applications such as Curie temperature prediction (RMSE = 23.6 K, R

  abstract = {Ethnic costume patterns are important carriers of cultural heritage, containing rich historical and aesthetic values. Digitizing and preserving these patterns through segmentation techniques contributes to cultural education and resists the threat of cultural erosion brought about by globalization. To this end, this study introduces an intuitive fuzzy clustering optimization (IFCO) algorithm based on spatial neighborhood information (SNI) and membership constraint penalty term (MCPT) enhancement, which achieves robust segmentation of ethnic minority clothing patterns. By further integrating complementary spatial information (CSI) and membership connectivity mechanism (MDCM), a Minority Clothing Pattern Segmentation Combined with an Intuitive Fuzzy Clustering Optimization (MCPSC-IFCO) method is proposed. This method utilizes the Gaussian kernel distance metric (GKDM) to effectively suppress noise and capture complex patterns. The results showed that in mixed noise application environments of 5%, 8%, and 10%, the research method’s partition coefficient and partition entropy achieved excellent performance, with average values of 97.43% and 4.62%, respectively. In the segmentation environment of colored ethnic minority clothing patterns, the research method has greatly improved the segmentation performance compared to mainstream methods, with average segmentation coefficients and entropy of 97.04% and 5.29%, respectively. In the running efficiency results, the average running time was 36.84 ms. The above research results highlight the important significance of digital technology in protecting and promoting minority cultures, promoting cultural diversity and identity.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has become a powerful paradigm in computational biology, offering data-driven models for mapping protein sequences to structure and function with high precision. In the context of protein structure prediction and functional annotation, traditional sequence-alignment and template-based methods are often limited by low homology and structural diversity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified deep learning framework that integrates sequence modeling, structural representation, and functional inference into a single architecture. The system employs transformer-based encoders to extract contextual features from amino acid sequences and graph neural networks to capture spatial dependencies within predicted structures. A multi-task learning approach is designed to perform C

            backbone reconstruction and enzyme class prediction simultaneously. The framework leverages joint training on sequence features and predicted inter-residue geometry to improve generalization on rare or multifunctional proteins. Experiments on public benchmark datasets such as CASP14 and CAMEO-Hard demonstrate a 12.4% reduction in backbone RMSD compared to AlphaFold2 and a 9.7% improvement in PR-AUC for contact prediction, validating the effectiveness of joint learning and structural integration. Compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines including RoseTTAFold and trRosetta, our system achieves consistently superior accuracy across structure and function tasks. This work provides a modular, end-to-end solution for large-scale protein analysis and shows potential for extension to downstream tasks such as mutation effect prediction or protein–protein interaction modeling.},

  abstract = {Existing methods for evaluating and predicting the health status of ecosystems suffer from low efficiency and low prediction accuracy. Therefore, an urban ecosystem health evaluation system and simulation prediction method based on geographic information systems and improved Markov models is proposed. Firstly, the basic geographic data of the research area is obtained through the spatial analysis function of GIS and the interpretation technology of urban remote sensing images. Based on the pressure-state-response model framework, 15 quantitative indicators were selected from three dimensions: environmental pressure, ecological status quo, and human coping to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system. In the stage of health status assessment, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to intelligently optimize the penalty factor and kernel function parameters of the support vector machine. By adaptively adjusting the position and velocity of the particles to find the optimal parameter combination, an ecosystem health classification model with the best classification performance is finally established. The prediction module integrates the dual advantages of Markov chains and cellular automata, uses the historical state transition probability matrix to represent the evolution law of the time dimension, combines the neighborhood transformation rule of CA to describe the spatial diffusion effect, and generates future multi-scenario prediction results through explicit iterative calculations in space. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method reached 95.2%, with a root mean square error of only 0.08. After applying the proposed method to practical ecosystem health management, the probability of the health status of the corresponding regional ecosystem transitioning to a healthier state reached 0.45% and 0.30%, respectively. In addition, the health status recognition accuracy of the proposed method also reached over 98%. The urban ecological health assessment and simulation prediction method proposed in the research can effectively assist in the effective implementation of ecosystem maintenance work and provide a reliable basis for urban ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems are pivotal for enabling high-capacity wireless communications in next-generation networks. However, effective beamforming remains a key challenge due to high propagation loss and the dynamic nature of mmWave channels. Traditional approaches relying on exhaustive search or static codebooks are inefficient in mobile and blocked environments. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive beamforming algorithm that formulates beam selection as a Markov Decision Process and applies the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method to learn continuous-valued beamforming strategies. To enhance reliability, the framework integrates a hybrid policy mechanism that fuses learned actions with domain-aware heuristics for robustness under uncertainty. Simulation results show that our method achieves up to 35% higher spectral efficiency and 1.5 dB lower beam misalignment loss compared to DQN and heuristic baselines, while converging 40% faster during training. These results highlight the promise of actor–critic reinforcement learning in realizing intelligent, low-overhead beam control for dynamic mmWave MIMO environments.},

  abstract = {The growing influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital media has catalyzed the development of autonomous content creation, transforming the production and consumption of visual art, design, and cultural narratives. Despite advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), existing research often overlooks comprehensive frameworks that assess both the aesthetic quality and moral implications of AI-generated content. This research aims to bridge that gap by proposing a holistic evaluation framework tailored for GAN-generated visual media. The novelty lies in combining aesthetic feature analysis with moral assessment using deep learning and language-based evaluation tools. It utilizes the ArtBench-10 dataset, which consists of 10 diverse artistic styles. Preprocessing steps include z-score normalization, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and resizing images to 256 × 256 pixels to standardize input and enhance visual clarity. For aesthetic analysis, key features such as color harmony, texture richness, symmetry, and compositional balance were extracted using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. The proposed method employs a conditional GAN (cGAN) to autonomously generate artwork, while a GPT-based language model, along with a rule-based ethics filter, evaluates associated textual metadata to detect potential moral issues, such as bias, cultural appropriation, and offensive content. Implemented using TensorFlow 2.0, the model supports modularity and real-time evaluation. Results indicate superior classification performance, achieving 96.3% precision and a 95.2% F1-score, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework in selecting aesthetically coherent and ethically sound AI-generated visual outputs.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of financial fraud in digital finance applications—such as mobile banking, cryptocurrency transactions, and online payment gateways—has rendered traditional rule-based detection systems increasingly ineffective, leading to heightened financial losses and security vulnerabilities. These systems struggle to adapt to complex fraudulent schemes, resulting in inefficiencies in identifying such activities. This research introduces a Scalable Black Widow-driven Gradient Boosting Machine (SBW-GBM) framework designed to enhance fraud detection through real-time data analysis and machine learning (ML). The framework evaluates performance in both decentralized finance and traditional financial contexts, utilizing two separate datasets. The first dataset is based on an Ethereum Phishing Transaction Network; the second originates from Kaggle and pertains to Credit Risk Assessment. Data preparation involves addressing missing values, normalizing numerical features, and employing outlier detection techniques to improve data quality. For feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces data dimensionality while preserving critical information regarding transaction behaviors. The classification employs Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for high predictive accuracy, with the SBW algorithm dynamically fine-tuning GBM hyperparameters to enhance efficiency. Inspired by black widow spiders, the SBW algorithm optimizes hyperparameter selection by eliminating weak solutions and reinforcing stronger ones. This results in an adaptive fraud detection model trained on labeled transaction data. Experimental results confirm that SBW-GBM achieves an F1-score of 0.899, an accuracy of 0.948, an error rate of 0.128, and an experimental runtime of 0.40 seconds on Dataset 1, outperforming the baseline FFSVM. For Dataset 2, SBW-GBM attains a precision of 0.875, a recall of 0.660, an F1-score of 0.750, and an AUC of 0.932, surpassing benchmark traditional classifiers. By continuously learning from new transaction patterns, the proposed framework ensures adaptability to emerging threats and supports real-time fraud detection.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced algorithmic music composition; however, generating emotionally expressive music remains an unresolved challenge. The application of existing models in emotional computing is limited, and has difficulty matching musical characteristics with human-perceived emotions. The research proposes an Intelligent Golden Eagle-driven Scalable Reinforcement Learning (IGE-SRL) framework to optimize the emotional depth of AI-generated music compositions. Data collection involves compiling a dataset of emotionally labeled music pieces from open source. The dataset includes diverse genres and emotional contexts, ensuring balanced representation. Preprocessing includes noise reduction into fixed-length sequences. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted as key features to capture timbral and spectral characteristics relevant to emotional perception. The IGE-SRL framework uses a policy network to generate melodies and harmonies with an adaptive reward function, integrating emotion recognition models, listener feedback, and sentiment analysis. The IGE algorithm improves exploration-exploitation balance by dynamically adjusting learning parameters, while the SRL agent refines music sequences through policy gradient updates, ensuring emotionally coherent pieces. When compared to traditional methods and rule-based approaches, the suggested IGE-SRL framework greatly improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated music. The performance of the suggested IGE-SRL method was evaluated in terms of precision (95.2%), F1-score (97.3%), accuracy (95.13%), recall (96.4%), and entropy (6.124). A greater sense of musical diversity and emotional coherence is confirmed by listener evaluations. By optimizing SRL parameters, the IGE approach enhances composition quality and convergence speed. With an emphasis on multimodal emotion modeling and real-time adaptive composition, the research advances affective computing and AI-driven music production.},

Multimodal visual networks are integrated to facilitate real-time interaction between artists and AI systems in creative situations. To combine the smooth, subtle textures of Chinese ink with the bright, textured brushstrokes of oil painting was used. To solve visual network problems, FFA-CausalConvoNet uses several layers and artists’ unique visual components to create works of art that mimic human efforts. The objective is to investigate the human-AI collaborative artistic production by creating a multimodal visual network that combines Chinese ink painting and Western oil painting by utilizing advanced AI techniques. A dataset containing labelled images of Chinese ink paintings and Western oil paintings was utilized for training. Gabor filters were used to capture texture and patterns, separating thin, smooth gradients of ink from rough brushstrokes of oil. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) are used for feature extraction and fusion, which improves texture and shape detection. The proposed generation method utilizes a Flexible Firefly Algorithm Driven Causality-Aware Convolutional Neural Network (FFA-CausalConvoNet) to blend these features and create hybrid artwork that performs well, successfully combining with different styles. The suggested method is implemented by using Python 3.10.1. The resulting artworks displayed a unique blend of the oil painting’s texture and the delicate brushwork of Chinese ink with style fusion accuracy (94.5%), text quality score (9.1 score), processing time (3.5 sec) and cultural fidelity (8.5 score). It highlights the potential of AI-human collaboration in making hybrid art, as the proposed model, FFA-CausalConvoNet, effectively incorporates the distinctive qualities of both art forms, opening up new paths for creative expression in cross-cultural art development.},

Through experimental validation, the model outperformed traditional methods in accuracy (86.9%) and recall (81.6%), particularly for long-sequence behavior data.

Taking nylon 6 (PA6) as the research object, combined with X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, the effectiveness of the algorithm in the evolution of crystal structure (α/γ crystal transformation) was verified. The research results show that the algorithm has been tested for its ability and scalability in processing data of different spatial dimensions, with a spacing of 5 between datasets. A simulated dataset with different clustering dimensions was established to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in different clustering dimensions of the data stream. It was found that the algorithm performed well in the spatial aspect of the data stream, had good scalability, and performed well for any clustering. It can effectively handle high-dimensional data and has higher accuracy than the CluStream algorithm due to its use of subspace clustering. Nylon 6 mainly exhibits different characteristic peak shapes, such as the alpha crystalline characteristic peak shape at 2θ = 19.8° and θ = 22.9°, and the gamma crystalline characteristic peak shape corresponding to the point at θ = 20.8°. In addition, diffraction peaks of the alpha crystal form were observed, attributed to the addition of apigenin in the range of 0.01–0.05%. The effect of apigenin on the transformation of PA6 from the γ crystal form to the α crystal form decreases as its amount increases. The diffraction peak of the γ crystal structure in the figure appears again at θ = 21.2, during which 1% apigenin is added. It is evident that the suggested approach can successfully and efficiently generate the condensed structure.

  abstract = {Given the challenges in capturing temporal dependencies within sports event data and the imbalance between global and local feature representations, this study introduces a Transformer-based model designed to address these issues. By leveraging a multi-head self-attention mechanism, the model effectively captures dynamic features across different time granularities, thereby enhancing the analysis of temporal event data and improving the accuracy of win rate prediction. Specifically, a time-segment encoding strategy is first employed to partition the event sequence data, enabling independent processing of features within each temporal segment. Subsequently, a multi-level Transformer architecture is constructed to extract both short-term and long-term dependencies at different hierarchical levels, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of game dynamics. To further refine feature representation, a dynamic self-attention adjustment mechanism is incorporated, allowing the model to adaptively focus on salient features based on the characteristics of the input data. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with baseline models—including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—the proposed model achieves superior performance. Specifically, it improves prediction accuracy by 10.7%, 8.3%, 3.9%, 6.0%, 4.3%, and 2.4%, respectively, and enhances precision by 10.6%, 9.4%, 5.0%, 6.5%, 4.5%, and 3.6%, respectively.

  abstract = {Background:
            Although cloud computing has been increasingly adopted in university information systems to support teaching, research, and administration, existing cloud service platforms still face significant challenges in two key dimensions: intelligent resource scheduling and comprehensive security protection.
            Problem:
            Most current resource allocation strategies rely on static models or heuristic-based rules, which lack adaptive capabilities in dynamic and high-load environments. Simultaneously, existing cloud security mechanisms often focus on traditional encryption methods or basic access control, which are insufficient for protecting sensitive data in open, high concurrency subsystems such as digital libraries.
            Proposed solution:
            To address these gaps, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture optimization and deep security design scheme tailored for university cloud platforms. The core innovation lies in the integrated application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and advanced cryptographic frameworks to achieve dynamic, secure, and efficient service delivery.
            Methodology:
            DRL is employed to build a system-aware, environment-adaptive resource scheduling algorithm that maps complex system states to optimal resource configurations in real time. For the security framework, this paper introduces a multi-layered encryption and access control strategy: attribute-based encryption (ABE) ensures secure data transmission, while the scheme is extended to Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy ABE (MABE) based on the Ring-LWE assumption, enabling decentralized identity access management (IAM) with formal security guarantees. In addition, a K-Means-based network log analysis mechanism is developed for real-time detection and classification of user behavior and potential attacks, forming a closed-loop system of threat perception, behavior recognition, and active response.
            Results:
            The experimental results show that the K-Means + ABE attribute-based encryption algorithm can be applied to the network information security management of LAN in terms of data. Compared with the classical heuristic-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and greedy algorithm, the fitness function value of the new algorithm in this paper is 4.4% and 5.6% higher on average, respectively, which can effectively balance the demand for QoS and resource cost.
            Significance:
            Therefore, the optimization scheme is superior to the traditional architecture design in response efficiency, resource utilization, and security performance. This paper provides a feasible theoretical basis and technical path for the construction of cloud platform under the background of university digital transformation.},

  abstract = {The new energy vehicle (NEV) industry urgently requires tailored credit assessment frameworks to address its nonlinear risk characteristics, driven by rapid technological iterations and policy dependency. This study selects 46 listed companies in the NEV supply chain (2019–2023) as samples, innovatively integrating multi-source data including financial metrics, textual tone analysis of annual reports, and ESG ratings. A three-dimensional composite indicator system (“financial robustness–strategic credibility–environmental resilience”) is developed to compare the predictive performance of Logit models and backpropagation (BP) neural networks in estimating corporate default probabilities. Empirical findings reveal: (1) Under the composite indicator system, the BP neural network achieves 81.7% default prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the Logit model (72.4%), with a 32-percentage-point improvement in identifying defaulted entities; (2) Using single financial indicators, the BP network maintains superiority (58.3% overall accuracy vs 48.3% for Logit), validating its capacity to capture complex risk features; (3) The composite system enhances prediction accuracy by 23.4% (BP) and 24.1% (Logit) compared to single indicators, demonstrating the early-warning value of non-financial metrics. These results suggest that the synergistic application of multi-source composite indicators and BP neural networks substantially improves the precision of dynamic credit risk assessment in the NEV sector, offering methodological support for differentiated financial services and regulatory oversight.},

  abstract = {How to fairly evaluate the state of the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem given the fast growth of creativity and entrepreneurial activities has become a crucial question. Conventional assessment techniques can depend on empirical indicators or basic statistical models, which are challenging to expose the complicated dynamic interactions and inherent rules of the system. Thus, this work suggests an intelligent evaluation approach including causal inference and deep representation learning for innovation and entrepreneurial environments. Deep representation learning extracts the system features; causal inference reveals the causal relationship between variables, so enhancing the operability and assessment accuracy. Specifically, the intelligent assessment method proposed in this study achieves a mean square error (MAE) of 0.149, which is significantly lower than other traditional methods. In terms of causal effect estimation, the estimation of this method is 0.92, which is much higher than other models. On structural Hamming distance (SHD), the present method is only 4, indicating its high accuracy in causal structure identification. The approach offers fresh concepts and technical support for the intelligent evaluation of ecosystems of innovation and entrepreneurship.},

  abstract = {In professional basketball games, athlete action recognition is an important part of sports performance analysis and intelligent assisted training. The complex scene background, frequent target occlusion, and varied motion patterns pose challenges to traditional detection and recognition methods in terms of accuracy and real-time performance. In view of this, the study proposes an improved object detection model for single shot multi-box detectors by combining pyramid feature integration module and dual axis convolutional perception module. At the same time, an action recognition model based on an improved 3D convolutional network is designed through adaptive weight fusion and attention mechanism. In the testing of the object detection model, when the number of iterations reached 500, the average accuracy improved by 6.14% and the frame rate decreased by 8.56%. The missed detection rate under low light conditions was 7.3%, the false detection rate was 8.7%, and the detection time was 30.8 ms. The highest detection accuracy of the action recognition model in complex backgrounds was 89.3%, and the robustness score was 91.9. The results indicate that the proposed model can maintain high accuracy and efficiency in complex backgrounds and fast movements in professional basketball game scenarios. The research model significantly improves the performance and robustness of action recognition, which can provide certain technical support for intelligent sports training systems.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel self-correcting convolution module that significantly differs from traditional convolution techniques by enabling multi-scale feature extraction through heterogeneous kernel processing and feature calibration. The module uniquely combines down-sampling and up-sampling operations within a single convolution block to capture both local and global contexts, addressing key limitations in existing methods. In addition, an improved Dice loss function is proposed, which integrates both under- and over-segmentation penalties through an mDice loss. This is combined with a cross-entropy loss based on classification to optimize segmentation performance. The proposed self-correcting convolution segmentation algorithm demonstrates superior accuracy in segmenting lung infection regions compared to existing methods, particularly the AMSU-Net network. Experimental results indicate that the inclusion of multi-scale spatial information and refined loss functions significantly enhances segmentation precision. The novelty of this research lies in the introduction of a self-correcting convolution module that improves the receptive field and the diversity of extracted features. Furthermore, the enhanced mDice loss function, integrating segmentation penalties, contributes to improved model performance. This method offers a promising advancement in lung infection segmentation using deep learning techniques.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the rapid rise of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed numerous domains, particularly smart homes. As people experience greater material comfort, they increasingly seek deeper, more emotionally intelligent ways to interact with technology. Music, rich in emotional content, serves as a powerful medium for interpersonal communication and is increasingly regarded as a natural channel for intelligent human-computer interaction. However, traditional music emotion recognition techniques face challenges with low recognition accuracy and high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient deep learning-based music emotion recognition system that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) within an IoT framework. The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract both local and global features from musical signals using Mel-frequency techniques. These features enhance the GAN’s ability to detect complex emotional expressions in music. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significantly lower error rates and greater recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it attains an accuracy of 94.06%, confirming its effective performance and suitability for real-time, emotion-aware music recommendation in IoT applications.},

  abstract = {During the operation of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, abrupt changes in load and input voltage can impact system stability and operating conditions. This paper addresses a dual-side coordinated control strategy that combines an advanced finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with impedance matching for LCC-LCC compensated WPT systems, aiming to enhance dynamic performance and optimize efficiency. Firstly, the secondary-side rectifier employs FCS-MPC combined with phase shift modulation (PSM) to achieve rapid voltage tracking. An improved FCS-MPC method is proposed featuring a novel iterative approach, adaptive compensation, and a multi-objective optimization cost function to simultaneously improve system stability, responsiveness, and computational efficiency. Secondly, the primary-side inverter combines impedance matching with PSM to track the point of maximum system efficiency. Finally, model verification results substantiate the viability of the developed strategy. Under sudden load and input voltage changes, improved MPC reduces overshoot and settling time by nearly 60% and 70%, respectively, compared to PI control. Additionally, system efficiency optimizes by approximately 1.3% through impedance matching.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of online education platforms has highlighted the critical need for accurate learner emotion recognition to improve interactivity and learning outcomes. However, conventional unimodal approaches face challenges in capturing the complex emotional cues embedded in learners’ language and speech. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel text-audio multimodal weighted network (TA-MWN) that integrates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for textual feature extraction and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for speech feature representation. These features are further processed through a multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal dependencies. The proposed multimodal weighted network (MWN) dynamically fuses the prediction probabilities from both modalities, enhancing sentiment recognition performance. Experimental validation on the public CMU-MOSI dataset demonstrates that TA-MWN outperforms traditional unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Further evaluation on a self-constructed online learning dataset confirms the model’s superior adaptability and recognition accuracy, achieving over 90% accuracy in negative sentiment detection. The proposed approach not only improves emotion recognition in online education but also provides a scalable framework for adaptive learning, personalized feedback, and privacy-friendly interaction without relying on visual data. These findings offer practical implications for enhancing learner engagement and emotional support in intelligent online learning environments.},

Optimising its structure can enhance gas recovery efficiency, reduce resource waste, and mitigate environmental pollution. This study designed three types of blast furnace metal bag filters with varying inlet and outlet structures and analysed their flow field distribution characteristics using computational fluid dynamics. The results indicated that the airflow was most efficient with the configuration of a lower inlet and upper outlet on the same side (Case A). However, Case A exhibited significant flow fluctuations in the filter bag area and slightly higher wall stress compared to the middle inlet structure (Case B). While the airflow in Case B's filter bag area was relatively uniform, there was strong disturbance at the ash hopper, hindering the efficiency of ash deposition. In addition, Case C, featuring a lower intake on one side and an upper outlet, demonstrated the poorest flow performance. Therefore, Case A was deemed the most scientifically optimal structure for the actual industry. Additionally, the study examined the impact of inlet velocity on flow characteristics in Case A. As the inlet velocity increased from 9.8 to 29 m/s, the flow velocity in the ash hopper area rose from 2.57 to 6.01 m/s, with a marked increase in jet intensity.},

Experiments show that our method can obtain an F1 value of 0.948, which can assist the upgrading and development of the cultural industry.},

  abstract = {The uptake of more-than-human thinking in geography seeks to centre the ways that our diverse life-worlds are sustained by interconnected and more-than-human relations. As a relatively new framework to the discipline, more-than-human thinking has offered different ways to address some of the world’s increasingly complex problems. But to what extent does this framework pay attention to the underlying context of Indigenous and settler colonial land relationships? And how might more-than-human thinking attend to complex problems such as researching on stolen Indigenous land? This article aims to take seriously the fact that tensions around settler colonial and Indigenous land relationships are not resolved, nor overcome by more-than-human thinking alone. We offer the Goats Foot Flower story, as told by Gumbaynggirr story-holder Aunty Shaa Smith, to share how diverse knowledges held within story are helping us to better understand what respectful land relationships might look like and mean. The story emphasises how heeding Country’s authority is foundational to maintaining respectful relationships with the land through living agreements. It teaches us that attending to respectful relationships on stolen land is an active and ongoing responsibility of continuing connections with and as Country. As we grapple with the complexities of what it means for each of us to be in respectful relationship with Country, we recognise that there is an urgent need to attend to Land Back as part of the process.},

However, traditional diagnostic methods suffer from issues such as insufficient feature utilization and poor model interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid fault diagnosis model. First, the model utilizes SHapley Additive exPlanations values for feature selection. Then, the improved Harris Hawks optimization is proposed to optimize the hyperparameters of eXtreme gradient boosting model (Xgboost), further improving the model’s classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods across multiple performance indicators, achieving an accuracy of 0.9509, which represents a 2.68% improvement compared to the Xgboost model. This model fully leverages the advantages of each method, effectively solving problems like insufficient feature utilization, poor model interpretability, and limited performance of optimization algorithms in traditional fault diagnosis methods.

  abstract = {The biocompatibility of the Ti6Al4V alloy is well known, due to its non-magnetic behaviour, low density, lightweight design and corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, the Ti6A14V alloy has many shortcomings, including a lack of antimicrobial activity, which raises the risk of implant failure and cellular toxicity. Considering this, research is being done to determine whether the cefotaxime (CTX) may efficiently suppress the corrosion of Ti6A14V alloy in artificial saliva solution using potentiodynamic polarisation curves, open-circuit potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As the inhibitor's concentration rose, so did the inhibition efficiency, achieving 82.0% at 600 ppm. The investigated CTX functions as a mixed-type inhibitor. Additionally, the adsorption of the CTX inhibitor followed the Langmuir isotherm. The temperature increased the corrosion current (

            ) and the corrosion rate. The barrier layer covering the surface of the Ti alloy was verified by the surface characterisation investigation using scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray. The predominant adsorption mechanism for CTX was physisorption. Moreover, quantum calculations have been carried out, such as density functional theory. Also, Monte Carlo simulations were used to comprehend the tested inhibitor's adsorption behaviour.},

This study enhances the allocation and administration of English translation resources in cloud computing. This study enhances cloud-based English translation services and influences language translation, natural language processing, and cloud computing. This research aims to provide a pragmatic method for the complex challenge of effectively allocating and managing English translation resources inside cloud computing networks. The algorithm is used to assess allocation and management techniques based on the characteristics of the ongoing activities and the status of the cloud network. The features include the computing capacity of edge servers and devices, the quality of the communication channel, the efficacy of translation resource use, and the latency requirements of the services. The proposed model can autonomously learn about the network environment and make decisions about resource allocation to enhance performance and minimize latency. The ability of cloud computing to project future trajectories from an initial state to ascertain the ideal action by evaluating reward values is a principal benefit of the system. This capability enables the system to choose the optimal course of action. The proposed strategy achieves substantial improvements in key performance indicators, including a 36.4% reduction in average service latency, a 24.7% gain in resource utilization, and a 3.5% improvement in translation accuracy. Additionally, the approach demonstrates excellent scalability, handling increased workloads with minimal impact on performance, and reduces costs associated with translation services, making it a cost-effective solution for cloud-based translation.

However, the high temperatures and mechanical stresses characteristic of automotive environments significantly impact the reliability and operational efficiency of these chips. FSDOI physical design strategies have emerged as a viable solution for enhancing the robustness and efficacy of automotive-grade semiconductor chips. Data are collected through both computational simulations and experimental investigations. The resulting data are analyzed using a variety of statistical methods, including failure rate analysis, which compares failure rates between chips optimized with FSDOI and those without. FSDOI emphasizes the fine-tuning of several aspects of the chip’s physical design to enhance performance. Thermal dissipation, mechanical stress, and electrical density were examined under automotive operational conditions, which include significant temperature variations and high humidity levels. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a sophisticated computational tool for modeling and solving large physical problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable elements. These elements are scrutinized to predict how the chip responds to various loads, pressures, and environmental conditions. Chips manufactured using the FSDOI technique undergo experimental tests to validate simulation results, including thermal and mechanical stress testing, as well as electromigration testing. The evaluations indicate that the FSDOI technique significantly enhances chip reliability and lowers failure rates. Findings underscore the necessity of incorporating advanced design optimization strategies into automotive chip production to fulfill the stringent requirements of modern automobiles. FSDOI-optimized chips exhibit a 48.15% reduction in failure rate, a 25% increase in Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), and a 35.48% improvement in overall reliability score. Mechanical stress resistance increases by 21.43%, while deformation under load decreases by 40%. Furthermore, thermal conductivity efficiency rises by 10.77%, and vibration endurance improves by 46.67%.

  abstract = {Real-time object detection and tracking are critical for applications such as robotics and autonomous systems. Embedded platforms present challenges in balancing speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Existing approaches often struggle to achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance within resource-constrained embedded systems. The main challenge remains in balancing detection speed, tracking consistency, and hardware efficiency for practical deployment. This work proposes a deep learning (DL) framework optimized for embedded systems, ensuring high accuracy, minimal latency, and efficient resource utilization for real-world applications. The framework integrates a novel Botox Optimization Algorithm-tuned Adaptive CNN (BOA-ACNN) for real-time object recognition and tracking.

The framework employs a Kalman filter for real-time motion prediction and noise smoothing, thereby enhancing tracking stability. Additionally, SIFT features are utilized to improve detection robustness under varying scales and environmental conditions. The system incorporates BOA for hyper-parameter fine-tuning and ACNN for efficient real-time detection and tracking, achieving latency of 97.5 μs, throughput of 200.4 activation/us, precision of 96.2%, recall of 97%, F1-score of 97%, mAP of 98.4%, and overall accuracy of 98.97%.

  abstract = {Research and development have demonstrated that effective building energy prediction is significant for enhancing energy efficiency and ensuring grid reliability. Many machine learning (ML) models, particularly deep learning (DL) approaches, are widely used for power or peak demand forecasting. However, evaluating prediction models solely based on accuracy is insufficient, as complex models often suffer from low interpretability and high computational costs, making them difficult to implement in real-world applications. This study proposes a multi-perspective evaluation analysis that includes prediction accuracy (both overall and at different power levels), interpretability (global/local perspectives and model structure), and computational efficiency. Three popular DL models—recurrent neural network, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, and three tree-based models—random forecast, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine—are analyzed due to their popularity and high prediction accuracy in the field of power demand prediction. The comparison reveals the following: (1) The best-performing prediction model changes under different power demand levels. In scenarios with lower power usage patterns, tree-based models achieve an average CV-RMSE of 13.62%, which is comparable to the 12.17% average CV-RMSE of DL models. (2) Global and local interpretations indicate that past power use and time-related features are the most important. Tree-based models excel at identifying which specific lagged features are more significant. (3) The DL model behavior can be interpreted by visualizing the hidden state at each layer to reveal how the model captures temporal dynamics across different time steps. However, tree-based models are more intuitive to interpret using straightforward decision rules and structures. This study provides guidance for applying ML algorithms to load forecasting, offering multiple perspectives on model selection trade-offs.},

By constructing a special data set containing 36 types of animated characters, the positive sample dynamic weighting strategy is innovatively designed to solve the inherent positive and negative sample imbalance problem of SSD model, and the receptive field enhancement module (RFB) is introduced to improve the multi-scale feature expression ability. The experiment shows that the mAP of the model increases by 13.8%. When the positive sample weight coefficient is 3, the identification effect is the best, which is 18.2% higher than that of traditional SSD. The improved SSD-RFB model detection accuracy (mAP@50 = 95.78%) and real-time (10.5 FPS) are superior to mainstream detection algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by the pose diversity of animation characters, and the synergistic effect of core modules is demonstrated through experiments.

However, anomaly detection in time-series data—especially data collected by edge devices—poses several challenges, including concerns over data privacy and communication overhead. To address these issues, this research proposes a novel deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection model capable of being trained in real-time on edge devices within an IoT environment. The framework ensures user privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to cooperatively train an anomaly recognition system. This study introduces a new, Intelligent Shark Smell Tuned Deep Isolation Forest (ISS-DIF), which effectively detects anomalies and identifies outliers in industrial IoT sensor data with high accuracy. The hybrid model isolates anomalies rather than profiling normal data, making it particularly suitable for identifying rare anomalies within large datasets. Industrial data are collected from real-world manufacturing environments using IoT edge devices. Following data collection, median filtering is applied to reduce noise, and min-max scaling is employed for data normalization. The ISS component allows for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the Deep Isolation Forest (DIF) to optimize detection performance. The DIF model is tailored to enhance anomaly detection capabilities in sensor data from industrial IoT applications. For validation, 80% of the dataset was used for training, while the remaining 20% served as the test set. The results demonstrate that the proposed ISS-DIF framework achieved superior training accuracy of 99.30%, with precision of 97.89%, recall of 98.76%, and an F1-score of 97.21%, outperforming the testing metrics.

  abstract = {An optimal location of perforation clusters is critical to obtain a commercial production rate in unconventional tight reservoir reservoirs. At present, the perforation cluster position design method based on overlapping induced stress between fractures is only suitable for multi-stage single-cluster fracturing in horizontal well. Under real well conditions, multiple fractures extend at the same time during multi-stage and multi-cluster fracturing, which is easy to produce stress barrier effects and stress interference effects. These problems put forward higher requirements for selecting the best position of perforating cluster. In this paper, according to the characteristics of multiple fractures extending simultaneously in one stage in multi-stage multi-cluster fracturing, the influence range of induced stress in one stage considering stress barrier and disturbance effect was analyzed. The mathematical model for calculating the induced stress at different locations in one stage is established considering the variation of effective net pressure to the surrounding formation and the resulted resulting distribution of induced stress. Based on this model, a multi-stage and multi-cluster fracture optimization design method for horizontal wells is proposed, which can effectively avoid repeated fractured and non-fractured areas by optimizing the non-equidistant locations of the perforated clusters. Case studies show that this method can effectively avoid refracturing and non-refracturing zones, thus achieving better fracturing results with lower energy consumption.},

This study introduces an advanced deep learning (DL) framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Elman Recurrent Neural Networks (ERNNs) to systematically assess and quantify the semantic features of modern ceramic materials. Data collected from 3D surface texture maps and high-resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images are used to train models capable of recognizing and segmenting complex microstructural patterns, including surface imperfections, crystallization stages, and fault types. The CNN model extracts hierarchical features from SEM images, while the ERNN generates synthetic high-resolution images for data augmentation, thereby improving segmentation accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform traditional methods, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 97.8%, an accuracy of 97.69%, and a precision of 95.32%. Additionally, the trained models facilitate precise reconstruction of 3D microstructures, revealing spatial distributions of phases that are challenging to capture with conventional imaging techniques.

  abstract = {The bogie is the most crucial component of a high-speed train’s (HST) running gear, directly impacting operational safety and passenger comfort. Major failures in bogie components can lead to severe vibration, performance degradation, and even catastrophic accidents such as derailments.

IntelliGraph captures structural relationships between bogie components through graph convolutions, while EVO optimizes model parameters to enhance diagnostic performance using sensor-derived synthetic vibration data. Two datasets are utilized: Dataset 1 simulates seven operational conditions (normal and six fault states) at varying speeds (80–200 km/h), and Dataset 2 includes 15 conditions (14 single-fault and normal states) at a fixed 200 km/h.

  abstract = {Smart grid systems necessitate robust data encryption to safeguard sensitive data. Hardware limitations and computational complexity, however, restrict the real-time applicability of encryption in certain smart grid environments. This investigation proposes a novel encryption algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm-Enhanced 8-Dimensional Chaotic System (GA-8D chaotic system), based on a complex chaotic system enhanced by a genetic algorithm, to secure smart grid data. The data was collected from a simulated smart grid environment, comprising real-time grid load data and sensor inputs. The proposed GA-8D chaotic system technique integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and an 8D chaotic system for strong key generation and encryption. This approach enhances encryption speed and security by evolving optimal parameters using genetic algorithms, thereby ensuring higher performance in smart grid applications. The 8D chaotic system encryption technique is utilized to securely encrypt data and sensor images within the smart grid, guaranteeing data integrity and confidentiality within the smart grid architecture. The proposed algorithm demonstrated superior performance in encryption speed (0.1 ms), training accuracy (0.98), security strength (98%), and computational efficiency (450 bits). The results indicate that the algorithm is scalable for smart grid data encryption. The GA-Enhanced 8D chaotic system encryption algorithm successfully addresses the security challenges in smart grid data transmission.},

  abstract = {Intelligent measurement terminals (IMTs) are key components in the power grid metering system. Detecting sensitive behaviors of the applications (Apps) installed on the IMTs is an effective means to prevent malicious behaviors and ensure the safety of the power grid. However, the traditional deep learning-based methods for sensitive behavior detection often suffer from performance degradation when the Apps change their behavior pattern after porting, migration, or upgrading. Retraining the network requires large quantities of labeled data, which is usually time-consuming and costly in practice. This paper proposes a new sensitive behavior detection method for IMT Apps based on the domain adversarial neural network (DANN). First, the DANN is utilized to extract the shared features of App behaviors before and after porting, migration, or upgrading, enabling the original data to be repurposed for training the new model, thereby alleviating the insufficient training data problem. Then, the distinctive features of the sensitive behavior in the new environment are extracted and fused with the shared features in the detection process to further improve the detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method attains 91.83% in detection accuracy, 91.21% in precision, 92.61% in recall, and 91.91% in F1-score, which are better than several traditional deep learning-based methods.},

  abstract = {The capacity of fractional-order differential equations (FODEs) to simulate intricate behaviors in nonlinear dynamic systems has drawn significant interest recently. A potent tool for characterizing memory and inherited characteristics present in several physical, biological, and engineering systems, FODEs involve derivatives of arbitrary, non-integer orders, in contrast to conventional integer-order differential equations. The goal of this research is to extensively examine the stability and control techniques of nonlinear FODEs, addressing their vital significance in modeling and managing nonlinear dynamical systems. Lyapunov-based stability is used to theoretically prove a stability theorem, offering a strong basis for fractional-order (FO) system analysis. A linear state feedback controller is designed, specifically to maintain a class of FO nonlinear systems to preserve system stability. The pole placement method from linear FO control theory is used to establish a novel criterion for calculating controller gains. The suggested method makes it possible to systematically select control settings, providing accurate nonlinear dynamics stabilization. Simulation investigations on the FO chaotic Lorenz system are carried out to verify the theoretical framework, and the intended stability and control performance are obtained. The outcomes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategies, offering significant insights for advancing the understanding and function of FODEs in complex nonlinear dynamic systems.},

  abstract = {In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have significantly changed the landscape of education. Among the most promising developments is the emergence of chatbot-based language tutors, which leverage AI to offer personalized and interactive language learning experiences. These tutors can assist learners in mastering vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and conversation skills across various languages. This research examines the role of chatbot-based language tutors utilizing deep learning (DL) to facilitate English language acquisition in mobile applications. Intent categorization is a fundamental component of these systems, allowing chatbots to understand user questions and respond appropriately. To address related issues, the research created a proofreading chatbot designed to help academic authors with grammatical corrections. Data was collected from a publicly available chatbot-based English learning dataset. The data was preprocessed using stop word removal and tokenization. Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is utilized to extract features from the preprocessed data. Efficient pigeon inspired fused bidirectional long short-term memory (EPI-BiLSTM) is applied to classify the intent based on the text to determine the user’s intent. After the classification, to address data scarcity in grammatical error correction for the English language, back translation is employed as a data augmentation tool. Back translation involves translating error-prone sentences into a different language and then translating them back to the original language, generating parallel corpora with their corrected counterparts, derived from texts. The experimental results demonstrated that EPI-BiLSTM outperforms traditional algorithms based on domain (80.5%), intent (90.3%), entity (75.2%), and average accuracy (81.3%). These findings illustrate the potential of combining chatbot-based systems and DL techniques to address both proofreading and grammatical error correction challenges in mobile applications.},

  abstract = {To enhance the utilization efficiency of recycled powder in concrete and address the research gap in traditional single-admixture studies of recycled concrete powder (RCP) and recycled brick powder (RBP), this study prepared RCP and RBP from construction waste (discarded concrete and bricks) and blended them at varying ratios (0:10, 2:8, 4:6, 6:4, 8:2, and 10:0) to produce recycled composite micro-powder (RCMP). The RCMP was then used to replace 20% (by mass) of cement in the production of C30-grade concrete. This research systematically investigated the effects of RCMP blending ratios on the workability and mechanical properties (at 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days) of concrete, while also elucidating the underlying mechanisms from a microstructural perspective. The results indicate that RCP and RBP exhibit irregular geometries, rough surfaces, and high water absorption. Their chemical compositions are similar to ordinary Portland cement, with RBP demonstrating higher secondary hydration activity than RCP. The incorporation of RCMP reduced both the workability and mechanical performance of concrete. However, at an RCP:RBP ratio of 2:8, the composite powder effectively leveraged the filler effect and pozzolanic properties. Compared to the reference group, the 90-day compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength decreased by only 9.86%, 4.05%, and 1.75%, respectively, while the failure process and modes remained consistent with standard concrete. Furthermore, the T2 relaxation spectrum of RCMP-modified concrete resembled that of the reference group, primarily exhibiting four peaks. The addition of RCMP optimized the pore size distribution within the concrete matrix, enhancing its overall compactness.},

                Democratic interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: This group aligns with Ambedkar’s emphasis on democracy as a means to empower marginalized communities. They view capitalism as a system that can coexist with social justice if regulated effectively. Their focus lies in harnessing democratic institutions to address economic disparities.
              
              
                Capitalist interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: In contrast, this interpretation advocates for a more proactive engagement with capitalism. They argue that economic development and entrepreneurship can uplift Dalits, aligning with Ambedkar’s belief in self-reliance. Their perspective seeks to leverage capitalist principles for Dalit advancement.
              
              
                Marxist interpretation of Ambedkarite thought: This faction aligns with the principles of Marxism, seeing capitalism as inherently exploitative. They draw from Ambedkar’s critiques of caste-based economic discrimination and advocate for a radical transformation of the economic system, aiming for socialist alternatives.

  abstract = {Frogeye leaf spot (FLS) is common in soybean cultivation and severely affects yield. Management practices for this disease include breeding resistant cultivars and applying fungicides. However, researchers often rely on traditional methods, such as visual identification, which are subjective and prone to errors. Machine vision and machine learning offer an alternative for FLS detection. This study proposed a segmentation method to extract disease spots from soybean leaves, using the hyper-green algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). A dataset consisting of 313 soybean leaf images, annotated with disease spots, was created. The PSO algorithm trained the data using a two-stage search strategy, comprising a coarse search phase and a fine search phase. The objective was to reduce the area discrepancy between predicted and annotated images by optimizing the weight values of the color components in the hyper-green algorithm. After optimization, the disease-to-leaf area ratio accuracy enhanced from 68.45% to 98.87%. The segmented images were analyzed, with 51 features extracted to construct a classification model. Three machine learning methods—random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—were utilized to create classification models for FLS, with all models optimized by the Bayesian optimizer. The RF and XGBoost models achieved accuracies of 94.76% and 94.22%, respectively, while the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.07%. The results indicate that this method serves as a reliable tool for the automated identification of FLS, enhancing both the efficiency and precision of soybean disease detection.},

Focusing on the writing characteristics of Chinese handwriting, we have designed a new edge description feature called directional pixel angle (abbreviated as DPA). The motivation for this feature comes from forensic handwriting analysis, where the long basic strokes in Chinese characters typically have a habitual inclination angle that is highly correlated with the writer’s identity. This paper focuses on four basic strokes in Chinese characters—horizontal, vertical, left-falling, and right-falling—and calculates the relative positional relationships of the edge pixels of these strokes. This paper design and extract first-order and second-order DPA features and apply them to writer identification tasks. Experimental results show that the writer identification performance based on this feature is comparable to that of mainstream CNN models and offers better interpretability.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the core issue in the field of green product design, the difficulty in accurately determining the importance of customer requirements due to their dynamic and time-varying characteristics. Existing research predominantly employs static weight allocation methods, which face limitations such as neglecting the dynamic evolution of market demands, bias from subjective experience, and challenges in quantifying environmental indicators. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a method that integrates fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to determine and predict the final importance of customer requirements in Quality Function Deployment for Environment (QFDE). First, by incorporating the expert experience of the QFD team, the customer preferences are combined with expert experience to correct situations where the importance is zero, determining the basic importance affecting customer requirements; then, based on the fuzzy data envelopment analysis method, the competitive differences of enterprises are evaluated from four aspects: the improvement ratio of customer green demand satisfaction, the feasibility of achieving the improvement goals for customer green demand satisfaction, the selling points of customer green demand, and the ability of enterprises to meet the environmental demand, in order to obtain correction factors for the basic importance, and then correct the basic importance to obtain the final importance of customer requirements; on this basis, the LSSVM model is introduced to predict the corrected final importance in order to grasp the trend of customer requirement changes.

The proposed method incorporates a dual-branch contrastive learning strategy that refines feature extraction from both video and text modalities while enforcing a fine-grained semantic matching mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic consistency loss function to penalize mismatches between generated captions and their corresponding video content. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves semantic alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art models in BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr scores.},

While data-driven deep learning models have shown promise in automating motion generation, they often lack biomechanical fidelity, leading to physically implausible results such as limb distortion and foot sliding.

Our model integrates bone length preservation, dynamic smoothness, and energy efficiency constraints directly into the training objective, ensuring structural consistency and motion naturalness. Moreover, semantic control vectors enable context-aware generation for diverse cinematic actions. Experiments conducted on Human3.6 M, CMU MoCap, and a curated film motion dataset demonstrate that BCMG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple biomechanical and perceptual metrics. Joint range heatmaps, center of mass trajectories, and motion embedding analyses further validate the physical coherence of the generated motion.

Initially, the framework harnesses pre-existing databases and labels for model pre-training, subsequently transferring the parameters from the pre-trained DKVMN model to the designated domain task via the transfer learning mechanism. This is followed by real-time updates and optimization of risk assessments using dynamic knowledge tracking. Post the pre-training and parameter transfer, the framework progresses to model training utilizing bespoke datasets and specific target labels, thus facilitating precise identification and management of enterprise risks.

The primary objective of this model is to address the traffic scheduling challenges in automated logistics transportation, enhance transportation efficiency, and minimize energy consumption. A novel model integrating the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) is proposed. SSA is first employed to optimize route planning, taking into account environmental factors such as traffic congestion, thereby providing a globally optimized initial solution. Subsequently, Bi-GRU adjusts the route in real-time according to historical data, including vehicle speed and cargo status. This integration fully exploits the complementary advantages of the two algorithms: SSA’s global optimization ability and Bi-GRU’s dynamic adjustment based on time-series information. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of this method can significantly reduce the unit transportation time of goods by 38.75% and the unit transportation energy consumption of goods by 23%.

  abstract = {Aiming at the low efficiency and accuracy of traditional methods in mask optimization of integrated circuits, a mask optimization algorithm based on deep learning is proposed. Firstly, an improved generation countermeasure network (GAN) model is designed. By introducing multi-scale feature fusion module and attention mechanism, the detail generation ability of mask pattern in lithography proximity effect correction is improved. Secondly, a dynamic weight adjustment strategy is proposed to adaptively balance the optimal weights in different regions during the training process. In the aspect of FPGA acceleration, a customized hardware architecture is designed for the computing bottleneck of the optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional OPC algorithm, this method significantly shortens the optimization time, improves the speedup ratio on the FPGA platform, and maintains a low edge placement error (EPE).},

  abstract = {Effective analysis of biomechanical motion data is crucial for predicting and preventing athletic injuries. Recent advancements in wearable sensor technologies offer extensive multimodal physiological datasets, yet integrating these complex data streams into accurate, interpretable predictive models remains challenging. In this work, we propose the BioSensor-Transformer, a novel Transformer-based deep learning architecture explicitly incorporating biomechanical constraints and multimodal sensor integration to predict injury risk during dynamic human movements. The model integrates inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), and plantar pressure sensor data, enhanced by biomechanical constraints that promote stable joints, smooth muscle motion, and efficient energy use. Extensive experimental validation on benchmark-aligned synthetic datasets demonstrates that BioSensor-Transformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.94, F-AUC: 0.83) and exhibiting physiologically plausible outputs. Moreover, our model provides enhanced interpretability through physiologically grounded attention mechanisms, enabling clear, actionable insights for clinicians. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between high predictive accuracy and biomechanical realism, providing substantial improvements for real-world injury prevention and rehabilitation applications.},

  abstract = {Accurate time-series classification (TSC) remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning due to the complexity and variability of temporal patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU have shown promise in modeling sequential dependencies, they often suffer from limitations like vanishing gradients and high computational cost when handling long sequences. To overcome these issues, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the Inception architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives due to their ability to capture multiscale local patterns efficiently. In this study, we propose InceptionResNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates the residual learning mechanism of ResNet into the InceptionTime architecture. By replacing the fully convolutional network (FCN) shortcut module in InceptionFCN with ResNet-50, the model gains deeper representational capacity and improved gradient flow during training. We conduct extensive experiments on the UCR-85 benchmark dataset, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, including InceptionTime, InceptionFCN, ResNet, FCN, and MLP. The results show that InceptionResNet achieves superior accuracy on 49 of 85 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse and complex time series data. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiscale feature extraction and deep residual learning to advance the performance of TSC models in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness of results when machine learning and natural language processing tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a ’human-in-the-loop’ methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using machine learning and natural language processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for computational grounded theory that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while maintaining the rigour of established grounded theory methodologies. To illustrate the framework’s value, we present the results of testing it on a dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors’ experiences in the gig economy.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades across New South Wales and Queensland, koala populations have been in steep decline. Despite being nationally listed as Endangered in 2022, populations have not been stabilised and threats to the long-term survival of koalas remain. Climate change predictions suggest that human-occupied coastal habitats may offer greater protection to koalas from natural disasters such as drought and wildfires, presenting a role for people to play in koala conservation. However, the design of conservation programs is rarely informed by the affected audiences themselves, lowering their probability for success. Acknowledging the need to centre approaches on people who don’t typically think about conservation, this study applied the 5-step design thinking process, a participatory research method focused on driving innovation. A one-day design thinking workshop was conducted in September 2024. Seven design teams were formed and tasked with developing an initiative to support the reporting of koala sightings through citizen science. Each team included participants with diverse experience and expertise, ensuring balanced representation across roles. During the design process, teams received feedback from a citizen jury before presenting final pitches. Citizen jurors were individuals with no prior experience in citizen science or koala conservation. Every participant was given a budget to invest in their favourite design. The top three citizen science program concepts featured customised apps with functionality such as auto-recording koalas, sharing information with other users, and fostering social connectivity. The juries’ selections focused on business partnerships, incentives, and tailored information for users. Notably, the jury selections did not overlap with the top three designs chosen by workshop participants. The inclusion of a citizen jury in a one-day design thinking workshop is a novel contribution. The utility of design thinking as a participatory method is discussed alongside the study’s limitations, offering avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Background:
            By combining existing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data with the economic conditions of different regions, we can better understand disease trends and make more accurate estimations, facilitating effective public health interventions. Medical institutions can consequently allocate resources more efficiently. For patients, this helps lower disease risk and reduce the overall disease burden in affected areas.
          
          
            Methods:
            We analyzed health patterns in 204 countries using GBD 2021 methodologies and conducted separate analyses of disease burden in China and worldwide. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs). We further assessed disease status by incorporating Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) values. In addition, we used Mendelian randomization to identify factors leading from falls to thoracic rib fractures, and we investigated the key protein involved in thoracic rib fractures through detection of 4907 plasma proteins.
          
          
            Results:
            From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) generally showed an upward trend, although male ASIR, and ASPR displayed a slight decline. In China, however, ASIR and ASPR reached a turning point in 2000, dipped in 2005, then trended upward again. Morbidity and prevalence were negatively correlated with SDI. Based on Mendelian randomization analyses, falls leading to thoracic rib fractures were linked to education level and osteoporosis. Moreover, HAMP was identified as the key protein in thoracic rib fractures.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            As global populations age, analyzing the global burden of thoracic rib fractures caused by falls from 1990 to 2021 can help guide the development of effective public health prevention strategies and optimize the allocation of existing medical resources.},

  abstract = {In this study, reliability methods were demonstrated as a promising approach in medical engineering by identifying the most significant muscle forces affecting femoral stress. First, the finite element method (FEM) in Abaqus software was used to model the effects of 10 muscle and joint forces across various regions of the femur. Then, using the response surface methodology (RSM), and examining the effect coefficients of each joint and muscle force, the hip joint reaction force with an impact coefficient of 210.97 was identified as the most effective force on bone stress. After that, the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius muscle forces were ranked second and third in terms of stress effect with coefficients of 66.6 and 34.47. This study showed that the anterior femoral muscles have a significant effect on stress compared to the posterior femoral muscles. RSM enables faster and more precise identification of joint and muscle forces influencing femoral stresses compared to conventional methods. This innovative approach not only increased the understanding of biomechanical phenomena, but also provided a more efficient tool for investigating and optimizing such processes in biomedical engineering applications.},

Filtering is shown to maintain machine learning performance on both synthetically generated and real world datasets while providing orders of magnitude speedup depending on how intensive of filtering is done.

Younger students tended to be approached with more teacher-facilitated creativity boosting activities like brainstorming and questioning. Older students required less guidance to demonstrate creative behaviors. All teachers established a supportive climate and offered open-ended activities for creative expression. The enrichment context allowed greater freedom in teaching creatively compared to traditional classrooms.

In the encoding stage, EfficientNet-B0 serves as the backbone network, combined with the SEBlock mechanism and residual blocks to enhance the extraction of key liver features and address gradient-related issues. In the decoding stage, deconvolution and upsampling are used for precise segmentation. Liver images from open-source websites are pre-processed and data-augmented to construct the G dataset. The EABRDeNet model is trained on this dataset, and segmentation results are obtained through the weight-sharing mechanism. To verify the model’s effectiveness, comparative experiments are conducted on the G dataset with U-Net and U-Net + Dice_Focal_Loss. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and Dice coefficient are used for evaluation. The experimental results show that the EABRDeNet model outperforms the other two models. Specifically, on the training set, the EABRDeNet model has an average loss of 0.0025979, an average accuracy of 0.9876249, and an average Dice coefficient of 0.985658. On the test set, the average loss is 0.0029967, the average accuracy is 0.987649, and the average Dice coefficient is 0.9845206. In contrast, the U-Net model and U-Net + Dice_Focal_Loss model have relatively higher losses and lower accuracies and Dice coefficients, indicating that the EABRDeNet model has better performance and stability in liver image segmentation tasks.},

Tri-modal amorphous powders were mixed at various ratios, achieving over 90% relative density with derived ratios by machine learning, significantly outperforming conventional trail-and-error methods. Enhanced core density improved magnetic properties, including a 49.7% reduction in coercivity and an 8.72% increase in saturation magnetization. These improvements were attributed to reduced porosity and optimized compaction strategies. Core loss analysis further demonstrated lower hysteresis and eddy current losses in high-density cores.},

  abstract = {The development of characteristic towns plays a crucial role in promoting rural revitalization, advancing China’s new urbanization efforts, and increasing farmers’ incomes. The integration of culture and tourism can enhance the appeal of tourist destinations while preserving local culture, mitigating the impact of tourism seasonality, and fostering the high-quality, sustainable development of the tourism industry. This study analyzes the key factors influencing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of cultural and tourism integration in the characteristic town of Conghua, Guangzhou. By applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the study calculates the weights of each influencing factor. Additionally, through a questionnaire survey, the strength values of these factors are derived, and the overall factor strengths are computed based on both the weights and strength values. A countermeasure quadrilateral is then constructed to determine the optimal development strategy for cultural and tourism integration in the town. The results indicate that the total intensity of opportunities is 1.493, the total intensity of advantages is 1.274, the total intensity of disadvantages is −0.292, and the total intensity of threats is −0.288. The conclusion shows that the integration of culture and tourism in small towns with Chinese characteristics should adopt the development strategy of quality growth.},

The convergence of SDN and IoT has brought new opportunities and challenges to the film industry. We focus on the emotional information extraction in films to provide a novel perspective for intelligent film evaluation. Firstly, leveraging speech recognition and natural language processing techniques, we utilize the BERT model to encode the text data of lines, followed by the Bi-GRU model for emotion classification. The results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy for exciting, sadness, and angry emotions exceeds 80%. Through comparisons with RNN, LSTM, and BI-LSTM, the BERT-Bi-GRU method shows higher precision in intelligent movie emotion extraction and enables intelligent evaluation. This approach not only offers new insights for the development of the film industry but also provides technical support for the standardization of the film production process in the era of SDN-IoT integration.},

In the occurrence of Cattaneo-Christov mass and heat flux, mathematical modeling and analysis have been performed. This model is useful for optimizing the design of systems that involve non-Newtonian fluids, like oil drilling, polymer extrusion, and chemical reactors. To optimize thermal management in high-performance machinery, it aids in a more precise knowledge of heat and mass transport mechanisms. This model can be applied to environmental processes such as the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere or the cooling of electronic equipment, where fluid dynamics and heat regulation play crucial roles, by incorporating dust particles and surface tension gradients. For both liquid and dust particle phases, the governing non-linear PDEs (partial differential equations) are composed of the principles of momentum, mass, energy, and solutal conservation. By using the similarity variable, PDEs can be transmuted into ODEs (ordinary differential equations). The numerical results of the governing equations are obtained using the shooting approach (RKF-45th). The skin friction, fluid and dust velocity distributions grow as the value of the Stephen blowing parameter upsurges while decline the rate of heat and mass transmission.},

Based on this, a mathematical model for optimizing the structure of the magnetic coupling mechanism among transmitter and receiver coils was established. Optimal parameter values were determined using an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm (EAPSO).

Working from the disciplines of geography and anthropology and from different – and in some respects, even opposed – theoretical starting places, we explore the tensions that arise among competing critical materialisms when the radical differences of nonterrestrial places form the contexts for social, political-economic, and human-nonhuman relations and relationality.

  abstract = {High-speed railways are highly sensitive to mining-induced subsidence, making the identification of goafs along railway corridors and impact assessment crucial for construction and operation. This study investigates the Weiyuan section of the Chengdu-Kunming High-Speed Railway traversing a low-mountain coal mining area. An integrated approach combining historical data, drilling surveys, InSAR monitoring, and theoretical modeling was used to map mineral resources, mining activities, goafs, and surface deformations. Then, an evaluation framework for assessing the potential impact of goaf on railway engineering stability is established, thereby evaluating the potential threat of goaf. Findings indicate that the overlying thick-bedded sandstone layer (∼129 m) above the goaf significantly mitigates the transmission of deformation from the goaf to the surface. InSAR monitoring spanning from November 2016 to April 2024 reveal that historical mining caused minor subsidence (&lt;10 mm/yr), with current deformation rates generally within ±10 mm/yr. Empirical calculations indicate a safe mining depth threshold of 96 m, while actual depths significantly exceed this value, posing minimal railway risks. By calculating the influence angle of the subsidence basin and analyzing its relationship with the railway alignment, the study identifies that the direct impact of goafs is primarily concentrated in the Bakubutian coal mine areas. Based on these findings, targeted risk mitigation strategies are proposed to ensure the long-term safety and stability of railway engineering. This study provides scientific support for the Chengdu-Kunming Railway’s safety and offers transferable methodologies for railway projects in similar mining-affected regions, emphasizing the importance of integrated geological-engineering assessments in infrastructure planning.},

  abstract = {A novel fault diagnosis approach for rotor systems experiencing pedestal looseness is introduced, utilizing complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to address this mechanical issue. In cases of pedestal looseness, rotor system vibration signals predominantly consist of three constituent elements: periodic components reflecting rotational frequency and harmonic content, transient impact components carrying fault characteristics, and stochastic noise interference. The CEEMDAN technique is employed to isolate and enhance the diagnostically critical impact elements within these complex vibration signals, followed by application of envelope demodulation analysis to process the extracted transient features. The diagnostic identification of pedestal looseness is ultimately achieved through characteristic periodicity detection in the resulting envelope spectrum. Validation through both simulated signal analysis and practical experimental investigations confirms the technical efficacy of this methodology for detecting pedestal looseness faults in rotating machinery rotor systems, maintaining fidelity to original operational data throughout the analytical process.},

  abstract = {Objective
            Recent studies show that the personality factors such as neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are linked to depression. This paper presents a computational model, PDScore, to explore the relationship between personality traits and depression scores obtained from an analysis of social media text by monitoring individuals’ social media posts over a specified time frame.
          
          
            Method
            The study aims to understand how different personality traits influence depression levels. Using the 3-D psychological theory (VAD) proposed by Mehrabian as a foundation, initial depression scores are derived. Subsequent analysis employs fuzzy logic to account for uncertainty arising from personality variability, resulting in refined depression score estimations.
          
          
            Results
            Validation is performed in two ways: using the eRisk2018 Dataset and Expert-Supervised Validation Using Psychometric Tools. First, the results are compared with eRisk2018 datasets and compared with the existing models. The proposed model outperformed all the existing methods with 0.84 F1-score. Then, a data is collected from 57 participants with approximately 35 to 40 posts per participant, resulting in a total of over 2150 posts. we applied our method to compute corresponding depression scores and compared them with the psychologists’ assessments. It demonstrates a correlation of 0.985 between the manual score and final depression score. The comparison yielded an accuracy of 94.7% in classification and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.089, indicating strong alignment and reinforcing the empirical validity of the proposed model. We consider this initial study a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the feasibility and potential of integrating personality factors and linguistic features for depression scoring.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The paper delves into the methodology and findings in detail, shedding light on the complex interplay between personality and mental health in online information contexts. The results reveal that personality plays an important role in estimation of depression score.},

However, a significant gap remains between their performance and theoretical potential, highlighting the urgent need to enhance our understanding of the process-structure-performance relationship. Computational simulations, with their ability to provide analysis from the atomic level to higher-scale, are essential for bridging this gap. This review provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in computational simulation techniques to produce high-performance PANCFs by optimizing the process parameters through simulations. Furthermore, advancements in reactive molecular dynamics, density functional theory, atomistic modelling, and finite element methods to enhance the PANCFs manufacturing process are systematically evaluated. Simulations play an important role in developing PANCFs by identifying novel comonomers for PAN precursors, evaluating different solvents during spinning, precise tracking of cyclization and dehydrogenation mechanisms during stabilization, and predicting mechanical property losses due to defects. Moreover, it is demonstrated that how kinetics-driven frameworks accelerate carbonization simulations by combining atomic-scale interactions such as carbon ring formation and graphitic growth with macroscale process parameters like temperature and pressure. However, certain limitations remain: unresolved heterogeneous microstructure representation, multiscale disconnects between atomic bond-breaking and macroscopic fiber evolution, and validation barriers due to oversimplified quasi-2D models. To overcome these problems, possible future directions including advanced force fields, multiscale integration, and AI-driven modeling could enhance the performance of PANCFs.},

In this paper, we propose an image stitching method based on multi-stage feature matching and GAN for autonomous vehicles. It consists of a stitching network, an optimization network, and a GAN framework. The stitching network employs deformable convolutions to match the nonlinear contour features of the same object among images from different viewpoints, and extract the homography relationship to warp the images and perform dynamic fusion. The optimization network adopts a skip connection structure to fuses feature maps of different scales. To further improve visual quality of image stitching, a GAN framework is employed to provide feedback to the model during the training process and guide it to produce seamless image stitching results. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed image stitching method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Expressive ability, language culture, internal and external classroom environment, and teaching style all positively influenced teaching innovation, with regression coefficients of 0.436, 0.061, −0.146, and 0.396, respectively. But the expressive ability and teaching style were significant, while the remaining two dimensions were not significant. The results of the path analysis showed that all the hypotheses in the model were tested and the path coefficients obtained from the test, and the corresponding chi-square significance coefficients met the requirements. The study enriches the theory of pedagogical innovation and exposes the role of the joint linguistic perspective of sustainable education on pedagogical innovation.},

  abstract = {As energy transformation and technological advancements accelerate, multi-load forecasting serves as a key component in optimizing the planning, operation, and management of smart grids. Nevertheless, conventional load prediction techniques often suffer from issues such as limited accuracy and high volatility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a load prediction approach based on Transformer multi-model fusion, employing a Stacking ensemble learning framework to integrate multiple models, including Transformer, XGBoost, and GDBT. The method also takes into account key influencing factors, such as meteorological conditions and holidays. Specifically, it involves training and predicting from the original features, followed by utilizing Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to capture feature relationships and long-term dependencies, ultimately leading to more precise load predictions. Empirical results validate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy and stability across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over single-model approaches and conventional techniques.},

This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to address these challenges. Initially, quantitative modeling of uncertainty factors within distribution networks is conducted, establishing a source-load output model. Subsequently, the correlation between photovoltaic generation and electrical loads is investigated, leading to the development of a probabilistic power flow calculation method that accounts for this correlation. Finally, an optimization framework is constructed with the objective function of minimizing planning costs. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in reducing network losses and minimizing network planning expenses.

  abstract = {This paper aims to establish a predictive model for hydro turbine failures by simulating rare real-world data using a digital twin system. Hydro turbines play a critical role in the renewable energy sector, but their unpredictability in terms of failures results in significant maintenance and operational costs. The traditional fault prediction method based on historical data is difficult to achieve more accurate and generalized modeling, because the data in the real world cannot meet the requirements of the machine learning theory for the same distribution of data and data balance, especially some rare events are difficult to collect in reality. Therefore, in this paper, it is proposed to enhance the robustness of hydro turbine failure prediction by simulating data from some rare situations through a digital twin system. By collecting and simulating rare data from actual hydroelectric turbines, we gain a better understanding of their operational mechanisms and fault patterns. We propose a digital twin system capable of replicating real-world operating conditions in a virtual environment, which serves as the foundation for data-driven fault prediction models. Through deep learning analysis of the simulated data, we can predict the likelihood of hydro turbine failures, thus improving maintenance strategies, reducing costs, and enhancing turbine reliability. Our research offers a promising approach to addressing rare data challenges using digital twin systems and holds broad application potential within the hydropower industry.},

The experimental results show that the feature-optimized linear hybrid model outperforms the traditional method in terms of prediction accuracy, with an average absolute percentage error of 0.040 and a root-mean-square percentage error of 0.074. In addition, the model’s prediction error during the Double 11 period is maintained at −8% to 2%, which is highly practical and effective. The model is highly practical and effective.

The platform contains a variety of proprietary seismic data in different formats and from different data sources, providing data support to realize the data modeling and business process processing of strong and impending earthquake prediction model, so as to build a new model of regional earthquake forecasting study. In this work, we perform data organization of relational databases, and after graph database modeling and data import, we build knowledge graph using HugeGraph, a kind of NoSQL graph database, which organized easily extensible architecture that can be easily scale to new nodes and relationships when generates new data . We use WebGIS technology to build intuitive interfaces to visual graphical databases for user interaction, querying, and roaming the SKG. We illustrate the possibility of using a graph database to build a knowledge graph for seismic forecasting, which establishes a seismic forecast base database, a distributed database system for proprietary earthquake data.

  abstract = {Background
            Disease-modifying therapies for persons with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has led to greater need and demand for relevant outcomes assessments. Such tools help monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and inform clinical management. Canadian SMA clinicians participated in a Delphi process to achieve a 2021 national consensus on recommended outcomes, recognizing future reassessment would be essential given the evolving field and gaps in patient-reported and bulbar measures.
          
          
            Objective
            Derive updated Canadian consensus of recommended outcome measures for adults with SMA.
          
          
            Methods
            A national consensus workshop was held with SMA clinicians, patient/family representatives, research leaders, national registry and advocacy organizations. Clinics and registry experience and data were presented and discussed, utility of current and additional outcomes reviewed. Long and short lists of measures were generated, with voting to derive consensus.
          
          
            Results
            Practical implementation, value of data, and relevance to persons with SMA were key considerations. Consensus was achieved to ‘think outside the box’, recognizing a spectrum of function and need to choose the right outcome measure for the right patient at the right time. Measures with greater acceptance for adults were selected, and bulbar measures introduced. Eight outcome measures are recommended; 4 motor, 2 respiratory and 2 patient reported domains, with use based on the individuals level of function. The Revised Upper Limb Module was deemed to have broadest applicability except in the strongest and weakest adults. Additional measures are included as optional and exploratory.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Employing measures meaningful for clinicians, researchers, and persons living with SMA is essential to ensuring quality data collection and an engaged patient-centred clinical team. Clinicians should select measures based on the person's functional ability and goals. Building a national community of practice to support clinical and research practice, including standardized outcome measure training, will be a key next step in dissemination and advocacy.},

  abstract = {Folk songs are a vital component of regional culture, distinguished by distinctive local traits and ethnic charm. Conventional classification techniques are insufficient for tackling the diversity and complexity of dialects in folk music. A new model integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers—TransCNN—has been developed to address this problem. This approach innovatively extracts local information from songs using CNN, thereafter encoding and decoding these features globally through the self-attention mechanism of Transformers. Furthermore, it employs diverse data augmentation techniques to strengthen the model’s capacity to identify the attributes of folk song dialects and elevate its overall efficacy. The evaluations revealed that TransCNN attained a classification accuracy of 92.3%, a recall rate of 91.8%, and F1 scores of 91.9%. The findings demonstrate that TransCNN effectively manages various audio kinds, background noises, and tonal variations, fulfilling the accuracy and reliability requirements for categorizing folk songs in the specified job.},

  abstract = {With the rise of popular music on the Internet, users need a powerful recommendation system to increase their subscription volume for music consumption. Research was done using deep learning techniques in streaming media platforms to convert audio signals into Mel spectrograms for extracting audio features. Under the computation of the Mel filter, feature extraction of audio files can be input into a binary network with platform user behavior, thereby constructing a music recommendation system. Finally, the relationship learning module is utilized to integrate user behavior and audio features, combined with a music encoder to complete personalized audio feature processing, thereby achieving the construction of a music personalized recommendation system. Through dataset testing, it was found that the initial dataset had a sparsity ratio of 0.14% and a recall rate of 30.16%. In the partitioning and data analysis of the Subset dataset, it was found that the user group recommendation algorithm had the highest recommendation accuracy of 24% for Subset100 subset, and the highest recall rate was 33.5% when the number of recommendations was 50, indicating the necessity of data recommendation. In the testing of the personalized recommendation system, the training accuracy of the system was as high as 93%. Finally, different recommendation methods were compared between the Subset500 dataset and the Mirex dataset, and the research method based on audio features had the highest recommendation accuracy of 97.5%, recall rate and F1 value of 42.1% and 58.81%, respectively, and a running time of 3.2 seconds, thus proving the excellent performance. The personalized recommendation system not only improves the predicted rating results of music in practical applications but also provides reliable technology for the future dissemination and development of popular music on the Internet.},

The system architecture consists of three distinct layers: the foundational data layer, the data processing layer, and the intelligent service. The improved CGWO-KM algorithm is used to cluster project attributes, and the search and update mechanism of the gray wolf population is applied to find better initial clustering centers. Missing rating data is then filled in, and user similarity is calculated. A harmonized weighting factor is used to eliminate the correlation between ratings from different users. The weighted rating mechanism comprehensively considers both user ratings and the influence of neighboring users. The improved Pearson correlation coefficient combines the weighting factors with user similarity to obtain the final recommendation score, completing the intelligent book recommendation process for the library’s books. The results show that at the 5th month time snapshot, the predicted data (6) for the library’s historical borrowing dataset closely matches the actual value (3.7). The method proposed in this paper demonstrates an IGD mean close to the true optimal solution across various library datasets for literature, science popularization, history, art, and novels, with values of 0.0012, 0.0023, 0.0014, 0.0021, and 0.0020, respectively. The optimal non-dominated solutions in the three-dimensional space for resource utilization, recommendation diversity, and user engagement are close to the ideal value of 1. Moreover, the book recommendation system has a short processing time, and the recommendation accuracy ranges from 0.882 to 0.993, providing personalized, high-quality book recommendation services for readers.},

  abstract = {In recent years, English language teaching has undergone significant transformation due to the integration of technology and innovative teaching methodologies. Among the most promising advancements is the formation of multimodal teaching, which incorporates various forms of media. Despite the potential benefits associated with multimodal teaching, challenges remain in tailoring content to individual learning needs and optimizing the learning process for maximum effectiveness. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Multimodal English Teaching Framework (METF) to enhance the effectiveness and personalization of language learning. The framework integrates multiple teaching modalities, including text, audio, video, and interactive elements, to accommodate diverse learning preferences. It incorporates student interaction data (responses, time spent on tasks, and engagement levels), learner demographics, learning styles, and feedback records, thereby capturing the effectiveness of personalized content delivery. Pre-processing steps, including tokenization for text data, noise reduction for audio data, and normalization for resolution and interaction data, ensure data quality and consistency. Feature extraction techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for audio and video data and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text data are applied to capture meaningful patterns. To enhance the fusion of multimodal data, feature-level fusion is implemented, integrating recovered characteristics from multiple modalities into a unified representation that supports more accurate decision-making. This research establishes the Resilient Genetic Algorithm (RGA) to enhance the adaptive learning process by ensuring robustness and avoiding premature convergence. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this multimodal approach, achieving 94.2% accuracy, a convergence time of 45%, task engagement of 89.4%, and personalization effectiveness of 91.7%. These results indicate a high value of accuracy in multimodal English teaching. This research highlights the applicability of algorithms in optimizing complex, multimodal educational environments.},

This study addresses these challenges by applying a machine learning (ML) algorithm, specifically the Polar Bear-tuned Multi-Source Kernel Support Vector Machine (PB-MKSVM), to predict and optimize the sprint performance of track and field athletes. The system analyzes essential biomechanical characteristics such as muscle activation patterns, joint angles, ground reaction forces, and stride length. Data were collected using wearable sensors and motion capture systems during standardized sprint trials, during which various biomechanical parameters were recorded. Standard preprocessing steps including noise removal and outlier detection were applied to the data. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was employed to extract features from the preprocessed data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in predicting sprinting efficiency and identifies complex, phase-specific changes in movement patterns. The model effectively analyzes the intricate biomechanics of sprinters’ movements to differentiate between various skill levels. Using Python software, the model achieved impressive performance metrics, including accuracy (94.5%), precision (92.7%), recall (93.6%), F1-score (92.1%), R
            2
            (0.92), and AUC (0.91), highlighting its robust predictive ability. This study illustrates how machine learning models can advance research in sprinting mechanics and provide insightful information to athletes and coaches seeking to improve performance.},

  abstract = {The quality and dependability of financial data depend on risk management in accounting systems. Traditional risk management approaches often fail to provide real-time insights into emerging risks, potentially leading to significant financial losses. Real-time analysis and decision-making are the main focus, investigating how artificial intelligence (AI) could improve risk management in accounting systems. For the precise prediction of possible risks, including fraud, errors, and financial misstatements, in accounting data, the examination suggests a hybrid Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (EFPA-GBM) model. The data was gathered, which included accounting records, financial transactions, and risk-related incidents. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing them to ensure quality, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. EFPA is utilized to improve the model’s parameters for increased accuracy, while GBM is utilized for risk prediction. This AI-driven model continually learns from data, which enables real-time risk analysis and decision-making in contrast to conventional rule-based systems. The performance metrics are evaluated by using Python software in terms of accuracy (94.2%), recall (94%), F1 score (92.9%), precision (93.8%),

  abstract = {Accurate PV power prediction is crucial in efficiently operating intelligent power grid systems. Data-driven approaches have shown high performance in predictive tasks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) merges deep learning with reinforcement learning and has been widely studied for optimization challenges in various fields. However, limited research has focused on applying DRL to ultra-short-term PV power prediction. Hence, a soft actor–critic (SAC) model using long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed for predicting PV power. To accomplish this, first, the PV power problem is modeled as a Markov decision process with historical weather data and PV power data as state inputs. Then, LSTM is integrated into the critic network of SAC to enhance its memory capability, thus improving prediction accuracy. Ultimately, the agent engages with the environment to address the optimization problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model attains greater prediction accuracy. This study explores the potential of DRL for PV power prediction, and the proposed method can be extended to other prediction fields, including grid prediction and wind power prediction.},

  abstract = {Current short video recommendation systems face challenges in accurately identifying user interests due to large-scale, heterogeneous user data, as well as addressing cold-start problems when encountering new users and content. This study proposes a deep learning and reinforcement learning (DLRL) framework to enhance recommendation performance. User and video data are collected and preprocessed using the Hadoop platform, while automated metadata extraction tools, optical character recognition (OCR), and audio-to-text technologies extract multimodal features, including subtitles and audio content. A convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts semantic and visual features from text-image data, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) network captures temporal dependencies in user behavior to detect interest changes. A multimodal attention mechanism integrates these diverse features to form comprehensive user portraits, and a deep neural network (DNN) reduces feature dimensionality to represent user preferences accurately. The recommendation process is formulated as a reinforcement learning task optimized through Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior click-through rates (6.22%), viewing duration (73.31 s), accuracy (0.877), and recall (0.858), effectively overcoming cold-start limitations and dynamically adapting to evolving user interests. This shows that combining DLRL can optimize the performance of short video recommendations, improve accuracy and experience, and address the issues of cold start and capturing changes in user interests.},

Players in games must quickly adapt to changing court circumstances, often adjusting tactics, but identifying the best course of action in real-time is challenging due to the complexity of handling data signals. This research explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating personalized training plans to improve basketball players’ abilities. Specifically, a novel Intelligent Cheetah Optimizer with Flexible Recurrent Neural Networks (ICO-FRNN) was proposed to generate training plans by identifying individual player strengths and areas for improvement. To get information from sensors during practice and competition, monitor physical performance indicators such as heart rate, speed, jump height, endurance, and biomechanical movements. The collected data undergoes preprocessing to address missing values, normalize data formats, and remove outliers by using Z-score normalization and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for feature extraction. The findings show that the ICO-RNN approach enables more intelligent, player-specific training plans, facilitating improved decision-making, skill improvement, and injury avoidance. Findings indicate that AI-driven personalized training plans result in notable performance gains when compared to conventional training regimens. The performance metrics are accuracy (0.9680), recall (0.9680), F1 score (0.9681), and precision (0.9700).

  abstract = {As photovoltaic (PV) systems become more widely adopted, maximizing their grid-connected capacity in urban settings is crucial for improving energy flexibility and reliability. While progress is being made in integrating PV with renewable energy sources, further research is required to comprehensively understand how urban PV systems can support the grid, particularly regarding flexibility and reliability. Most prior studies have concentrated on centralized, grid-level evaluations, often neglecting urban-specific variances and the real-time challenges of grid management. Additionally, the dynamic nature of PV power production and consumption patterns in rapidly urbanizing areas poses difficulties for conventional approaches. This study aims to evaluate the grid-connected capacity of PV systems in urban environments by utilizing advanced deep learning (DL) algorithms to optimize and adjust grid connection flexibility and reliability while predicting electricity demands in these areas. The KO-DynSpikNet model is employed to analyze historical solar power data, consumption trends, and grid stability indicators. The model is trained to estimate optimal PV capacity integration for various urban locations, taking into account weather variability, changes in energy demand, and grid constraints. Sensors are utilized for data collection, while discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and min-max scaling are applied for preprocessing and feature extraction. The results indicate that the DL model offers improved forecasting accuracy for grid-connected capacity compared to conventional methods. Enhanced PV system designs contribute to grid stability and increase flexibility in real-time energy distribution. This showcases how local energy networks can become more flexible and reliable while facilitating the adoption of environmentally friendly energy solutions in decentralized systems.},

  abstract = {In the rapid quotation process of construction projects, low prediction accuracy and high computational complexity remain challenging issues. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel method that integrates the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets for intelligent cost prediction. Given that engineering unit prices are significantly and dynamically uncertain due to multi-source heterogeneous factors (e.g., seasonal fluctuations, regional differences, and market volatility), we construct a transformation mechanism of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This mechanism expands the traditional deterministic engineering feature matrix into an information matrix that includes hesitation degrees and membership degrees, thereby achieving a refined representation of uncertain parameters. On this basis, we introduce a multi-dimensional similarity matching algorithm to establish an accurate mapping relationship between the project under construction and the historical case library. A weighted correction prediction model based on similar cases is proposed to enhance the robustness of unit cost prediction results. Verification through multiple engineering examples demonstrates that this method provides a new prediction paradigm for engineering cost estimation, combining both theoretical rigor and practical applicability. The research conclusions offer important references for the development of intelligent cost estimation systems and the optimization of engineering decision-making.},

Firstly, an improved Tent chaotic map is introduced to realize population initialization, so as to improve the quality of initial population distribution in the search space and its global search efficiency. Secondly, the adaptive T-distribution mutation mechanism is incorporated into the dung beetle position update to elevate the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of the algorithm. Finally, the equivalent partition model for active distribution network is established based on the “black box” theory to reduce the solving dimension of the algorithm and improve the location rate. The comparative experimental results of multi-verse optimization (MVO), red-tailed hawk (RTH), slime mould algorithm (SMA), and AC-DBO algorithm and the effectiveness simulation test results of hierarchical positioning model show that the average positioning accuracy of AC-DBO algorithm is increased by 15%, 10%, and 3%, respectively, compared with MVO, RTH, and SMA algorithms. After introducing the equivalent partition strategy, the average positioning time of AC-DBO hierarchical positioning model is reduced by 36.8% and 29.4%, respectively, compared with AC-DBO single-layer positioning model and DBO hierarchical positioning model and the average positioning accuracy is increased by 21% and 8%, respectively.

Half the participants were instructed to rate the beauty of pottery objects created by a renowned artist, while the other half engaged in a control task that did not involve evaluating beauty.

The wear model incorporates material properties, contact mechanics, and operational parameters, employing advanced finite element method to simulate real-world conditions accurately. Key variables such as material hardness and contact pressure are examined to determine their influence on wear depth. The simulation results indicate that wear is significantly affected by the surface hardness of the interacting materials. The liner experiences more wear than the piston ring due to its lower hardness and higher wear coefficient. The developed model is validated against Hertz contact pressures, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. In other words, the FEM results for contact pressure closely matched the predictions from the Hertz analytical solution. This study introduces integrating OpenFOAM simulation outputs as input for ANSYS APDL, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate wear analysis. Additionally, the wear simulation is conducted on a real large two-stroke engine, enhancing the practical relevance of the findings. This approach provides deeper insights into the wear behavior of piston ring–liner interactions under real-world operating conditions, offering a significant advancement over conventional modeling techniques.},

Five L-shaped frame models were developed using ABAQUS, with length-to-width ratios (L/B=) of 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, and 3:1. By comparing peak shear forces and bending moments at the tops of corner columns in the direction of excitation under earthquake wave passage excitations, this research highlights the impact of low-frequency content on wave passage effect. Findings show that when seismic waves contain sufficient low-frequency content, wave passage effect occurs in wave-facing outer corner columns, whereas inner corner columns do not. The last-arriving outer corner columns, however, displayed no consistent pattern. With the rise of the L/B ratio (when L/B = 3), the peak shear force and bending moment of the wave-facing outer corner columns go up by 13.8% and 7.1%, respectively. The last-arriving outer corner columns encounter up to an 11.1% increases in peak shear force and 10% in peak bending moment. When the seismic waves lack sufficient low-frequency content, the corner columns of the L-shaped frame structure are less likely to experience wave passage effect.},

  abstract = {In order to overcome the energy “hole” problem caused by uneven energy consumption of nodes in equidistant deployment, an unequal spacing optimization deployment method is adopted to deploy a chain type wireless sensor network to balance node energy consumption and extend the network life-cycle. Furthermore, a star-chain structure multi-chain wireless sensor network node optimization deployment method is adopted to deploy a two-dimensional monitoring network; Taking into account inter chain interference, network connectivity, and node energy consumption, the optimal node spacing and hop count for each chain, as well as the optimal number of chains in circular areas, are obtained. Through MATLAB simulation, it is proven that this deployment method can effectively reduce and balance node energy consumption, and maximize the network’s life-cycle.},

  abstract = {Traditional elderly care systems often rely on single-modality emotion recognition, overlooking the complexity and diversity of emotional expressions in the elderly. This study integrates three pre-trained models—VGGFace for facial recognition, DeepSpeech for voice analysis, and BERT for text processing—to develop a multimodal emotion recognition system that enhances intelligent and personalized elderly care. A high-quality emotion dataset is first constructed through comprehensive data collection and preprocessing. Transfer learning is then applied to optimize the three models, achieving precise facial, voice, and text-based emotion recognition. By incorporating feature-level and decision-level fusion strategies, the system improves recognition accuracy and robustness. A dynamic feedback mechanism further refines care strategies, ensuring a more adaptive and humanized elderly care experience. Comparative experiments show that the proposed system significantly outperforms existing models in emotion recognition accuracy (88.63%) and recall (85.93%), with an average response time of just 3.22 seconds. Moreover, after system implementation, the mental health scores of elderly participants improved, decreasing from 6.53 to 4.73 points. User feedback confirms the system’s effectiveness, with an average satisfaction rating of 4.33 across multiple care service dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal AI-driven emotion recognition in enhancing emotional well-being and mental health support for the elderly, offering a valuable reference for the future development of intelligent elderly care systems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based style transfer techniques have been employed to modify traditional woodcut paper horse art images. This art form struggles to maintain its cultural character while adapting to modern digital media. Style transfer, as a DL technique, allows for the combination of the innovative style of one image with the content of another, enabling the digital recreation of conventional aesthetics. Data collection involved the compilation of a dataset consisting of high-resolution images of traditional woodcut paper horse art. The dataset was preprocessed through normalization of image sizes, application of data augmentation techniques to enhance diversity and mitigate overfitting, and filtering of images to isolate specific features of paper horse art, including line work, shading, and texture. This research proposed the Intelligent Pied Kingfisher - Refined Convolutional Neural Network (IPK-RCNN) model, which is trained on both traditional woodcut images and modern digital art, aiming to create a hybrid style that respects traditional aesthetics while integrating contemporary stylistic elements. The style transfer process employs a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) that incorporates IPK optimization for the enhancement of convolutional layer weight parameters, thereby improving both efficiency and accuracy. The IPK-RCNN method effectively preserves the intricate textures and details of woodcut art while incorporating modern stylistic variations. The model achieves high-quality outputs, attaining a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 35.12 dB, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.90, and an efficient execution time of 31.17 ms. This approach underscores the potential of DL in the preservation and reimagining of traditional art forms for digital platforms.},

  abstract = {Emotion analysis in literary texts is a complex task due to the intricate nature of language, rich contextual dependencies, and subtle emotional manifestations present in narratives, dialogues, and poetic structures. Traditional lexicon-based models frequently fail to capture the complexity of emotions in literature, leading to incorrect classifications. This study examines the ability of BERT to enhance emotion analysis for literary texts. An innovative Dynamic Honey Badger-tuned BERT (DHB-BERT) model is applied to effectively detect emotional changes in literary texts. Training and emotion analysis are ensured through a diverse dataset of Chinese literary works, with accurate samples to evaluate the model. Lemmatization and stemming serve as preprocessing techniques that reduce words to their most basic forms to preserve continuity. Then, feature extraction is performed using Word2Vec, which maintains relevant linkages and captures emotional fluctuations. Based on the sentiment analysis, texts are classified as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. The Dynamic Honey Badger algorithm is employed for feature selection and adaptation of the dataset for improved emotion classification. The BERT model is then utilized to capture meaningful emotional variations across various literary forms. This simulation is executed using a Python platform. To evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation, various performance metrics are employed, including precision (94.76%), recall (95%), accuracy (95%), and F1-score (94.13%). Experimental results indicate that the DHB-BERT model significantly outperforms traditional algorithms, particularly in handling rhetorical language, irony, and nuanced emotional manifestations. This research highlights the potential of transformer-based architectures in advancing sentiment analysis for literary texts, providing valuable insights for computational linguistics, literary studies, and sentiment-aware systems.},

  abstract = {Background
            Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Awareness and the evidence supporting the merits of palliative care (PC) approaches to people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are increasing.
          
          
            Objective
            This review aimed to address four key questions related to PC for PwPs and their caregivers: i) What are the indicators for timely access to PC? ii) When should PC be introduced? iii) What are the current care models for providing PC? iv) What are the barriers and facilitators at the organizational level?
          
          
            Methods
            A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (2006–2024). Six reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts, and thematic synthesis was applied to develop analytical themes. Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines.
          
          
            Results
            Out of 894 studies, 70 were included. PwPs were infrequently referred to PC services, and while several referral criteria were identified, no consensus emerged. Barriers to accessing PC included insufficient information, inadequate education, difficulties determining referral timing, limited home-based care options, inconsistent provider support, and disparities linked to socioeconomic and cultural factors. Facilitators included improved care coordination and education for PwPs, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Effective PC models were identified, including home-based, hospital-based, and community-based approaches, which improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Establishing consensus on referral timing and criteria is essential for integrating PC into Parkinson's disease care. Overcoming barriers requires enhanced education, better care coordination, and targeted interventions to address disparities, ensuring comprehensive, patient-centred care for PwPs and their caregivers.},

  abstract = {In alpine and canyon areas, the problems of reservoir bank deformation and landslides are prominent. How to quickly and efficiently monitor deformation, timely identify geological disasters, and carry out surveys and treatments has become a crucial issue to be resolved urgently. Traditional survey methods are restricted by factors such as steep terrain and inconvenient transportation, resulting in low efficiency. In recent years, remote sensing technology has developed rapidly in the field of geological disaster monitoring, thanks to its high-precision deformation monitoring capabilities. This study is based on the Baihetan Hydropower Station during the water storage stage. The InSAR deformation monitoring technology is used to conduct large-scale disaster risk screening of the reservoir bank slopes. Firstly, the study analyzes the characteristics of UAV laser point clouds and images to construct a point cloud sequence. Subsequently, an improved iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that integrates the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and cylindrical neighborhood search is applied to improve the accuracy of slope deformation extraction. Finally, with the help of recognition algorithms and practical engineering experience, the surface deformation is analyzed based on the measured terrain data. The research shows that the surface deformation recognition technology based on UAV inspection and InSAR data has significant advantages in the monitoring of geological disasters in reservoirs in alpine and canyon areas. It can detect potential hazards in a timely manner and provide key decision-making basis for engineering projects.},

  abstract = {Machine translation (MT) for underrepresented languages, such as Xhosa, presents significant challenges due to limited linguistic resources and the complex nature of these languages. This research proposes a novel approach to improve MT accuracy for Xhosa-to-English translation using Adaptive Gradient Boosted Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (AdaGrad-BBERT). This method combines the powerful capabilities of BERT with adaptive gradient boosting, enhancing contextual understanding and overall translation accuracy. The system integrates a series of preprocessing steps to optimize model performance. Initially, the dataset undergoes text cleaning, including the removal of noise, normalization of punctuation, and correction of spelling inconsistencies. Tokenization uses BERT’s word-piece model, effectively handling rare and out-of-vocabulary words. Part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing are applied to capture syntactic relationships specific to Xhosa, which has distinct grammatical structures compared to English. Pre-trained BERT embeddings are employed to generate rich, context-sensitive representations of Xhosa words, ensuring more accurate translations. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism is fine-tuned using the AdaGrad-BBERT optimization technique. Translation quality is evaluated using the BLEU score, and model performance is assessed over multiple training epochs. Simulations are conducted using the TensorFlow framework to train and evaluate the model on the Xhosa-English dataset, with results demonstrating significant improvements in translation accuracy, the BLUE score increased 0.896. The proposed system highlights the potential of AdaGrad-BBERT in bridging the gap in MT for underrepresented languages, offering a scalable solution for enhancing MT. This solution holds promising applications in education, cross-cultural communication, and digital inclusion.},

The approach harnesses data-driven insights derived from student performance, behavior, and engagement to provide a personalized educational experience tailored to each student’s requirements. The integration of big data analytics and machine learning (ML) in education presents significant potential to transform traditional teaching methodologies. Data is collected from open sources, including engagement scores, assessment results, forum participation, attendance, and study hours. Preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values to ensure data reliability. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) text mining technique is utilized to extract features from student-generated content, highlighting essential phrases. TF-IDF enables the identification of critical learning themes and areas requiring additional support. A hybrid method, namely, the snow leopard optimized-tuned intelligent CatBoost (SLO-ICatBoost), is deployed for predicting student grades, assessing performance, and enhancing the educational process. The SLO improves the selection of relevant features, while the ICatBoost algorithm classifies students based on their performance patterns and learning behaviors. When compared to conventional teaching techniques, the proposed SLO-ICatBoost method significantly improves precision (0.990), accuracy (0.991), F1-score (0.990), and recall (0.991).

  abstract = {Objectives
            Several stakeholders are formally recognised when designing undergraduate medical curricula, but past studies have failed to identify them with sufficient breadth, to explore their understanding of the system, or examine their views on curriculum composition. This qualitative study drew on elements of systems thinking to better understand the stakeholders in undergraduate medical education and their role and priorities in curriculum composition.
          
          
            Methods
            This study employed an exploratory qualitative methodology. Participants were initially identified from the General Medical Council's list of stakeholders and were recruited using a combination of convenience, judgmental and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semistructured interviewing. Interviews were descriptively coded and then thematically analysed.
          
          
            Results
            In total, 18 participants were interviewed about their perspectives on stakeholders, the purpose of the education, along with their ideal weightings for curriculum subjects. The findings suggested that the breadth of stakeholders exceeded the modest list provided by the General Medical Council. The purposes of the education were themed into: (1) safe patient care, (2) social benefit, (3) service provision, (4) student benefit and (5) provider benefit. Safe patient care emerged as a universally shared purpose, although views on the customer varied between participants. Curricula priorities were more diverse, with competing interests favouring different subjects for emphasis in the curriculum, with views on the value of scientific-learning particularly divided.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Undergraduate medical education likely concerns a broader range of stakeholders than are often engaged. Several stakeholders are formally recognised when designing undergraduate medical curricula but past studies have failed to identify them with sufficient breadth, to explore their understanding of the system, or to examine their views on curriculum composition. This research raised questions about engagement of vital stakeholders and how power is distributed in the system, along with the need to develop roles into the future when renewing curricula.},

  abstract = {The Flying Bluebottle Illusion is a compelling example of how the perceived trajectory of moving objects can be greatly influenced by other motion sources in the visual scene. In this article, we present a series of simplified variants of the Flying Bluebottle Illusion in which the true motion of a target is a circular orbit around a central point. However, when a similar but offset orbiting motion trajectory is added to a set of surrounding inducers, the perceived trajectory of the target is drastically altered in both extent and direction. In other words, the perceived orbiting motion of the target is “pulled” and distorted by the orbiting motion of the inducers. For simplicity's sake, we refer to the illusory effect revealed by these dueling orbits as the Dueling Orbit Illusion. These simplified variants lend themselves to empirical study with resultant effects that can be readily modeled. Here, we present a series of case examples for how the parameters of the stimuli may be varied to yield predictable effects, describe a straightforward computational model for quantifying the magnitude of the contextual influence, and discuss how the model may be leveraged to gain insight into the phenomenon of induced motion across a range of within and between observer domains.},

            Methods
            
              Jatropha podagrica
              leaves, stems, and roots were extracted using 70% ethanol. The extract was then fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Antibacterial assays, including agar well diffusion and MIC - MBC determination, were carried out. Bioactive compounds were docked with bacterial target proteins using AutoDock Vina. Binding interactions were analyzed. SwissADME, ProTox-3.0, and STopTox were used to assess the drug-likeness and toxicity of selected compounds. Data were expressed as mean ± SD using Microsoft Excel 2010.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              Extracts of
              J. podagrica
              roots and stems exhibited antibacterial activities against the selected pathogens, with the ethyl acetate fraction showing the highest potential. The extracts had higher effectiveness towards Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. Further experiments demonstrated that the ethyl acetate fraction extract of
              J. podagrica
              roots identified bactericidal effects against selected pathogens, while the n-hexane fraction extract exhibited bacteriostatic effects against these pathogens based on MIC-MBC ratio. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the compound jatrophone had adequate binding affinity to ADP and higher binding affinity to PBP1a and PBP5 compared to the standard drug.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            
              These findings suggest that
              J. podagrica
              could be a potential source of antibacterial agents, warranting further investigation for therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Numerical heat transfer models are increasingly used to compute the temperature field, melt pool dimensions and thermal cycles for laser powder bed fusion but huge computational demand of these models is a perpetual challenge. We present a recently introduced novel dynamic meshing strategy to preserve a fine meshed region always beneath the laser beam and a gradually coarsened region away from the beam thereby notably reducing the overall model size and computational demand. Probed over a wide range of conditions, we show a reduction of the computational time and volume by nearly 6 to 10 times vis-à-vis little loss of accuracy in the computed results with the dynamic meshing strategy compared to traditional approaches with static uniform meshing.},

  abstract = {Flatfoot is a very common condition that alters gait mechanics and is usually accompanied by pain. In this current study, two types of custom-made insoles using polyethylene and silicon, respectively, were designed to help alleviate this condition. Such insoles are tested for their functionality using advanced 3D printing and finite element analysis. Tests were conducted at body weights of 60, 80, 100, and 120 kg. Results indicated that silicone insoles outperformed the others by effecting a better redistribution of pressure with higher magnitudes of strain and stress. Specifically, silicon had strain values between 1.44 × 10
            −7
            and 2.88 × 10
            −7

            –1.18 × 10
            −4
            . Whereby, silicon would withstand stress levels to about 47,058 Pa, while polyethylene would do so at 31,932 Pa, making it more resilient under higher loads. Further validation through kinematic analysis proved that silicon insoles enhance the symmetry of walk and disperses the concentration of pressures of the feet, therefore providing more comfort and support during locomotion. These results suggest that silicon insoles offer significant benefits for managing flatfoot, paving the way for future innovations in personalized orthopedic footwear.},

  abstract = {Creative writing instruction plays a crucial role in developing students’ linguistic and cognitive abilities. However, challenges such as lack of engagement, difficulty in idea generation, and limited stylistic diversity hinder students from fully expressing their thoughts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution to enhance writing quality and creativity. This study aims to develop an AI-assisted creative writing framework by integrating GPT-4 with Innovative Locust Swarm Optimization (ILSO) to generate more engaging, coherent, and stylistically rich text tailored to students’ writing levels. A dataset of student-written essays, novels, and poetry was collected for training. Pre-processing techniques, including text normalization and tokenization, were applied to refine the input text. Feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec embedding to enhance semantic understanding. GPT-4 generates adaptive text suggestions, while ILSO optimizes model hyperparameters to refine text coherence, creativity, and narrative flow. The optimized model adapts to individual writing styles, offering dynamic suggestions that encourage creativity while maintaining fluency. The ILSO algorithm fine-tunes the generation process by enhancing text structuring and thematic consistency. The proposed method was implemented using Python 3.10.1. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized GPT model significantly improves coherence scores, stylistic variation, thematic consistency, writing proficiency, and engagement rates. However, concerns regarding AI dependency and originality necessitate a balanced integration of AI-assisted and traditional writing pedagogy. This study provides a foundation for future adaptive AI-driven creative writing instruction, with potential extensions including real-time feedback systems and self-learning mechanisms for personalized writing enhancement.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effect of gamification on visual programming and computational thinking skills among primary school students, aiming to investigate how gamified learning environments enhance cognitive skill development and conceptual integration compared to traditional teaching methods. A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 346 fifth-grade students from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group utilized gamified tools, such as ClassDojo and Wordwall, while the control group employed traditional teaching methods. Data collection included achievement tests, observational measures, and assessments of computational thinking. The author used Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) with the “qgraph” package in R to estimate the network structures. Initial visual programming skills showed no significant differences between groups. However, post-test results revealed substantial improvements in both visual programming and computational thinking for the experimental group. The gamified learning environment effectively enhanced these skills through increased motivation and active engagement. These findings support the use of gamification in primary education to enhance critical 21st-century skills. However, the study’s geographic and grade-level specificity limits generalizability, and long-term skill retention was not assessed. Future research should expand to diverse demographics, incorporate longitudinal designs, and explore integration with emerging technologies (e.g., adaptive learning platforms).},

However, several critical limitations affect the deployment of these technologies, including privacy concerns and the need for advanced predictions about student behavior alongside adaptations to standard educational frameworks. This investigation examines the role of LA in ELT, focusing on how data-driven strategies powered by artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning (DL), can enhance student engagement and academic success. The dataset, sourced from a publicly available Kaggle repository, comprises anonymized real-world student interaction metrics, including demographics, engagement patterns, interactions with the learning system, and academic performance. To efficiently preprocess the dataset, numerical features are normalized using Z-score normalization, and features are extracted using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which assigns weights to each term based on its frequency in a document and rarity across the dataset. DL models, including the weighted white shark optimized deep residual network (WWSO-DResNet), were employed to examine student engagement patterns, predict learning outcomes, and provide personalized learning paths. The findings indicate that students who received personalized learning interventions based on WWSO-DResNet insights performed significantly better in terms of engagement and academic achievement. The performance of the proposed WWSO-DResNet approach was evaluated using metrics such as MAE (0.09), RMSE (0.21), MSE (0.18), and MAPE (0.25). The WWSO-DResNet method proved effective in identifying at-risk students early, enabling preventive interventions. In conclusion, AI-powered LA holds promise for transforming ELT by fostering personalized learning experiences.},

Data preprocessing included text cleaning and tokenization applied to the acquired data. Subsequently, feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec. The RR algorithm was utilized to optimize hyperparameters and feature selection, while BiLSTM ensures a deep understanding of contextual relationships in conversations, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency in processing financial queries. Furthermore, a dynamic training mechanism was integrated, allowing the chatbot to continually adapt to increasing consumer demands without downtime. The proposed method was implemented using Python software, and its performance was compared with traditional algorithms. The overall metrics—F1-score (87.75%), precision (89.25%), recall (86.24%), and accuracy (90%)—illustrate that the suggested model significantly improves customer engagement, reduces the workload of accountants, and enhances the overall efficiency of accounting services by providing reliable financial support.},

  abstract = {Mongolian folk painting images have long served as a symbol of the richness of their cultural legacy. These images represent a profound cultural demonstration of the nomadic lifestyle and spiritual beliefs of the Mongolian people. This study presents a predictive framework that uses CNN-based VGG16 model as an image recognition technology to identify Mongolian folk art. The proposed framework consists of multiple parts, such as image source engines for automated data collecting, image classes for Mongolian and Indian traditional paintings, dataset creation, and manual image visualization to guarantee the quality of the datasets. Stability of the dataset is improved by preprocessing methods like pixel value normalization and overfitting minimization. With its deep convolutional neural network architecture, the CNN-based VGG16 model is used for image recognition and shows skill in recognizing intricate visual patterns. The proposed framework is distinguished by a methodical algorithmic flow that includes dataset creation, model training, iterative refinement, and data retrieval. Test accuracy (77.97%) and test loss (0.6828) demonstrate how well the model recognizes Mongolian folk paintings. Extensive results that include feature extraction, ROC and PR curves, and confusion matrix analysis highlight how well the framework achieves a balanced precision-recall trade-off. This study contributes a useful methodology to the growing field of cultural image recognition, highlighting the integration of traditional art with advanced technology.},

  abstract = {The study addresses limitations of the 4-Component Thinking Styles Questionnaire (4-CTSQ) measuring actively open-minded thinking (AOT), close-minded thinking (CMT), preference for effortful thinking (PET), and preference for intuitive thinking (PIT). The aim was to validate the 4-CTSQ in a non-U.S./Canadian population, to explore the nomological networks of thinking styles, and to test whether the 4-CTSQ predicts unfounded beliefs over and beyond analytic thinking. The secondary aim was to address the issue of acquiescence linked with the one-directional wording of the items and to develop a balanced version of the 4-CTSQ (4-CTSQ-B). In two studies (
            N
            1 = 1,233,

Conceptual and psychometric issues with AOT and CMT were identified and possible solutions were discussed. The 4-CTSQ, and somewhat more so the 4-CTSQ-B, appear to be good scales sensitive to distinct thinking styles.},

  abstract = {To enhance the operational reliability of wireless power supply systems for transmission line monitoring devices and to facilitate bidirectional communication between the power transmitter and receiver, this study proposes a simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) scheme employing a multi-relay coil configuration. By exploiting the multi-resonant behavior inherent in high-order compensation topologies—specifically LCC and LCL structures—the proposed system realizes efficient co-transmission of energy and information. A comprehensive power transmission model, alongside an equivalent circuit model for data communication, is developed to capture the electromagnetic coupling and transmission dynamics within the multi-relay environment. The characteristics of both power and data channels are analytically examined, and the validity of the proposed methodology is substantiated through simulation studies. The results confirm that the system achieves robust power delivery while maintaining reliable data transmission, thereby offering a promising solution for deployment in high-voltage insulator string scenarios.},

However, limited by the problems of insufficient data and class imbalance in the monitoring of tunnel defects, the model may face the prediction bias during the training process. Therefore, this study introduces a tunnel health assessment method based on data augmentation to improve the classification performance and generalization ability of the model. First, the defects monitoring data of the left line of the Huilongshan Tunnel in Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province were collected, a true dataset containing 13 defect indicators was established, and preprocessing operations such as feature transformation, outlier detection and handling, missing value filling, and normalization were performed on it.

  abstract = {To address the challenges of poor adaptability to multi-scale features and high-dimensional redundancy in painting style classification, this study proposes an improved classification method by integrating the Xception network with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The Xception model extracts both fine-grained details and global semantic information, while PCA selects the most discriminative principal components to reduce redundant features, enhancing classification accuracy and efficiency. Experiments conducted on Eastern and Western painting datasets with 10-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including EfficientNet, RegNet, and ConvNeXT. Notably, it achieves an average classification accuracy of 0.973 in Western painting classification. Moreover, the integration of PCA significantly reduces computation time, with classification speeds of 105 ms for Eastern paintings and 100 ms for Western paintings, surpassing benchmark models. This study presents an efficient and precise solution for automated art style classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction.

Current evaluation methods are predominantly subjective, lacking the ability to objectively and comprehensively capture and quantify these dynamic attributes. To address this limitation, this study proposes an innovative approach for evaluating artistic creativity by integrating an artificial immune algorithm (AIA). Initially, features related to color, shape, and texture are extracted from the artworks, and these feature vectors are input into the AIA as antigens. Subsequently, by defining antigen-antibody matching rules, the features of the artworks are compared with creative reference antibodies generated by the algorithm to derive creativity evaluation results. Finally, leveraging a dynamic adjustment mechanism for bidirectional crossover mutation probabilities, the diversity of the antibody population is optimized through a clonal selection strategy, enhancing the model’s adaptability to diverse artistic styles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved AIA achieves significant enhancements in evaluation metrics, with average Precision and Recall values increasing by 8.45% and 11.21%, respectively, compared to the baseline AIA. This study concludes that the AIA-integrated creativity evaluation method effectively improves the objectivity and accuracy of artistic assessments, offering a novel perspective for the intelligent evaluation of artworks.},

To address this challenge, this study employs image analysis technology based on the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once v4) object detection algorithm to enhance the visual effectiveness of advertisement design. First, a diverse set of advertisement samples is collected, and image augmentation techniques are applied to expand the dataset. The YOLOv4 model is then trained using the CSPDarknet53 (Cross-Stage Partial Darknet53) network for feature extraction, integrating multi-scale prediction to improve detection accuracy. The trained model is subsequently utilized to identify and analyze visual elements within advertisements, assessing their spatial distribution and layout characteristics. Based on these insights, an automated optimization framework is developed to refine design elements such as color, size, and layout proportions, with the results visualized for comparative analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a detection precision of 98.1% and a recall rate of 96.8% for product elements. The optimized print advertisements exhibit a focus concentration of 0.84 and an element distribution density of 0.87, significantly enhancing design clarity and effectiveness.

  abstract = {Efficiently managing sports schedules in collegiate environments is a challenging and crucial task. With multiple teams, events, facilities, and diverse stakeholder needs, traditional scheduling methods often fail to meet the dynamic and complex requirements of modern sports programs. Complex scheduling algorithms offer a promising solution by optimizing the allocation of resources, time slots, and facilities while minimizing conflicts and maximizing participation. The research analyzes the impact of complex scheduling algorithms on injury rates and athletic performance in a collegiate sports environment, with a particular focus on ACL injuries in basketball players. The research gathers the history, performance, and demographic data from athletes. The data was preprocessed using cleansing and normalizing the data, and handling missing values. The research employs an ICO-MLPN to predict injury risk and improve athletic performance in collegiate sports environments. The research explores the application of the DLB scheduling algorithm to create tailored schedules that account for individual requirements, training intensity, and recovery periods to reduce the risk of ACL. The findings suggest that the complex scheduling algorithms improve athletic performance and also significantly reduce the incidence of ACL injuries, offering an ICO-MLPN framework for collegiate basketball programs to improve performance with a recall of 95.33%, accuracy of 98.70%, precision of 98.2%, and F1-score of 96.20%. After implementing DLB, the injury risk incident rate decreased from 50% to 30%, treatment costs decreased from 50% to 20%, physical health satisfaction improved from 65% to 85%, and mental health satisfaction increased from 60% to 80%. Recovery time decreased from 2.5 days to 2 days, and minimum severity injuries increased from 50% to 65%.

  abstract = {In traditional environmental art design, it is often challenging to comprehensively account for a multitude of complex factors, and the optimization process tends to be computationally intensive and intricate. Key aspects such as illumination, shadow, and sightlines between landscape elements are frequently overlooked, leading to incoherent layout schemes in practical applications. This study addresses these limitations by employing genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize the layout of landscape elements, thereby automating the generation of optimal layout schemes. Initially, an objective function is established to evaluate layout schemes by holistically considering landscape aesthetics, functionality, ecological benefits, and feasibility, with each factor’s contribution quantified. The layout scheme is encoded into real-valued representations, where each individual denotes the location, size, and other attributes of landscape elements. An initial population is generated to ensure diversity and adherence to basic constraints. Each generation of individuals is assessed using a fitness function that integrates multiple sub-goals, evaluating the merits of each layout scheme through weighted summation. The tournament selection method is employed to choose individuals with higher fitness in each generation for crossover and mutation operations, thereby generating new layout schemes. Through iterative optimization over multiple generations, the genetic algorithm refines the layout scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the overall space utilization rate exceeds 0.7, and the weighted scores of the landscape layout schemes range between 8.075 and 8.59. This approach offers a novel solution for environmental art design, significantly enhancing the coherence and practicality of layout schemes.},

  abstract = {Background:
            Sagittal-plane slope-reducing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) can reduce the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in knees with a high posterior tibial slope. The biomechanical effect of slope-reducing HTO on tibiofemoral kinematics and force carried by the ACL remains less well understood.
          
          
            Hypothesis:
            Decreased tibial slope will be associated with decreased ACL force, coupled internal tibial rotation (ITR), and anterior tibial translation (ATT) under both compressive and combined compressive and valgus loads.
          
          
            Study Design:
            Descriptive laboratory study.
          
          
            Methods:
            Computational models of 10 cadaveric knees were created using magnetic resonance imaging– and computed tomography–based 3-dimensional renderings of the bones, articular cartilage, and menisci. Virtual slope-reducing HTO was performed on each tibial geometry in 1° increments, creating tibial slopes spanning −5° to 15°. All knees were flexed to 15°, and loads consisting of (1) axial compression (100 N) and (2) combined axial compression (100 N) and valgus torque (8 N·m) were then applied to each knee at each tibial slope. The outcome measures were ACL force, coupled ITR, and ATT. Relationships between tibial slope and each outcome measure were assessed via linear regression (α = .05), and the effects of 10° slope-reducing HTO, from 15° to 5°, on each outcome measure were reported.
          
          
            Results:
            
              A 10° slope-reducing HTO decreased ACL force by 53% under compression (1.7 N of ACL force per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001) and 47% under combined compression and valgus (4.7 N of ACL force per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001). Regarding kinematics, a 10° slope-reducing HTO decreased coupled ITR by 64% under combined compression and valgus (0.99° of coupled ITR per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001). Finally, a 10° slope-reducing HTO decreased ATT by 54% under compression (0.14 mm of ATT per degree decrease in tibial slope;
              P
              &lt; .001).
            
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Slope-reducing HTO decreased ACL force linearly by reducing ATT with compression and also by decreasing coupled ITR with combined compression and valgus.
          
          
            Clinical Relevance:
            Slope-reducing HTO decreased ATT and coupled ITR, dampening movements known to load the ACL. These findings may provide a further biomechanical basis for the ability of slope-reducing HTO to decrease the risk of ACL injury.},

This resilience to instrumentation-level uncertainties substantiates the model’s operational reliability in practical concrete testing environments.

  abstract = {This article explores the relationship between race, technology, music, and geographical thought through the vehicle of jazz musician Sun Ra’s piece ‘Space Is the Place’ considered in formal, historical, and critical context. Specifically, the author engages with Katherine McKittrick’s concept of transparent space to argue that ‘Space Is the Place’, in a tradition reaching from Ra’s avant-garde popular music back through a rich tradition of Black American musical practice, deploys time signature in a way that upsets traditional concepts of grounds or grounding embedded at the foundation of Western thought. Taking seriously Ra’s conviction that his music literally, and not merely figuratively, transports listeners to a new planet, this article speculatively suggests that the form of thought generated by the music’s disruption of grounds/grounding is uniquely suitable for addressing the radical social, economic, and political shifts currently occurring in humanity’s rapidly intensifying flight from the grounds of the Earth. The compression of these vast social forces into the sensuous experience of ‘Space Is the Place’ thus transports the listener by altering fundamental processes of spatiotemporal relationality that echo into conscious thought. This article demonstrates the interconnectedness of musical expression with geographical imaginaries and suggests a new kind of thinking with which to approach geographical analyses beyond the geocentric, capable of answering the demands of the cosmos.},

  abstract = {Aiming at industrial loads with high flexibility, such as material conveying processes, an active potential mining method for day-ahead invitation demand response is studied through optimization. Under the day-ahead invitation demand response mechanism, an aggregation method for industrial conveying loads and an active potential mining framework for load aggregators participating in demand response are proposed. The demand response potential mining of the conveying load aggregators is formulated as optimization problems. Through the constructions of publishment functions attaching to demand response period, a potential mining model for day-ahead invitation demand response and an integrated potential mining model capable to response to day-ahead invitation demand and time-of-use tariff simultaneously are built, respectively. A cement clinker conveying system is taken as the study case to verify the demand response active potential mining models under multi-operating conditions. The results show that the proposed active potential mining models can actively participate in day-ahead invitation demand response and obtain the maximum potential, meanwhile, satisfy all the production requirements and safety constraints. The models can be references for highly flexible industrial loads to participate in demand response.},

  abstract = {Existing LSTM-based power quality (PQ) prediction models primarily rely on historical information, which limits their ability to fully capture contextual dependencies. Furthermore, these models process inputs sequentially without accounting for the varying importance of different time steps, leading to significant prediction inaccuracies. To address these limitations, this study proposes an enhanced PQ prediction model that integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism. The BiLSTM module is introduced to model both forward and backward temporal dependencies, enabling a more comprehensive capture of long-term patterns in time series data. The SA mechanism dynamically adjusts the importance of different time steps through weighted summation, enhancing the model’s ability to focus on critical features and improving its capacity to model nonlinear relationships. The weighted features from the SA layer are then mapped to a fully connected layer to generate the final prediction outputs. Experiments were conducted using power quality data from Nanchang as the primary dataset, with additional datasets from Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, and Beijing used for generalization testing. The results demonstrate that the BiLSTM-SA model outperforms traditional LSTM models across all PQ metrics, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.09 for voltage deviation, a 0.05 improvement over single-layer LSTM. Notably, the model maintains robust performance in complex power supply scenarios, with a generalized MAE of only 0.2 in Beijing. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining BiLSTM with the SA mechanism in reducing prediction errors and ensuring the stability of power supply quality, offering a significant advancement in PQ prediction methodologies.},

We formulate crime count prediction as a spatiotemporal sequence challenge, where both input data and prediction targets are spatiotemporal sequences. In order to improve the accuracy of crime forecasting, we introduce a new model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We conducted a comparative analysis to access the effects of various data sequences, including raw and binned data, on the prediction errors of four deep learning forecasting models. Directly inputting raw crime data into the forecasting model causes high prediction errors, making the model unsuitable for real-world use. The findings indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves optimal performance when crime data is categorized into 10 or 5 groups. Data binning can enhance forecasting model performance, but poorly defined intervals may reduce map granularity. Compared to dividing into five bins, binning into 10 intervals strikes an optimal balance, preserving data characteristics and surpassing raw data in predictive modeling efficacy.},

This study proposes an innovative methodological framework that synergistically integrates the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm with advanced topic modeling techniques, thereby offering transformative potential for the analysis and governance of online public discourse. The methodology involves a sophisticated multi-stage analytical process: First, textual data undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being transformed into a term frequency matrix using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, establishing a robust quantitative foundation for subsequent analysis. The LDA algorithm is then systematically applied to extract latent thematic structures from the dataset, while an original hierarchical optimization strategy substantially enhances the model’s dynamic topic identification and tracking capabilities. Furthermore, the integration of a sentiment lexicon with the extracted topics enables precise opinion classification, permitting real-time monitoring of topic evolution through quantitative heat fluctuation metrics. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to conventional LDA, achieving a 12.7% reduction in the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for tracking topic heat dynamics. This methodological breakthrough not only advances the theoretical foundations of public opinion analysis but also provides a scientifically rigorous, dynamic monitoring framework with significant practical implications for evidence-based governance and policy formulation in the digital era.},

  abstract = {In the field of underground engineering, the construction model of two-dimensional design and decentralized management is no longer able to enhance the efficiency trend of multi-party collaboration and information management, nor can it meet the future demand for refined management and sustainable development of engineering construction. Therefore, this paper first summarizes and analyses the current development status of collaborative design platforms at home and abroad, and proposes a “cloud + terminal” overall technical architecture suitable for underground engineering collaborative design management. This architecture consists of a foundation layer, data layer, service layer, functional application layer, and user interaction layer. The functional modules of the platform also adopt microservice architecture design. In response to the shortcomings of model checking, an IFC component of the model checking module was designed based on an optimized multi view convolutional neural network algorithm to correct errors in the lowest level category information data. At the same time, technical routes were proposed around “three zone independence” and “problem positioning.” Developed a prototype platform with basic functions and applied it to the design process of a certain engineering project. By comparing with traditional design patterns, the results show that the collaborative platform proposed in this paper effectively improves work efficiency and achievement quality. Next, we will continue to expand the functions and application scenarios of the collaborative platform, providing strong support for improving the construction quality and efficiency of underground engineering throughout its entire life cycle.},

Post rigorous signal filtering and statistical analyses, the thorax and lumbar spine sensors emerged as the most accurate for the upper and lower body, respectively. However, regions like the cerebral and legs faced compromised signals due to external interferences such as body movements.

Using a qualitative descriptive design, aligned with a constructivist paradigm, focus groups were conducted with 3 autistic adults and 12 caregivers of autistic children.

Five themes were generated accounting for early sensory experiences in autism: (1) Acknowledging the uniqueness of sensory preferences, (2) Negative impacts of different sensory experiences, (3) Feeling different and the pursuit of belonging, (4) Controlling sensory experiences to support daily function, and finally (5) Overcoming the challenges of the sensory world.

            Sensory behaviours in early childhood can impact how autistic children experience and engage in the world. There is a lot of research about sensory differences in autistic children; however, there is very little known about experiences in early childhood. We asked 3 autistic adults and 12 caregivers of autistic children about their/their child’s experiences of sensory behaviours in early childhood. In our sample, autistic adults and caregivers of autistic children shared similar experiences about the challenges they/their children face related to sensory experiences in early childhood and how they overcame these.

  abstract = {Foreign trade talents play a crucial role in China’s foreign trade business. It’s no doubt that the high-quality foreign trade talent will step on the new step for our country foreign trade to provide more powerful support. This paper, based on the perspective of New Liberal Arts, initially constructs a framework for the competency model of new foreign trade talents. This model underwent expert consultation using the Delphi method. Subsequently, the competency model was further refined based on the Onion Model, resulting in a new foreign trade talent competency model comprising three characteristics—knowledge, ability, and literacy—and 16 indicators. On this basis, considering the current limitations in foreign trade talent training, this paper proposes effective ways to cultivate new foreign trade talents’ competencies from the perspective of New Liberal Arts’ construction and reform.},

  abstract = {Since digital media have changed the way information is disseminated and even social interaction behavior, the issue of affective value throughout the history of human development has created a divide between constructivist and universalist research. In this process, the focus of affective research has begun to shift towards redefining its connotations and uncovering the productive factors through which its value is expressed. To visually present the research frontiers and hotspots, and classify and analyze the data, various knowledge graphs were drawn using CiteSpace visualization analysis tool. Web of Science was selected as the data source, and K-means algorithm was used for clustering analysis to identify different topics and hotspots in the research field. This study found that affective value in the age of digital media shows a triple bias of social interaction, media memory and neurocognition. When individual affect spread through social media platforms like TikTok, it can escalate quickly, leading to a cascade of significant social events. This has spurred important research avenues into affective value such as organizational dynamics, media functions, and neuroscience. Thus, this paper argues that the tension between affective value and the application of affective value in the governance of digital media space is the main direction to solve the affective conflict or affective cooperation in the current society. This study integrates theories such as evolution theory, social constructivism, and psychoanalysis, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of emotional values and also having important guiding significance for the design and operation of digital media platforms.},

  abstract = {To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of path planning in smart elderly care services, this paper proposes a hybrid path optimization model integrating Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Traditional approaches struggle with dynamic environmental adaptation and multi-objective optimization, often leading to suboptimal routing. To address this, the proposed model employs DQN to establish an autonomous decision-making framework, leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize path selection based on environmental variations and reward mechanisms. Meanwhile, PSO enhances the global search capability, adjusting particle positions and velocities to mitigate the risk of local optima and improve overall path efficiency. A multi-objective optimization framework is further introduced, incorporating weighted coefficients to balance competing objectives and ensure comprehensive optimization. Additionally, a dynamic environmental adaptation mechanism enables real-time data updates, allowing the system to swiftly respond to sudden environmental changes and continuously refine path selection. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior performance, achieving an average path planning time of 52 seconds and a service response time of 17 s. The approach maintains high path accuracy, with a minimal distance deviation of 1.35%, and delivers an optimized objective function value of 0.84. These findings highlight the model’s effectiveness in real-time adaptive path planning, offering a robust and intelligent solution for elderly care mobility and service optimization.},

  abstract = {In the context of increasing environmental challenges and the demand for sustainable development, traditional resource scheduling models in business management often fail to balance economic efficiency with environmental constraints. To address this gap, this study proposes an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, termed OBLPSO, which integrates Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) and a perturbation mechanism. First, OBL generates a high-quality initial population to improve solution diversity, while a cosine curve adaptive strategy dynamically adjusts inertia weights to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Additionally, a perturbation mechanism expands the search range, preventing premature convergence. A multi-objective optimization model is established, incorporating task time, economic cost, and environmental impact (e.g., energy consumption and pollutant emissions) to maximize resource utilization and minimize ecological harm. Experimental results demonstrate that OBLPSO reduces task processing time by 29.7% and energy consumption by 16.1% compared to benchmark algorithms (e.g., ACO, GA, and standard PSO) under large-scale tasks (2000 tasks). The proposed method provides a robust solution for sustainable resource scheduling in an enterprise management environment with economic constraints.},

This study integrates the Transformer model, leveraging its self-attention mechanism and position encoding to incorporate global information at each time step. This approach enables the flexible modeling of long-range dependencies, resulting in more natural and harmonically coherent music sequences. First, serialized encoding is employed to transform musical events. A multi-scale attention mechanism is then introduced, applying different attention strategies at each layer to capture distinct musical elements across various time scales. Additionally, periodic position encoding is incorporated to enhance the recognition of recurrent musical patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art models such as MuseNet, MelodyRNN, and MusicTransformer, the proposed method reduces average perplexity by 5.4%, 11.7%, and 9.5% on one dataset and 5.9%, 12.1%, and 10.3% on another. These findings highlight the model’s superior capability in generating high-quality music with enhanced melodic consistency and diversity.

This study proposes a novel approach using the naive Bayes classifier (NBC) to integrate multi-dimensional data, including historical employment information, graduates' personal data, and macroeconomic indicators, to enhance the precision of employment trend predictions. A dataset comprising employment data from 810 graduates across three higher vocational colleges in a specific region, combined with macroeconomic indicators, was constructed. Data preprocessing techniques, such as missing value filling and feature standardization, were employed to ensure data quality. Feature selection was performed using univariate linear regression to eliminate irrelevant variables and retain highly correlated features. The NBC-based model, augmented with semi-supervised classification to expand the training dataset, demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average error rate of 2.76% in predicting employment across five workplaces and a 95.68% accuracy in salary level prediction. The model efficiently processed 10,000 student records in 35.28 milliseconds. These results validate the effectiveness of NBC in employment trend prediction and provide a robust foundation for optimizing innovative talent training strategies.},

Administering drugs at optimal times of the day may enhance effectiveness and reduce side effects. Certain cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to unexpected proarrhythmic effects such as fatal Torsade de Pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia. The Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) is a recent global initiative to create guidelines for the assessment of drug-induced arrhythmias that recommends a central role for computational modeling of ion channels and

            evaluation of compounds for TdP risk. We simulated circadian regulation of cardiac excitability and explored how dosing time of day affects TdP risk for 11 drugs previously classified into risk categories by CiPA. The model predicts that a high-risk drug taken at the most optimal time of day may actually be safer than a low-risk drug taken at the least optimal time of day. Based on these proof-of-concept results, we advocate for the incorporation of circadian clock modeling into the CiPA paradigm for assessing drug-induced TdP risk. Since cardiotoxicity is the leading cause of drug discontinuation, modeling cardiac-related chronopharmacology has significant potential to improve therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Bearing fault diagnosis is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of rotating machinery in industrial settings. Machine learning-based diagnostic models offer powerful solutions, but their effectiveness is challenged by substantial domain shifts caused by variations in operating conditions, such as changes in motor load. To address this challenge, a novel domain adaptation framework that combines physical domain knowledge with deep learning techniques is proposed. The framework employs envelope spectrum analysis to generate reliable pseudo-labels for unlabeled target domains. By incorporating local maximum mean discrepancy into the training process, the framework aligns feature distributions between source and target domains while preserving class-specific information. This method enhances the adaptability of diagnostic models to real-world industrial conditions, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and improving predictive reliability across different operating scenarios. Experimental results performed on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving superior classification accuracy under significant domain shifts. By improving fault detection under varying load conditions, this approach contributes to more efficient predictive maintenance, reducing unexpected failures and operational downtime in industrial machinery. This approach highlights the potential of combining physics-based insights with deep learning to enhance fault diagnosis in diverse and complex industrial scenarios.},

Through a case study of gender segregation in friendships, this study presents a workflow for developing a machine-learning-based gender conformity measure and applying it to guide the social network analysis of cultural matching. Results show that adolescents with similar gender conformity are more likely to form friendships, net of homophily based on categorical gender and other controls, and homophily by gender conformity mediates homophily by categorical gender.

            gene (LDS2). We used human specimens as well as a mouse model to further characterize enamel defects in LDS2 and to investigate the mechanism that leads to this phenotype. Deciduous teeth from patients with LDS2 exhibited normal enamel thickness, normal or localized reduction in enamel mineral density, impaired enamel ultrastructure, and impaired biomechanical properties, with some changes likely associated with environmental and systemic effects. Mice with mutation in the

            gene exhibited no significant changes in the amount of enamel produced or degree of mineralization. However, they presented with unique disruption of enamel rod decussation (crisscross pattern), resulting in impaired biomechanical properties. This phenotype is caused by impaired coordinated movement of ameloblasts (enamel-producing cells) during matrix deposition. Molecular analyses revealed that mutation in
            Tgfbr2
            in ameloblasts does not significantly affect pSMAD2/3 levels in vivo and has a minimal effect on gene expression in the enamel organ when compared with the aorta, in which hundreds of genes were differentially expressed and consistent with aortic aneurysm. However, we identified changes in the distribution and activation of the metastasis suppressor NDRG1, Rac1/Cdc42, and Myosin II that appear consistent with the disruption of ameloblast coordinated movement, although the exact mechanism through which mutation in

The results suggest that online CT awareness raising could be successful, if based on effective active learning principles, including good self-regulation, autonomy, willingness to offer peer-feedback and curiosity. We argue that CT capability is most effective through interdependence between learner confidence and curiosity.

  abstract = {The primary goal of sinonasal surgery is to improve a patient’s quality of life, which is generally achieved by enhancing drug delivery (eg, saline rinses, nasal steroids) and nasal airflow. Both drug delivery and nasal airflow are dependent on the anatomic structure of the sinonasal cavity and the relationship between this anatomy and airflow and drug delivery can be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD generally uses computed tomography scans and computational algorithms to predict airflow or drug delivery and can help us understand surgical outcomes and optimize drug delivery for patients. This study employs CFD to simulate nasal airflow dynamics and optimize drug delivery in the nasal cavity to highlight the utility of CFD for studying sinonasal disease. Utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software, we developed detailed models to analyze changes in airflow characteristics before and after functional endoscopic sinus surgery, focusing on pressure distribution, velocity profiles, streamline patterns, and heat transfer. This research examines the impact of varying levels of nasal airway obstruction on airflow and heat transfer. In addition, we explore the characteristics of nasal drug delivery by simulating diverse spray parameters, including particle size, spray angle, and velocity. Our comprehensive approach allows for the visualization of drug particle trajectories and deposition patterns, providing crucial insights for enhancing surgical outcomes and improving targeted drug administration. By integrating patient-specific nasal cavity models and considering factors such as airway outlet pressure, this study offers valuable data on pressure cross-sections, flow rate variations, and particle behavior within the nasal passages. The findings of this research can be useful for both surgical planning and the development of more effective nasal drug delivery methods, potentially leading to enhanced clinical outcomes in respiratory treatment.},

            Convolutional neural network (CNN) based volumetry of MRI data can help differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) as causes of cognitive decline and dementia. However, existing CNN-based MRI volumetry tools lack a structured hierarchical representation of brain anatomy, which would allow for aggregating regional pathological information and automated computational inference.
          
          
            Objective
            Develop a computational ontology pipeline for quantifying hierarchical pathological abnormalities and visualize summary charts for brain atrophy findings, aiding differential diagnosis.
          
          
            Methods
            Using FastSurfer, we segmented brain regions and measured volume and cortical thickness from MRI scans pooled across multiple cohorts (N = 3433; ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD), including healthy controls, prodromal and clinical AD cases, and bvFTD cases. Employing the Web Ontology Language (OWL), we built a semantic model encoding hierarchical anatomical information. Additionally, we created summary visualizations based on sunburst plots for visual inspection of the information stored in the ontology.
          
          
            Results
            Our computational framework dynamically estimated and aggregated regional pathological deviations across different levels of neuroanatomy abstraction. The disease similarity index derived from the volumetric and cortical thickness deviations achieved an AUC of 0.88 for separating AD and bvFTD, which was also reflected by distinct atrophy profile visualizations.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The proposed automated pipeline facilitates visual comparison of atrophy profiles across various disease types and stages. It provides a generalizable computational framework for summarizing pathologic findings, potentially enhancing the physicians’ ability to evaluate brain pathologies robustly and interpretably.},

However, to advance the field of computer-aided material reuse and support its integration into circular construction practices, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive overview of the available methods and their applications. We address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the literature on the role of computational design in facilitating the reuse of building elements, followed by analyzing the interrelationships between optimization methods, materials, and geometric dimensions of reclaimed materials. We then synthesize the identified approaches, offering guidelines that assist stakeholders in selecting suitable computational methodologies for integrating non-standard materials into design processes. Our findings highlight current knowledge gaps in algorithm scalability, performance integration, and the advancement of hybrid computational methods needed to unlock the full potential of computational design for a circular built environment.},

However, most existing human-computer collaborative programming learning is supported by traditional computers with a relatively low level of personalized interaction, which greatly limits the efficiency of students’ efficiency of programming learning and development of computational thinking. To address the above issues, this study introduces generative AI into human-computer collaborative programming learning and proposes a dialogue-negotiated human-computer collaborative programming learning method based on generative AI. The method focuses on the problems-solving process and constructs multiple agents through Prompt design, which enable students to improve their computational thinking and master programming skills in the process of human-computer interaction for problem-solving. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a 10th grade computer programming course in a high school. 43 students in the experimental group learned with the proposed method, while 42 students in the control group adopted the traditional computer-supported human-computer collaborative programming learning method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method more significantly improved students’ computational thinking, programming learning attitudes, and learning achievement. This study provides theoretical foundations and application reference for future generative AI-assisted human-computer collaborative teaching.},

  abstract = {Terms such as ‘public’, ‘public good’, ‘public value’ and ‘public domain’ occur frequently in policy documents. Without a sense of what ‘public’ means, however, not just in everyday language, but as a ‘thick concept’ that has acquired resonance over time, there can little point deploying the terms in policymaking. The dilemma is especially acute for those trying rethink the relationship between economics and its conventional hierarchy of concepts and culture as a public good (‘the foundations’). This includes both heterodox economic approaches and policymakers working pragmatically to add legitimacy to their terms, by expanding how they are classified and operate. This article examines the concept of ‘the public realm’ as found in Hannah Arendt’s
            The Human Condition
            (1958) and as it might be taken up by cultural policymaking today. The first section examines innovation economist Mariana Mazzucato’s arguments for revising the concept of ‘the common good’. The second section tackles the parts of
            The Human Condition
            dealing with ‘the public realm’ directly. The broad argument is that the histories, interdisciplinary existences and patterns of use of thick concepts are crucial to their meaning and sense as policymaking terms. I argue that Arendt’s ‘thinking thickly’ is instructive for those aiming to engage questions around the public value of culture and to repurpose state action in the cultural sector. The conclusion examines the UK Bennett Institute’s Working Paper, ‘Measurement of Social and Cultural Infrastructure’ (Bennett Institute for Public Policy, 2024) asking whether its use of key term is adequate to its policy object. What challenges do policymakers face now as they try to tack away from neoliberalism’s impasses but with no obvious alternative pathway on offer?},

This study investigated the impact of a Critical Thinking-based Tactical Training Program (TPCT) on specific technical skills—passing accuracy and ball control—in U-8 football players (mean age: 7.9 ± 0.7 years). A quasi-experimental design was employed with 32 participants (experimental group: n = 15, control group: n = 17). The experimental group underwent ten 60-min training sessions that combined tactical principles (width, penetration, mobility, space) with critical thinking exercises, while the control group followed traditional technical drills without tactical or cognitive components. The experimental group showed significant improvements in passing accuracy (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: W = 0.0, p = 0.002, effect size: −1.00) and ball control (paired t-test: t = 8.67, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.23). In contrast, the control group did not exhibit significant changes in either skill (p &gt; 0.05). These results suggest that integrating tactical principles and critical thinking exercises into training enhances technical skills in young players. The TPCT offers a promising approach for improving player development, providing both technical and cognitive benefits in grassroots football training.},

  abstract = {Against the background of accelerating global informatization, the media industry is undergoing profound changes. With the popularity of the Internet and social media, a considerable amount of information flocks to the public’s field of vision, which puts forward higher requirements for the timeliness, personalization, and creativity of media content. However, the traditional manpower-intensive content creation methods have made it challenging to meet the fast-paced needs of modern society. The fast-paced life of modern times has prompted people to pursue rapid access to and digestion of information. Traditional human-intensive content creation, such as writing, editing, and reviewing, can no longer keep up with this immediate demand. At the same time, audience segmentation requires media content to be accurately positioned, provide personalized services, and respond quickly to market changes. In today’s information explosion, maintaining high-quality content has become the core competitiveness of media, but it is difficult to balance timeliness and accuracy and depth of content in a manpower-intensive way. Therefore, in order to solve the existing problems, this study develops an intelligent content creation auxiliary system through natural language processing and reinforcement learning technology. Firstly, an NLP module is established to parse and generate high-quality text that conforms to grammatical rules and logical structure. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning mechanism is introduced to enable the system to have self-learning ability, and the strategy is constantly adjusted in multiple attempts to maximize the relevance and attractiveness indicators of the content. The system is applied to the natural environment of a prominent news website. Experiments show that within 3 months after the implementation of the system, compared with traditional hand-made manuscripts, the average click-through rate of the content created or recommended by it has increased by about 30%, and the user retention time has been extended by nearly 25%.},

  abstract = {Introduction:
            Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is utilized during cardiovascular surgery to maintain organ oxygen supply and blood perfusion instead of cardiopulmonary function. Three primary methods of artery cannulation used for CPB include ascending aortic cannulation (AscAoC), right axillary artery cannulation (rAxAC), and femoral artery cannulation (FAC).
          
          
            Methods:
            In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulation technology was employed to analyze aorta and main branches of 62 patients undergoing CPB with different arterial cannulation schemes, observing carotid artery (CarA) perfusion and characteristics.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Results indicate that the total perfusion of bilateral CarAs using the three cannulation methods was sufficient when there was no significant variation in arterial morphology. Without considering the peripheral resistance and the body’s autoregulatory function, the right CarA was less perfused than the left CarA under AscAoC and rAxAC, leading to perfusion imbalance. Especially heteroplastic patients with rAxAC may be at risk of the right CarA hypoperfusion during CPB. FAC provides balanced and adequate perfusion of both hemispheres without stenosis or dissection of the aorta.},

This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use. Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency. The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.},

This renewed attention requires careful engagement with contested archives, particularly when navigating racisms and biological essentialisms of the past that continue to haunt feminisms in the present. In this article, I ask what it means to inherit and care for the contested archive of the womyn's land movement and the potentialities it preserves for future feminist theorising while remaining committed to trans inclusion and antiracist and anticolonial praxis. Drawing from the papers of womyn's land culturemakers Ruth and Jean Mountaingrove, I argue for a more complex understanding of what it means to ‘inherit’ this work for feminists interested in lineages of land-based feminist thought. By more fulsomely accounting for the possibilities that emerge from non-biological and queer forms of intergenerational exchange at play on the land, I argue for the vitality of the ‘messiness’ of this archive as a source of its own feminist pedagogy, proposing a process of ‘thinking-with’ these archives as part of a web of engagements rather than a linear genealogy.},

  abstract = {This manuscript studies various process parameters like cutting velocity, feed rate, and cooling condition (dry, cryogenic, and emulsion) during drilling experiments performed on super-duplex stainless steel (SDSS) 2507 with coated and uncoated drill bits. The thrust force ranged from a minimum of 878.8 N (uncoated tool and emulsion cooling) to a maximum of 2500.1 N (uncoated tool and dry cooling), while torque values ranged from 19.87 to 2249.6 Nm under varying conditions. It was observed that thrust force and torque increased with higher feed rates and reduced with higher cutting velocities. Emulsion cooling consistently produced the lowest reactions, with an average reduction of 43% in thrust force compared to dry cooling, while dry drilling resulted in the highest forces and torques due to increased friction and heat. The use of a coated tool reduced the thrust force by up to 12% on average compared to uncoated tools under the same conditions. All three parameters studied (cutting velocity, feed rate and cooling condition) had statistically significant effects on thrust force (p ≤ 0.05), while torque was mainly influenced by feed rate and cooling condition, with a lesser effect from cutting velocity (p ≈ 0.06). The manuscript also presents the use of various computer-based modelling methods, including linear regression (R
            2
             = 0.9357 for thrust force), exponent-law relations (R
            2
             = 0.9854 for thrust force, 0.9375 for torque), artificial neural networks (mean error of 0.11% for thrust force, 0.3% for torque), and fuzzy-logic inference systems (R
            2
             = 0.9927 for thrust force, 0.9935 for torque), to model the outputs’ behaviour in relation to the input with remarkable precision.},

  abstract = {As the global energy crisis and environmental problems become increasingly severe, electric vehicles have become carrier transportation field due to their zero-emission and energy-saving characteristics. Large-scale popularization of electric vehicles has brought dual impacts, increase grid load fluctuations; on the other hand, through reasonable charging regulation and vehicle-network interaction, electric vehicles can be used as distributed energy storage resources to improve the efficiency and stability of power grid operation. However, at present, the research on the decision-making influencing factors of the interaction is still insufficient, and it is urgent to discuss its key driving factors and optimization paths in depth. Based on the actual data analysis, this paper makes an empirical study on the influencing factors of interactive decision-making between electric vehicles and power grid by using multiple regression model. The research results show that the charging behavior of electric vehicle owners is mainly affected by the fluctuation of electricity prices, charging convenience and renewable energy penetration rate. At the grid level, the increase in the proportion of distributed photovoltaic installed capacity has significantly increased the V2G participation rate. In addition, under different policy incentives, there are significant differences in the willingness of car owners to accept V2G: subsidy policies can increase the participation rate of car owners by 15%–20%. Based on this, this paper puts forward suggestions such as optimizing the charging pricing mechanism, improving the coverage of smart charging infrastructure, and promoting policy innovation related to vehicle-network interaction.},

  abstract = {Many communist regimes have presided over episodes of rapid industrial development, often coupled by the establishment of a planned economic system wherein the state replaces the market as the primary provider of essential resources and services. We argue that life experience under a communist-style industrial workplace fosters a distinct and enduring set of norms and habits that shape how citizens engage with political authorities. Leveraging exogenous variations created by China’s Third Front (TF) campaign, a massive industrial relocation project that moved large-scale industrial-administrative complexes into rural and interior areas between the 1960s–1970s, we show that residents from former TF areas today are more active in contacting the government about personal and community affairs, and hold stronger preferences for state-sponsored participation channels over more contentious ones. Additional analyses suggest that these behavioral patterns are less a strategic response to current local conditions than a result of early socialization. These findings highlight important subnational variations in national communist experiences and underscore the persistent influence of early communist institutions on citizen-government interactions in late communist societies.},

Compared with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)- and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based approaches on 1,300 U.S. gun violence news articles, this method addresses LDA’s limitations by focusing on high-level framing elements rather than keywords and is less labor-intensive than BERT-based supervised learning. Supporting both inductive and deductive analyses, it achieves comparable results to LDA while uncovering a previously unidentified gun violence frame.},

However, most studies of CT development in middle graders have focused on visual programming, lacking evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Python programming. Therefore, this study first developed 16 Python programming courses based on the CodeCombat programming platform. Then we conducted a 16-week Python programming course intervention study with 79 middle school students in seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in China to clarify the impact of Python programming on middle graders’ CT. The results revealed that Python programming intervention significantly improved CT for seventh, eighth, and ninth graders. The analysis of interaction effects for grade and gender showed that Python programming was most beneficial for eighth graders in CT improvement. Meanwhile, we found that the difference in CT caused by the gender factor varied according to grade level. Specifically, the gender factor caused significant CT differences in eighth and ninth graders, and girls were better performers than boys. These findings enrich the outcomes of Python programming and CT education in middle schools and provide implications for frontline programming educators to conduct Python interventions.},

They attended the iSTEM-DT lessons in the afternoon, for an hour daily, for about 4 weeks during the module implementation. Qualitative data such as fieldnotes, artefacts, photos and video recordings were collected from classroom observations. Data were also collected from teachers during reflection sessions after each lesson, while parents were interviewed at the end of the study. The data were analysed inductively through thematic analysis process. It was found that the iSTEM-DT module helped in developing preschoolers’ science process skills, namely observing, classifying, measuring, making inferences, predicting, and communicating skills, and some other higher order thinking skills.

Yet despite increasing calls for more general application of systems thinking in these fields of research, the paradigm remains poorly understood and systemic analysis is rare, particularly in qualitative research. This paper aims to address these issues. It starts by providing a primer to systems thinking clarifying what systems thinking is as a research philosophy, and describing core systemic principles such as complex causality and emergence. It then introduces the novel method of Inductive Systemic Analysis. Combining the methodology of grounded theory with the principles and key concepts of systems thinking, this method was specifically designed to make systemic analysis both relatable and accessible to a wide range of qualitative researchers. Utilising the case example the method was developed with, the paper works through each step of the research process. It explains preparing for systemic research through boundary considerations and developing a systemic research question; and goes on to describe the four-step analytical process of “zooming in” and “zooming out”, exploring the data in different ways. Ultimately, the method aims to support researchers in finding a balance between reflecting the complexity of social situations with ease of comprehension and applicability.},

Distinct from the unscented particle filter, HUPF implements the high-order unscented transform instead of the conventional second-order variant. Due to the superior accuracy of the HUKF over the standard UKF, HUPF not only selects particles more judiciously, enhancing particle utilization, but also more effectively manages the tail decay rate of the proposal distribution. This approach enables HUPF to closely approximate the optimal posterior probability under typical Gaussian conditions. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through a bearing-only tracking model example.},

In the present study, the epidemic patterns of SARS-COV-2 disease have been investigated from the point of view of mathematical modeling. Also, the effect of quarantine has been considered. This mathematical model is designed in the form of fractional calculations along with a model predictive control (MPC) to monitor this model. The fractional-order model has the memory and hereditary properties of the system, which can provide more adjustable parameters to the designer. Because the MPC can predict future outputs, it can overcome the conditions and events that occur in the future. The results of the simulations show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) of fractional-order has a lower mean squared error in susceptible people compared to the optimal control of fractional-order (~3.6e-04 vs. 47.4). This proposed NMPC of fractional-order can be used for other models of epidemics.},

  abstract = {Objective
            Cancer can have a profound impact on the life of the patient, presenting challenges such as dealing with complex healthcare models and psychological burden. Implementing design thinking (DT) in cancer care can improve the quality of life for patients. Although DT has been used in healthcare, there is limited research highlighting use of DT in cancer care. The objective of this review is to explore the applications of DT within a cancer care context.
          
          
            Methods
            We systematically searched databases (PubMed Central, Scopus, and Medline) for relevant papers published between January 2018 and March 2023. Articles were identified using keywords: 'cancer', 'cancer care', 'oncology', 'design thinking', and 'design science'. Studies meeting our inclusion criteria were included and data was collected on the focus of study (i.e., design thinking and cancer care), target condition, target intervention and objective of the study. Thematic analysis was performed to identify recurring themes across studies. Articles were evaluated by the lead author and cross verified by the other two authors to reduce the risk of bias.
          
          
            Results
            Twenty studies were included out of the 160 articles identified whereby 11 focus on cancer care (5 patient-facing, 5 community-facing, and 1 provider-facing studies) and 9 on design thinking (5 patient-facing, 1 community-facing, and 3 provider-facing studies). Overall, seven themes were identified with several subthemes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our findings indicate that design thinking has been successfully applied to improve patient experiences in cancer care. By involving various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and communities, design thinking helps better understand real world problems. However, there is a gap in design thinking research concerning the long-term evaluation and scalability of design thinking-based interventions. Additionally, our findings suggest that mixed methods approach for future studies would support to establish more empirical evidence in this domain.},

  abstract = {Background and objective:
            The Shape-Memory Alloy (SMA) or smart alloy stent can be used in the upper respiratory system by reducing problems such as changing the shape according to the actual conditions of the body compared to other stents.
          
          
            Methods:
            In this study, the behavior of 2 types of SMA stents with different metallurgical properties was studied using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Tracheal geometry was obtained from CT images of a healthy man. Then, a computational model of a real human trachea was selected to analyze the deformation of the trachea after implantation of the prosthesis. Finally, it was analyzed under the maximum average static pressure of the entrance to the trachea using the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) approach. A mesh based on unstructured elements for air and structured elements for the tracheal wall was created to perform simulations using ANSYS software.
          
          
            Results:
            The deformation of the stent was compared and analyzed with the deformation of the healthy trachea in the absence of the stent. The results presented that the most deformation in the trachea before stenting is up to 8.3 mm. The behavior of SMA2 with a deformation of 5.8 mm was more consistent with the deformation conditions of the trachea for real body conditions without the presence of a stent.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            As much as the deformation is reduced by the degree of stress concentration at the connection point of the stent to the trachea, the risks of stent displacement and patient suffocation are avoided.},

  abstract = {Aims and objectives:
            This paper attempts to develop a predictive computational model of Cantonese–English code-switching (CS) in Hong Kong, informed by language-internal and “language-external” (e.g., social) factors. I analyze this bilingual practice with respect to these factors and evaluate how accurately a model informed by this analysis can forecast Cantonese–English lexical choice in the context of digital platform WhatsApp.
          
          
            Approach:
            A quantitative “bag-of-words” approach was used to analyze bilingual variability/choice. The paper will focus on analyzing the frequency distribution of English and Cantonese choice at the word level without considering information in peripheral constituents (i.e., part-of-speech of the preceding and succeeding word, collocations).
          
          
            Data and analysis:
            A 329,087-word sociolinguistic corpus of WhatsApp messages from 24 Hong Kong residents was used. The data were analyzed using principal components analysis, sentiment analysis, and Bayesian multivariate regression.
          
          
            Findings:
            Part-of-speech, style, proficiency in English and Cantonese as well as attitudes toward switching to Cantonese interact with matrix language to condition CS. Switches from Cantonese to English signal “interpersonality” whereas the maintenance of English in English-matrix clauses index “informationality.” Individual factors have less of an impact than other factors, suggesting uniformity within the community. Attitudes toward mixing and preference for frequent mixing do not correlate with rates of CS.
          
          
            Originality:
            
              Unlike prior work, this paper analyzes original, manually collected WhatsApp data, typically underexplored due to access and privacy limitations, leveraging understudied variables such as style, sentiment (affect/emotion), attitudes, and linguistic factors and their interactions under a
              single
              model of digital CS. Furthermore, this paper considers the effect of individual/stylistic
              and
              dialectal/social factors on CS.
            
          
          
            Significance and implications:
            This paper advances research on Cantonese-English code-switching in Hong Kong and East Asia, enriching our understanding of bilingualism’s social, linguistic, and affective dimensions while informing multilingual AI models. By prioritizing a simple ‘bag-of-words’ approach to modeling, it also offers a computationally efficient method accessible to researchers with limited resources, broadening the methodological toolkit for sociolinguistic analysis.},

  abstract = {Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is now commonplace in myriad disciplines from sociology to psychology to environmental science and health and medicine. In the context of my home discipline, public health, CBPR is a collaborative research approach where participants and researchers co-design projects and move them to action to improve health outcomes. CBPR occurs on a lengthy continuum from minor (e.g., community advisory boards) to major (e.g., community PIs) community engagement. Despite numerous and growing examples and varied ways of defining and discussing CBPR, many self-identified CBPR researchers agree that participatory

  abstract = {Huntington’s disease (HD) is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. Early diagnosis and new therapeutic targets are essential for effective interventions. We performed integrative analyses of mRNA profiles from three microarrays and one RNA-seq dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The datasets included were GSE8762, GSE24250, GSE45516, and GSE64810. Data pre-processing included background correction, normalization, log2 transformation, probe-to-gene symbol mapping, and differential expression analysis. We identified 80 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a significance threshold (
                    p
                    &lt; 0.05) and absolute log fold change (logFC) &gt;0.65. Additionally, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of the identified genes. Protein-protein interactions among DEGs revealed a network from which seven hub genes (
                    VIM, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL1A2, DCN, CXCR2,
                    and

                    PITX1
                    (up-regulated), also hold potential as therapeutic targets. Insofar as biological contextualization of the findings is concerned, the top enriched GO terms were skeletal system development, blood vessel development, and vasculature development. Molecular function terms highlighted signaling receptor binding, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and platelet-derived growth factor binding. Notably, the significant KEGG pathways included amoebiasis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and the relaxin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present computational biology integrative analyses of multiple datasets discovered new DEGs and seven hub genes, shedding light on molecular mechanisms of HD. These findings call for translational clinical omics research and may potentially lead to future precision medicine interventions and novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {The sustainability of social development can be signified by the level of coordinated development of regional education–economy–human capital complex system (REEHCCS). However, the existing studies on the coordinated development of systems fail to consider the influence of human capital on specific systems, or identify the root causes of the complex state of the coordinated development. To solve the problem, this paper explores the modeling and simulation for the coordinated development of REEHCCS. Specifically, the REEHCCS structure was modeled, and reasonable evaluation indices were selected for coordination. Then, an REEHCCS coordination model was constructed, and the classification principles were detailed for the coordinated development of complex systems. On this basis, education and human capital were introduced to the dynamic Haavelmo model to identify the state and analyze the evolution of the REEHCCS. Finally, the proposed model was proved effective through simulation and case analysis. This study explores the complex interactions between regional education, economy, and human capital, and assesses their coordinated development through the construction of a coordination model and simulation experiments. The research findings indicate that the constructed model can effectively identify and analyze the coordinated development state and evolution trends of the regional education–economy–human capital system.},

  abstract = {Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes, period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if researchers observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can researchers reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in the understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.},

  abstract = {Introduction
            Diabetes is a major global health issue, requiring nursing interns to develop essential diabetes management skills. Traditional teaching methods are limited by clinical settings, hindering the development of comprehensive theoretical and clinical competencies. This study developed a Virtual Simulative Diabetes Care Program to address these limitations.
          
          
            Methods
            
              A quasi-experimental design was employed. Nursing interns were assigned to an intervention group (virtual simulation) or a control group (traditional face-to-face training). Self-directed learning ability and clinical thinking skills were assessed using the validated Independent Learning Ability Scale and Clinical Thinking Skills Scale. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were conducted, and data were analyzed using independent
              t
              -tests and Mann–Whitney
              U
              tests, with significance set at
              P
               &lt; .05.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              The intervention group showed significantly higher self-directed learning ability (104.53 ± 7.75 vs. 99.00 ± 13.77,
              P
               &lt; .05) and clinical thinking skills (99.71 ± 12.15 vs. 91.69 ± 17.44,
              P
               &lt; .05) compared to the control group. Within the intervention group, both abilities significantly improved from pre- to post-internship (
              P
               &lt; .05). Practical skills, including blood glucose monitoring and insulin injection, also improved, with higher scores in the intervention group. The virtual simulation program was rated as effective, with an overall score of 8.37 ± 1.20 and "Excellent" ratings for learning functionality.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            The virtual simulation-based diabetes care program significantly improved nursing interns’ learning and clinical skills.},

            Conclusion:
            Gene expression showed high levels between the moderate and severe groups, with emphasis on TMPRSS2 and IL-6 genes that performed better. Thus, there is possibly an association regarding the role of the TMPRSS2 gene and rs2070788G, as well as age and IL-6 levels for COVID-19, pointing in parallel to the considerable influence of the vaccine on the SARS-CoV-2 pathway.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel approach for trajectory tracking of a six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) collaborative robot manipulator using an adaptive fuzzy proportional derivative (PD) controller. Based on the dynamic modeling of the robot manipulator, the PD control law is designed, and the improved dung beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm is introduced using the good point set (GPS) method for population initialization and the sine strategy for convergence factor adjustment. Furthermore, a fuzzy adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the PD controller gain based on real-time errors. This article uses discrete Lyapunov iterative stability to analyze the global asymptotic stability of the robot closed-loop system. The experimental results verify that the DBO-fuzzy-PD controller is superior to the original PD controller. The ISE value is reduced from 3.4140 to 0.0384, and the IAE value is reduced from 1.9876 to 0.1843. The DBO-fuzzy-PD controller has better tracking accuracy and response speed than traditional PD. Experimental results show that the proposed DBO-fuzzy-PD controller significantly enhances the trajectory tracking performance of the 6-DOF collaborative robot manipulator.},

The study addresses key challenges, including the numerical stability and convergence of finite element implementations, with simulations of compact tension (CT) specimen fracture tests for two different steels demonstrating the accuracy and predictive capability of the GLD model. In addition, the paper delves into nonlocal damage models, presenting two key theoretical results: the attenuation of high-frequency components, where Gaussian kernels act as low-pass filters, and the connection of nonlocal formulations to a diffusion-like equation. A modified evolution equation with logarithmic terms is proposed to address excessive smoothing, and a sensitivity analysis of the length scale parameter

  abstract = {In the realm of educational data science, the utilization of advanced analytical techniques is increasingly pivotal for optimizing pedagogical methods and implementing early interventions. This study introduces a predictive model employing deep learning technology for the analysis of student learning behavior. The model’s primary objective is to detect potential learning impediments at nascent stages, thereby facilitating timely and effective educational strategies to augment learning outcomes. Despite strides in behavioral prediction, challenges persist due to the dynamic and complex nature of educational data. Addressing these challenges, the proposed model integrates sequence pattern recognition with time-series analysis. The application of the PrefixSpan algorithm initiates the process, identifying sequential patterns in student learning behaviors and elucidating their temporal progression. Subsequently, an advanced ordered funnel analysis algorithm is employed, unveiling directional associations among diverse learning patterns. The final phase involves applying independent component analysis (ICA) to enhance the multi-layer long short-term memory (Multi-LSTM) network’s structure, thus enabling precise predictions of student outcomes in the context of early interventions. The results underscore the efficacy of deep learning in deciphering intricate behavioral patterns and underscore its potential in personalized educational interventions. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the model’s capacity to harness the intricacies of educational data, thereby contributing significantly to the field of personalized education and precise teaching methodologies. The innovative aspect of this study lies in the comprehensive application of the PrefixSpan algorithm, the ordered funnel analysis algorithm, and the Multi-LSTM network architecture. A holistic model for predicting student learning behavior is proposed, coupled with early interventions, which enables educators to better understand student learning conditions and implement effective measures to enhance student learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Envisioning new kinds of operations requires systematically developing architectures, work procedures, and artifacts to support human and machine agents in coordinating within dynamic environments. Accurately predicting how envisioned operations will unfold is challenging as (1) early design-phase descriptions of architectures, work procedures, and artifacts are often underspecified, and (2) key outcomes of interest emerge from interactions between cognitive work and environmental dynamics. This paper discusses how computational simulation of work can serve as a discovery tool for envisioning future operations. We introduce a three-phase approach using the Work Models that Compute (WMC) framework, which involves converting paper-based representations of work into computational models, developing scenarios and test conditions, and simulating work dynamics to analyze emergent behaviors. We illustrate this approach through a case study on developing contingency management procedures for envisioned air transport operations, specifically Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The case study demonstrates how computational simulation can (1) reveal the need for clearer design specifications, (2) uncover interactions and emergent behavior that may lead to undesirable outcomes, such as coordination surprises, and (3) identify trade-offs between multiple design options. Insight from simulation can complement other cognitive systems engineering methods to refine and enhance the feasibility and robustness of envisioned operations.},

  abstract = {One way to cope with crises is by attributing their ultimate causes to malevolent conspiracies. As crises are rarely simple, and may involve an interplay between multiple, co-occurring threats, we suggest that conspiracy thinking mainly occurs among individuals who experience conditions of threat complexity – such as socioeconomic vulnerability paired with a sense of helplessness in society, and who are also sufficiently paranoid to infer a conspiracy. In the present study, we focused on financial strain and disempowerment, as two relevant threats which were both dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and hypothesized a three-way interaction between financial strain, disempowerment and paranoia in predicting conspiracy thinking. This hypothesis was supported in both cross-national (

  abstract = {Mudstone is extensively distributed in the open-pit mining area of Xianfeng Coal Mine in Yunnan, China. Since 2018, with the continuous rainfall, mudstone landslide has gradually emerged as a serious issue in the region. However, there are currently scarce research reports on rainfall-induced mudstone landslide. Therefore, this paper takes the northern slope of the Xianfeng Coal Mine as an example. Based on on-site field investigations and real-time monitoring data, the paper, while analyzing the characteristics of slope deformation, elucidates the impact of rainfall and geological lithology on the superficial failure of landslides. Analysis of existing data indicates that during sustained periods of rainfall, the infiltration process of rainwater undergoes a transformation. Initially, a major portion of the rainwater flows along the surface of the slope, while in the later stages, a significant portion of it infiltrates vertically along the slope surface and cracks. Consequently, the mode of slope deterioration also undergoes a transformation. Additionally, under the influence of rainfall infiltration, the mudstone layer at the base of the slope undergoes expansive deformation, resulting in a significant reduction in the shear strength of the slope.},

  abstract = {With the increasing maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in the field of educational management has become an important way to improve the quality and efficiency of education. In particular, in music education management, the introduction of AI technology has brought revolutionary changes to the traditional education model. This paper first discusses the application background of AI in music education management and the opportunities and challenges it brings, especially the potential impacts on teaching quality assessment, resource allocation, and educational policy formulation. However, current research shows that existing AI application methods have deficiencies in processing complex data, algorithm generalization capabilities, and adaptability to specific music education scenarios. In response to these deficiencies, this paper proposes two research contents: one is an intelligent decision support system based on an improved actor-critic framework, aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of music education management by simulating complex decision-making processes; the other is using a time series prediction model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the technology trends in music education, which can capture educational dynamics and provide data support for future educational policies and resource allocation. The research in this paper not only provides new theoretical and practical perspectives for the application of AI in the field of music education management but also provides a scientific basis for the realization of personalized and precise management in music education.},

  abstract = {The traditional library recommendation method mainly relies on manual analysis of readers’ reading history, book classification, and user feedback to achieve personalized recommendation, but this method has limitations such as low efficiency and difficulty in accurately capturing users’ complex needs. In view of this, this paper innovatively designs a recommendation system based on Wide &amp; Deep model. The system utilizes a linear model (Wide part) to process hand-constructed features as a way to remember specific user behavioural patterns; at the same time, high-dimensional sparse features are processed with the help of a deep neural network (Deep part) to capture the complex relationship between user interests. After both outputs are further processed by the fully connected layer, the model outputs the probability distribution of each category through Softmax function and then predicts the book categories that users may be interested in. The experimental results show that the model has excellent performance, with an AUC score of over 99%, showing a strong differentiation ability; precision is close to 97%, recall is close to 96%, and F1 value is close to 54%, which not only can accurately recommend the book resources that the user is interested in but also can effectively cover the diversified needs of the user, and provide a better solution for personalized recommendation service in libraries.},

By performing convolution operations on features at different scales and using attention mechanism to emphasize the features of the diseased area, the model can better capture the subtle features of the disease. Experimental results show that MSAM-YOLO improves the original model by 4% in grape leaf disease identification task, with higher accuracy and real-time performance.

  abstract = {In choral performances, the choral conductor’s gesture recognition is crucial, as it directly affects the overall performance of the choir. The posture recognition of choral conductors focuses on static states. This recognition method is difficult to fully capture spatial and temporal information, and has a slow response speed, which affects recognition accuracy and real-time performance. Based on OpenPose, this article developed an Inception-LSTM-TSN hybrid CNN model for posture recognition of choral commanders. Firstly, the pose extraction network VGG19 in the OpenPose algorithm was replaced with MobileNet-V3, and then a CNN network for two-stream pose recognition was constructed. The Inception network was then introduced to extract temporal information, the LSTM network was used to extract temporal information, and the EfficientNet-B3 optimized TSN was used for segmentation to obtain image information for choral commander pose recognition. Finally, the results of the two branches of the constructed hybrid two-stream convolutional neural network (H2SCNN) model can be fused using the average fusion method to output the choral conductor pose recognition results. The experiment was based on the publicly available dataset ConductorMotion100 and the self-built dataset CCD for choral conductor pose recognition. The results showed that the pose recognition performance of ConductorMotion100 in the public dataset was better than that of the self-built dataset CCD. The accuracy of H2SCNN model was as high as 97.8%, which was 7.1% higher than VGG19 static image processing, and the parameter size was only 32.7 M. The experimental results show that the H2SCNN model, combined with spatial and temporal information, significantly improves the accuracy of pose recognition, achieves good real-time performance, and greatly ensures the smooth performance of the choir.},

This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of a TSF proposed for decommissioning under seismic loading using the finite element time-history method. The study comprehensively analyzes dynamic deformation, seismic-induced permanent deformation, and pore water pressure changes, while identifying potential liquefaction zones and slope safety factors after seismic events. Results show that stress levels in the tailings dam remain low under applied dynamic loads, indicating a significant safety margin. Liquefaction zones are mainly concentrated in the shallow surface layers of the tailings beach, particularly in the fine sand and silt layers, with no liquefaction observed in the dam slope. The dam body’s deformation accumulates over the duration of seismic shaking, reaching a final value of 11.95 cm. The minimum slope safety factors during seismic events meet regulatory requirements, confirming dam slope stability. The findings provide a scientific basis for the design of TSF decommissioning projects.},

Traditional maintenance procedures are frequently costly, risky, and time-consuming, with staff working directly on live wires. The use of virtual reality (VR) modeling and simulation, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), provides a novel method for improving the design, planning, and maintenance of such systems. The major goal of this research is to create a VR-based platform that incorporates a Shark Nose Optimizer with Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (Shark-GBDT) algorithms for simulating the behavior of LL-PDN, enabling engineers to visualize, and forecast problems before it happens. It uses VR modeling approaches to rebuild power systems and Shark-GBDT-driven predictive models to predict possible faults or maintenance demands. Key findings show that the VR simulation enhances design and defect detection accuracy, allowing for real-time visualizations that aid decision-making. The proposed method is implemented using Python software. In a comparative analysis, the suggested method is assessed with various evaluation measures such as fault detection accuracy (94%), prediction accuracy (93%), time to identify faults (2100 seconds), maintenance downtime (13,800 seconds) and cost of maintenance (70,000). The Shark-GBDT method improves these simulations by detecting possible faults based on prior performance data, optimizing maintenance scheduling, and reducing downtime. Finally, combining VR modeling with AI in the maintenance of live-line power distribution networks appears to be a potential strategy for improving power transmission system efficiency and safety.},

As of January 2024, the total number of charging infrastructure nationwide has reached 8.861 million units, a year-on-year increase of 63.7%, and there are 3624 battery swap stations. The popularity of new energy vehicles puts forward higher requirements for charging infrastructure. As an important supply station for new energy vehicles, public charging, and swapping stations have new energy access, energy storage configuration, and topology that directly affect charging efficiency, grid stability, and economy. This paper profoundly studies the new energy access, storage configuration, and public charging and swapping station topology. Analysis shows that new energy access has significant advantages. Experimental data show that in some areas with sufficient sunlight, using solar photovoltaic panels as the primary energy access method can provide up to 30% of energy supply, significantly reducing operating costs and carbon emissions. Energy storage system configuration is equally critical. By establishing an optimization model, the influence of different energy storage devices on the operating efficiency of charging and swapping stations is analyzed. Experimental results show that using a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system, combined with appropriate charging and discharging strategies, can significantly improve energy utilization and response speed, provide power support during peak hours, smooth power grid fluctuations, and improve stability.},

The analysis is performed for two helical wind turbine models with three- and four-blade configurations and under different operating conditions. Numerical simulations are performed using the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes method, along with the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic analogy. Validation of the performance of the computational model against experimental data demonstrates its ability to accurately predict the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic behavior of the turbine. The influence of the number of turbine blades and their distance from the center of the turbine on the generated noise is analyzed. The analysis is further focused on the highest power coefficient, obtained at the tip speed ratio of 1.8, and the sound pressure level (SPL) curves recorded by the receivers are analyzed. Predictions show that while the four-blade turbine has a higher SPL than the three-blade one at a downstream position of about four turbine diameters, the situation is reversed at farther downstream positions. The aeroacoustic findings of this research have direct implications for the proper installation of small vertical-axis Darrieus wind turbines in urban areas, where wind turbine generated noise is important.},

  abstract = {In the context of accelerated globalization, the prominence of spoken English for cross-cultural communication has been underscored. A growing demand exists for objective, large-scale, and efficient evaluations of spoken English. Artificial intelligence (AI) has consequently been rigorously investigated and incorporated in spoken English evaluation. Nonetheless, much of the existing research tends to focus on singular evaluation dimensions, leading to performance limitations when confronted with diverse, stylistically varied, or cross-cultural English samples. In this study, multiple dimensions of spoken English evaluation are explored, and a novel evaluation model, utilizing adversarial training networks, is introduced. The aspiration is to elevate the accuracy and extensive adaptability of such evaluations.},

  abstract = {This article explores active labor market policies through a utopian lens, focusing on Swedish municipal activation services. Users of such services participated in visionary workshops and were invited to dream about what could be different in their (working) lives. In the analysis of the participants’ dreams, a tension between the internalization of and resistance to employability narratives, market logics, and capitalist structures emerges. By examining these dynamics, the article demonstrates how utopian thinking, rooted in experiences from the margins of the labor market, can inspire critiques of current labor systems and help in envisioning possible futures.},

  abstract = {With the boom of national sports, basketball is widely popular as a competitive sport. In basketball, footwork is particularly important. The transition of footwork creates a corresponding movement trajectory, and the analysis of both helps to improve the skill level of players. In order to identify the player’s stride, this study uses a smart insole containing sensors to extract the angular velocity and acceleration values of the stride and perform normalized preprocessing, and then operates the values according to the proposed Double Model Convolutional Neural Network (DMCNN) algorithm, and the advanced features of the steps are extracted to complete the recognition of the steps. Also, this study depicts the player’s motion trajectory based on the quadratic method and analyzes it. The experimental results show that the DMCNN algorithm is 100% accurate in recognizing all five steps and converges to a stable state at 28 iterations with a final stable fitness value of 0.15. The velocity and acceleration values transmitted by the sensors are highly consistent with the real values, and the trajectories depicted basically coincide with the real paths. Therefore, this study proves the effectiveness of the DMCNN algorithm in step recognition and the accuracy of the depicted motion trajectory.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of information technology promotes the rapid application of VR. Dance education is an important part of higher education, which has an extremely important impact on the mental health and comprehensive quality of college students. However, dance education in colleges and universities faces problems such as insufficient teaching resources, single teaching method, and difficult to assess the teaching effect. In order to solve these problems, we designed and implemented a VR technology-assisted dance education model in colleges and universities, and obtained data based on questionnaires to evaluate the relationship between VR-assisted dance education and the physical and mental health and comprehensive quality of college students. Through the experiment, we concluded that the dance education assisted by VR technology can effectively improve the comprehensive quality of students. The model cultivates students’ multifaceted abilities and levels, and enhances their competitiveness and development potential. The traditional dance education, on the other hand, has no significant effect on the comprehensive quality aspect of students. This may be due to the fact that dance education assisted by VR technology enables students to experience different dance styles, forms, and cultures in a virtual dance environment.},
