  abstract = {This research presents a novel approach for translating legal texts into machine-executable computational logic to support the automation of public sector processes. Recognizing the high-stakes implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal domains, the proposed method emphasizes explainability by integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques with natural language processing (NLP), employing scope-restricted pattern matching and grammatical parsing. The methodology involves several key steps: document structure inference from raw legal text, semantically neutral pre-processing, identification and resolution of internal and external references, contextualization of legal paragraphs, and rule extraction. The extracted rules are formalized as Prolog predicates and visualized as structured textual lists and graphical decision trees to enhance interpretability. To demonstrate the automatic extraction of explainable rules from legal text, we develop a Law-as-Code prototype and validate it through a real-world case study at the Austrian Ministry of Finance. The system successfully extracts executable rules from the Austrian Study Funding Act, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This validation not only underscores the practical applicability of our method, but also highlights promising avenues for future research, particularly the integration of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the rule extraction pipeline, while preserving traceability and explainability.},

We also provide a rigorous a priori error analysis of the DG-IGA approximations for linear eigenvalue problems.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on continuous data assimilation (CDA) for the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions. CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier–Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem with missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Then, the finite element approximation for the CDA is considered. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.},

In this paper, we propose a scheme that combines stochastic gradient descent with adaptive importance sampling with automatic step-size selection based on a stochastic Armijo-type line-search. This approach makes the method robust to the choice of the initial step-size, which would otherwise require a tuning phase that is computationally expensive or even impractical in certain big data scenarios. Moreover, we introduce different mini-batch variants to foster the practical acceleration of the original scheme. Finally, numerical experiments are presented on real datasets to validate the proposed method in the context of supervised classification problems.},

  abstract = {The integration of advanced signal processing techniques into machine learning models has gained increasing attention due to its potential to improve model performance, particularly for classification tasks. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely recognized as a powerful tool for signal classification due to its robust mathematical foundation and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. Subdivision schemes, originally developed in computer graphics for geometric modeling, offer a novel and parametric approach to feature preprocessing by iteratively refining input data through an efficient computational procedure. This paper studies the impact of subdivision schemes on SVM performance in terms of class separability and provides insights into the relationship between feature transformation and SVM response. Specifically, it investigates the theoretical and empirical implications of applying subdivision schemes to input features in SVM-based classification. The conditions under which these schemes preserve or enhance class separability are analyzed, focusing on the tension parameter which governs both the smoothness properties of the limit curve and the subdivision rule at each iteration. An estimation method for the tension parameter from the training data is also provided. Experimental results, performed in the context of signal classification based on the wavelet scattering transform, demonstrate that the appropriate selection of the tension parameter of the scheme can significantly enhance class separability, highlighting that subdivision schemes are a promising tool for improving classification accuracy in machine learning workflows.},

  abstract = {We propose and analyze a new mixed variational formulation for the coupling of the convective Brinkman–Forchheimer and Maxwell equations for stationary magnetohydrodynamic flows in highly porous media. Besides the velocity, magnetic field, and a Lagrange multiplier associated with the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, our approach introduces a convenient translation of the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor as additional unknowns. Consequently, we obtain a five-field mixed variational formulation within a Banach space framework, where the aforementioned variables are the main unknowns of the system, exploiting the skew-symmetric property of one of the involved operators. The resulting mixed scheme is then equivalently written as a fixed-point equation, allowing the application of the well-known Banach theorem, combined with classical results on nonlinear monotone operators and a sufficiently small data assumption, to prove the unique solvability of the continuous and discrete systems. In particular, the analysis of the discrete scheme requires a quasi-uniformity assumption on the mesh. The finite element discretization involves Raviart–Thomas elements of order

The computational problem is neither known to be NP-hard nor to be in NP. We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for each of these containers based on a reduction to finding a shortest Hamiltonian path in a weighted graph, which in turn models the problem of stabbing the centers of the input balls while keeping them disjoint. We also show that for n such balls, a container of volume O ( n d − 1 d ) is always sufficient and sometimes necessary. As a byproduct, this implies that for d ⩾ 2 there is no finite size ( d + 1 ) -dimensional convex body into which all d-dimensional unit-radius balls can be packed simultaneously.},

These problems are formulated using asymptotic expansions of the solution with respect to a small parameter, which represents the characteristic size of spatial heterogeneity. When studying diffusion equations with contrasting coefficients, special attention is given to nonlocal models with weakly conducting inclusions. In this case, macro-level processes are described by integro-differential equations, where the difference kernel is determined by the solution of a nonstationary cell problem. The main contribution of this work is the development of a computational framework for the homogenization of nonstationary processes, accounting for memory effects. The effective diffusion tensor is computed using a standard numerical procedure based on finite element discretization in space. The memory kernel is approximated by a sum of exponentials obtained from solving a partial spectral problem on the periodicity cell. The nonlocal macro-level problem is transformed into a local one, where memory effects are incorporated through the solution of auxiliary nonstationary problems. Standard two-level time discretization schemes are employed, and unconditional stability of the discrete solutions is proved in appropriate norms. Key aspects of the proposed computational homogenization technique are illustrated by solving a two-dimensional model problem.},

One bottleneck of current PINNs is the computation of the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources especially when dealing with complex PDEs and high dimensional problems. To tackle this, we propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to PINNs, our framework requires less GPU memory and a shorter training time. Furthermore, the exponential convergence of the spectral basis makes our approach more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between the physics domain and the spectral domain, we provide a strategy to efficiently train networks in spectral domain.

While proficient in exploration, SOA may lack the aggressive exploitation required for swift convergence, potentially slowing down solution refinement. However, BOA might experience premature convergence in challenging milieu that results in demurrer in local optima. HBFA handles these challenges by amalgamating SOA’s unique exploration nuances with BOA’s effectual exploitation techniques, assuring an optimum exchange between orbicular and localized search. The algorithm is assessed on 23 unimodal and multimodal standard functions and six constrained mechanical design optimization problems with real-world applications. The performance of HBFA is benchmarked against nine state-of-the-art optimization methods, including PSO, SSA, and HSA, based on metrics such as best solution, average solution, and convergence rate. The results demonstrate that HBFA attains the highest performance efficiency (96.69 %), accomplishing all competitive algorithms by epochal margins, with amelioration ranging from 21 % to 63 % over conventional approaches. Notably, the proposed HBFA is 83.25 % faster in finding the optimal solution than other algorithms without falling for premature convergence and local optima. The superiority of HBFA is further validated through Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman statistical tests, with an average p-value of 3.14E-10, confirming its statistically significant advantage. Given to its adaptive nature and rapid convergence, HBFA emerges as a powerful tool for addressing complex optimization challenges in engineering, artificial intelligence, and industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Due to their wide appearance in environmental settings as well as industrial and medical applications, the Stokes–Darcy problems with different sets of interface conditions establish an active research area in the community of mathematical modelers and computational scientists. For numerical simulation of such coupled problems in applications, robust and efficient computational algorithms are needed. In this work, we consider a generalization of the Beavers–Joseph interface condition recently developed using homogenization and boundary layer theory. This extension is applicable not only for the parallel flows to the fluid–porous interface as its predecessor, but also for arbitrary flow directions. To solve the Stokes–Darcy problem with these generalized interface conditions efficiently, we develop and analyze a Robin–Robin domain decomposition method using Fourier analysis to identify optimal weights in the Robin interface conditions. We study efficiency and robustness of the proposed method and provide numerical simulations which confirm the obtained theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Splitting methods constitute a well-established class of numerical schemes for solving convection–diffusion–reaction problems. They have been shown to be effective in solving problems with periodic boundary conditions. However, in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions, order reduction has been observed even with homogeneous boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel splitting approach, the so-called initial-corrected splitting method, which succeeds in overcoming order reduction. A convergence analysis is performed to demonstrate, up to a logarithmic factor, second-order convergence of this modified Strang splitting method. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the newly developed splitting approach.},

  abstract = {Time-evolving perforated domains arise in many engineering and geoscientific applications, including reactive transport, particle deposition, and structural degradation in porous media. Accurately capturing the macroscopic behavior of such systems poses significant computational challenges due to the dynamic fine-scale geometries. In this paper, we develop a robust and generalizable multiscale modeling framework based on multicontinuum homogenization to derive effective macroscopic equations in shrinking domains. The method distinguishes multiple continua according to the physical characteristics (e.g., channel widths), and couples them via space–time local cell problems formulated on representative volume elements. These local problems incorporate temporal derivatives and domain evolution, ensuring consistency with underlying fine-scale dynamics. The resulting upscaled system yields computable macroscopic coefficients and is suitable for large-scale simulations. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and potential applicability of the method to complex time-dependent engineering problems.},

A special case of this paradigm has been proposed earlier for geometric intersection graphs. Here, we propose and analyse a much more general formulation. As part of this formulation, we introduce a new graph parameter which plays a role in bounding the approximation factor of the algorithms. By applying this paradigm to intersection graph classes of specific types of geometric objects, we obtain efficient algorithms which approximate a MWIS within

  abstract = {The approximation of data is a fundamental challenge encountered in various fields, including computer-aided geometric design, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, or the design of curves and surfaces. Numerous methods have been developed to address this issue, providing good results when the data is continuous. Among these, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) method has proven to be an effective strategy for fitting data, finding applications in both statistics and applied mathematics. However, the presence of isolated discontinuities in the data can lead to undesirable artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon, which adversely affects the quality of the approximation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Moving Least Squares method with the well-established non-linear Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method. This combination aims to construct a non-linear operator that enhances the accuracy of approximations near discontinuities while maintaining the order of accuracy in smooth regions. We investigate the properties of this operator in one dimension, demonstrating its effectiveness through a series of numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {The construction of B-spline wavelet bases on nonequispaced knots is extended to wavelets that are piecewise segments from any combination of smooth functions. The extended wavelet family thus provides multiresolution basis functions with support as compact as possible and belonging to a user controlled smoothness class. The construction proceeds in two phases. In the first phase of segmentation, a set of smooth functions is used in the welding of compact supported, piecewise smooth basis functions. These piecewise smooth basis functions are refinable, meaning that they can be written as linear combinations of similar basis functions constructed on a finer grid of knots. The expression of the linear combination between the bases at two scales is known as a refinement or two-scale equation. In the second phase, the refinability enables the construction of a wavelet transform. To this end, the refinement equation of the piecewise smooth scaling functions is factored into a lifting scheme, to which the desired properties of the subsequent wavelet basis can then be added. Special attention is paid to proper boundary treatment. Next to the details of the construction, the paper discusses the conditions for it to fit into the classical framework of multiresolution analyses.},

This framework could embed delay differential equations into neural networks to accommodate the diverse requirements of DDEs in terms of initial conditions, control equations, and known data. PINN-DDEs adjust the network parameters through automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms to minimize the loss function, thereby obtaining numerical solutions to the delay differential equations without the grid dependence and polynomial interpolation typical of traditional numerical methods. In addressing inverse problems, the PINN-DDEs framework can utilize observational data to perform precise estimation of single or multiple delay parameters, which is very important in practical mathematical modeling. The results of multiple numerical experiments have shown that PINN-DDEs demonstrate high precision in both forward and inverse problems, proving their effectiveness and promising potential in dealing with delayed differential equation issues.},

To achieve accurate estimation, prior knowledge is crucial. In this paper, we introduce the total curvature on image surface regularization prior, utilizing the image’s geometric features. This prior preserves sharp edges in the intermediate latent image and enhances the restoration of the blur kernel. We then propose a total curvature weighted image surface minimization model.

We show that the diagonal elements of the uncoupling matrices steadily decrease as one moves away from the main diagonal, highlighting the diminishing effect of mutual coupling and the predominance of self-coupling over mutual coupling. Finally, an 8-element signal flow graph will be presented to show the uncoupling of mutual coupling effects of antenna arrays in digital signal processing perspective.},

  abstract = {For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of n points in R d , there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree at least log ⁡ n / ( 4 d ) . Apart from the 1 / ( 4 d ) factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every n-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree Ω ( log ⁡ n / log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) .},

  abstract = {In this study, mathematical modeling of diabetes disease is handled with the Caputo fractional derivative, and the resulting fractional differential equation system is examined in detail. The existence of the solution of this system was mathematically proven under appropriate conditions. Then, for the management and treatment of diabetes, three control parameters are added, and the number of people with diabetes is tried to be kept in the desired range with the optimal control theory. In addition to this, our model gains from parameter estimation and fitting with more accurately generated parameters. The numerical results of the fractional model and the effect of the control parameters are determined with the optimal control approach on glucose levels, examined with various simulations, and presented graphically.},

  abstract = {Trajectory planning for port handling equipment is crucial for efficient and safe industrial operations. However, this task is significantly challenged by parameter uncertainties. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel robust trajectory planning strategy. The method formulates the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem using polynomial chaos expansion and solves it through an adaptive sequential convex optimization algorithm. The strategy is applied to two common port handling equipment systems, validating its effectiveness in handling parameter uncertainties. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances computational efficiency by at least 45% and achieves greater consistency and robustness compared to existing advanced methods, with its outcomes closely aligning Monte Carlo simulations. The key contributions include a new robust trajectory planning approach, improved prediction accuracy via simultaneous state and control variable expansion, and enhanced computational efficiency for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, by making use of the implicit fixed-point equation of the horizontal quasi-complementarity problem (HQCP) and the relations between the auxiliary vectors and solution vectors, we design a modified modulus-based matrix splitting (MMMS) iteration method for solving the HQCP. Compared with the MMS method (Commu. Appl. Math. Comput., 2023) proposed very recently, the MMMS iteration method does not involve inner iterations and its initial vector can be adopted unlimitedly. And it is no need to solve a linear subsystem with the coefficient matrix 
                        B
                      in each iteration of the MMMS method. Hence the proposed MMMS method may own higher computational efficiency than the MMS one in practical application. Besides, we study the convergence conditions of the MMMS iteration method for two types of system matrices, which contain and generalize some related results. Also, the selection method for the parameter matrix of the MMMS method is proposed. At the end, the effectiveness and superiority of the MMMS method are verified by numerical experiments.},

                               field of view are always sufficient to guard the free space (avoiding all the polygons). This answers another conjecture of Daescu and Malik (2021) [8].
                        
                      Both upper bounds are tight in the sense that there are input instances that require these many cameras. Our proofs are constructive and suggest simple polynomial-time algorithms for placing these many cameras.
                  We then generalize the above bounds to arbitrary convex-shape buildings. We can guard the free space of k buildings of total size m by 
                        m
                        −
                        k

                        1
                      cameras. For k simple polygons with c convex vertices in the plane we can guard the free space by 
                        c
                        −
                        k

                      cameras. Again, both these bounds are tight.},

To achieve more successful results, improvements are made on these metaheuristic algorithms. This study aims to enhance the performance of the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) Algorithm, a neighborhood-based metaheuristic algorithm. To this end, MBO is implemented on a high-performance computing (HPC) architecture using Open MPI, and the Multi-Island Distributed Migrating Birds Optimization (MIDMBO) Algorithm is developed. MIDMBO is a distributed metaheuristic optimization algorithm that utilizes multiple islands, where successful solutions migrate between islands. The migration process between islands, facilitated by MPI, enables MIDMBO to generate more successful outcomes. Therefore, studies focused on the migration process are of great importance. In this study, the relationship between algorithm performance and variations in fundamental migration parameters such as migration rate, migration interval, and the number of islands is examined. Regression analyses are performed on the results obtained from MIDMBO, and the model that best explains performance variation is identified. Additionally, artificial neural network (ANN) models are constructed, and the degree to which changes in parameter values explain the results is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Many practical applications of Navier–Stokes problems require solving sequences of saddle-point systems. These systems often arise from the mixed-finite element discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations. A popular strategy to solve them is by combining preconditioning techniques with Krylov subspace methods, which has proven effective in achieving computational efficiency. Since global Krylov subspace methods are specifically designed for solving saddle-point problems with multiple right-hand sides, they cannot be utilized to solve sequences of these problems. We propose an alternative approach applicable to matrices with a saddle-point structure. In this new approach, projection into the null-space of the block-(2,1) of the saddle-point matrix leads to a linear system with several right-hand sides. Due to the large scale and ill-conditioned nature of these linear systems, effective solvers must be implemented. Instead of applying a standard iterative method to solve each linear system independently, it is often more effective to apply a global method. Here, we develop and assess various methods for solving linear systems with several right-hand sides, with a special focus on the preconditioned global conjugate gradient (PGCG) method. We show that our suggested approach is highly effective for sequences of saddle-point systems with varying matrices. The efficiency of our new approach is evaluated by measuring computational time.},

Lie group numerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group. Thus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as unitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems, for instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group integrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie groups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and need to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve the Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of Cayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups while being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley–Magnus methods the method is also free from nested matrix commutators.},

By assuming properties of the fractional derivative and applying the wavelet solution directly to the equation, the problem is transferred to finding the family of solutions of the system of algebraic equations, whose solutions are the coefficients of the series of wavelet solutions. The accuracy and efficiency of the Gegenbauer wavelet approach are primarily evaluated through a direct comparison against solutions generated using the Genocchi polynomials method for established test problems. The study demonstrates that the shifted Gegenbauer wavelet method provides precise and effective solutions, which were analyzed under varying resolution parameters and degrees of Gegenbauer polynomials.},

We present an algorithm for computing the transformed recurrence coefficients and determinantal formulas for the transformed multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II. We apply these results to show that zeros of multiple orthogonal polynomials of an Angelesco or an AT system interlace with the zeros of the polynomials corresponding to its one-step Christoffel transform. This allows us to prove a number of interlacing properties satisfied by the multiple orthogonality analogues of classical orthogonal polynomials. For the discrete polynomials, this also produces an estimate on the smallest distance between consecutive zeros. We also identify a connection between the Christoffel transform of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonality systems containing a finitely supported measure. In consequence, the compatibility relations for the nearest neighbour recurrence coefficients provide a new algorithm for the computation of the Jacobi coefficients of the one-step or multi-step Christoffel transforms.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the inverses and determinants of generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices. We first present an explicit formula for the inverses of these matrices, based on tensor products and the inverses of general anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices. An efficient algorithm for matrix inversion is then proposed, reducing memory requirements for storing these matrices and simplifying analysis by leveraging the properties of tensor products. Additionally, we introduce a cost-effective algorithm for computing the determinants of generalized anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrices, transforming the problem into that of lower-order anti-tridiagonal Hankel matrix determinants. We also derive an explicit formula for determinant evaluation. Numerical results from MATLAB simulations demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and performance of the proposed algorithms, which are compared to MATLAB built-in functions, showing clear advantages in computational accuracy and speed.},

The model describes the evolution of endothelial cells, proteases, inhibitors, and extracellular matrix through coupled equations incorporating diffusion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and reaction kinetics. We design a numerical approach that manages stiff linear terms implicitly while handling non-stiff nonlinear terms explicitly. Theoretical analysis establishes main features of the scheme such as stability properties, second-order convergence, and preservation of conservation laws. Moreover, the computational complexity is analyzed, demonstrating an efficiency gains compared to fully explicit methods. Numerical experiments validate these findings and show the ability of the method to accurately capture complex biological phenomena.},

  abstract = {This study presents an efficient numerical framework for solving an inverse heat equation problem involving a time-dependent heat source and temperature distribution. The problem incorporates non-classical boundary conditions and integral over-determination conditions, where the latter represents error-contaminated measurements. A time-stepping scheme is employed to discretize the time derivative, while a meshless local collocation method using radial basis functions (RBFs) is applied for spatial discretization. The stability and convergence of the time-discretized approach are rigorously established using the energy method. To address noise in input data, Tikhonov regularization of three orders is implemented, along with a novel approach for determining the optimal regularization parameter. This method outperforms traditional techniques such as the quasi-optimality criterion, L-curve, and discrepancy principle. Numerical experiments validate the approach by demonstrating its accuracy for exact data and stability under noisy conditions, thereby establishing it as a reliable tool for inverse problem-solving.},

A relaxation technique is employed to correct the numerical errors of the scalar auxiliary variable. The scheme is proved to be unconditionally energy stable. We perform several numerical experiments for wetting phenomena on flat, curved and rough substrates, demonstrating the capability of our proposed numerical scheme.

  abstract = {In this paper, the stability of IMEX-BDF methods for delay differential equations (DDEs) is studied based on the test equation y ′ ( t ) = − A y ( t ) + B y ( t − τ ) , where τ is a constant delay, A diagonalizes in R + , but B might be any matrix. First, it is analyzed the case where both matrices diagonalize simultaneously, and sufficient conditions to obtain linear stability are proved. However, the paper focuses on the case where the matrices A and B are not simultaneously diagonalizable. The concept of field of values, denoted by F ( ⋅ ) , is used to prove a sufficient condition for unconditional stability of these methods: if A is Hermitian, IMEX-BDF2 is unconditionally stable whenever F ( A − 1 B ) is contained in the disk centered at 0 and radius 1 3 , D ( 0 , 1 3 ) , while IMEX-BDF3 is unconditionally stable whenever F ( A − 1 B ) ⊆ D ( 0 , 1 7 ) . Furthermore, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stability, but according to the step size as a function of the radius of the disk containing F ( A − 1 B ) . The approach developed herein is illustrated through several examples in which the discussed theory is applied not only to DDEs, but also to parabolic problems given by partial delay differential equations (PDDEs) with a diffusion term.},

This research examines the impact of contact with nature on creative thinking in tourism compared to everyday contexts through a mixed-methods approach involving an online survey (Study 1: N = 438), a scenario-based experiment (Study 2: N = 300), and a field survey conducted at Beijing Olympic Forest Park (Study 3: N = 164). The results demonstrate that contact with nature during tourism significantly enhances creative thinking compared to everyday contexts. Mental bandwidth partially mediates this dynamic, with openness to experience further moderating the impact of nature contact contexts on mental bandwidth. These findings advance the literature by highlighting the distinctive social and psychological benefits of tourism in promoting creativity beyond what is typically experienced in everyday life.},

We examine various properties of these fractal cubic multiquadric approximants, such as shape-preserving characteristics and the ability to reproduce quadratic polynomials. Error estimates for these approximants are also derived, and estimates for the box-dimension of the graphs of fractal cubic multiquadric approximants are given. Numerical examples are presented to validate these theoretical findings and highlight the benefits of the fractal quasi-interpolant L d α f . Additionally, we apply the proposed fractal quasi-interpolants to solve an integral equation with a non-smooth degenerate kernel. This approach shows a high rate of convergence to the exact solution. Box-dimension results for the numerical solution of this integral equation are also established.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel domain-based regularization approach for estimating landslide thickness from surface velocity data. Such quantity is crucial for accurately assessing landslides behavior, potential impact, and associated risks. Here, we formulate the problem as an ill-posed inverse problem and propose, for its solution, a multipenalty regularization approach based on the decomposition of the landslide domain in several regions with uniform magnitude of the horizontal velocity. We extend the Balancing Principle to accommodate non-constant balancing parameters across decomposed regions. Our Domain-based Majorization-Minimization algorithm converges to solutions that satisfy this extended principle, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. Through rigorous testing on both synthetic and real-world landslide data, we show that strategic domain decomposition based on velocity field homogeneity enhances estimation accuracy. Our findings reveal that while excessive subdivision is counterproductive, identifying appropriate velocity-based macro-regions yields optimal results. This methodology provides more reliable thickness estimates crucial for landslide risk assessment and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of semiconductor device with heat and magnetic influences is a preliminary problem in information science. In this paper, mathematical model, numerical method and theoretical analysis are discussed. Four major physical unknowns (the potential, electron concentration, hole concentration, and the heat) are defined by several nonlinear PDEs, an elliptic equation, two convection–diffusion equations and a heat conductor equation. A block-centered numerical method with conservative nature is used to obtain the potential, and the computational accuracy is improved. An upwind block-centered difference method is adopted for solving other PDEs on changing meshes. The diffusion and convection operators are discretized by block-centered differences and upwind differences, respectively. Changing meshes are effective for simulating the status nearby P-N junction. The composite scheme avoids numerical dispersion and nonphysical oscillation, and the conservation is preserved. The unknowns and their adjoint vectors are computed at the same time. Some theoretical techniques such as energy norm estimates, the method of duality and mathematical induction are used to finish convergence analysis. Error results are concluded. Finally, numerical examples show the efficiency and possible application.},

The proof technique employs a unified framework integrating the semi-group properties of integer-order calculus with fractional operators and proceeds via a counterfactual argument by assuming the existence of a non-oscillatory solution and deriving a contradiction. The results presented here significantly extend the existing oscillation theory for fractional differential equations with multiple derivatives. The theoretical findings are further illustrated with some examples.},

  abstract = {Inverse magnetisation problem consists in inferring information about a magnetic source from measurements of its magnetic field. Unlike a general magnetisation distribution, the total magnetisation (net moment) of the source is a quantity that theoretically can be uniquely determined from the field. At the same time, it is often the most useful quantity for practical applications (on large and small scales) such as detection of a magnetic anomaly in magnetic prospection problem or finding the overall strength and mean direction of the magnetisation distribution of a magnetised rock sample. It is known that the net moment components can be explicitly estimated using the so-called Helbig’s integrals which involve integration of the magnetic field data on the plane against simple polynomials. Evaluation of these integrals requires knowledge of the magnetic field data on a large region or the use of ad hoc methods to compensate for the lack thereof. In this paper, we derive higher-order analogs of Helbig’s integrals which permit estimation of total magnetisation components in terms of measurement data available on a smaller region. Motivated by a concrete experimental setup for analysing remanent magnetisation of rock samples with a scanning microscope, we also extend Helbig’s integrals to the situation when knowledge of only one field component is necessary. Moreover, apart from derivation of these novel formulas, we rigorously prove their accuracy. The presented approach, based on an appropriate splitting in the Fourier domain and estimates of oscillatory integrals (involving both small and large parameters), elucidates the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the net moment components to an arbitrary order, a possibility that was previously unclear. The obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect to the noise is discussed.},

  abstract = {Recently, Multiway Delay-embedding Transform (MDT)-based low-rank tensor completion has achieved a lot of attention for color image recovery. However, existing studies mostly focus on tensor decomposition to encode the low-rankness of the Hankel tensor derived from MDT, which are sensitive to the predefined rank and limit the recovery performance. Aiming at addressing this issue, in this paper, we use the High-order Tensor Nuclear Norm (HTNN) to approximate the Hankel tensor rank, thus a new model named MDT-HTNN is proposed for low-rank tensor completion. Efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the proposed model and its convergence analysis is discussed in detail. Extensive experiments on a series of color images and MRI illustrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improve the recovery accuracy. Specifically, under multiple sampling rate settings for multiple color images, the average PSNR value increased by 14.8% and the CPU time decreased by 89.5% compared with the classical MDT-Tucker method.},

We propose a method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the solution of this inverse problem. Within this framework, we design a novel loss function that incorporates the residuals of the partial differential equation (PDE), measurement data residuals, as well as residuals from initial–boundary conditions and boundary derivatives. These additional terms enhance the regularity of the solution to address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Based on the conditional stability of the inverse problem, we demonstrate that the neural network can effectively approximate its solution, and we further establish generalization error estimates for the source term, which depend on the training error and data noise level, while also verifying the convergence of the network. A series of numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, showing that it achieves high accuracy and efficiency under noisy data and varying measurement conditions.},

This problem can be modeled using a coupled system of Stokes equations and Darcy’s law. Finite element discretization of the coupled Stokes–Darcy model results in a double saddle-point system. In this work, we propose a class of inexact block three-by-three triangular preconditioners for these discretized saddle-point systems by fully utilizing their special structure. When used to precondition Krylov subspace methods, each step requires solving only three simple symmetric positive definite linear subsystems. Additionally, we derive explicit and sharp spectral bounds for the preconditioned matrices and show that all eigenvalues have positive real parts. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our preconditioners in solving the coupled Stokes–Darcy model.},

  abstract = {Solar drying is a sustainable technique for food preservation, but its efficiency drops significantly under low solar radiation and high humidity conditions. This study addresses this challenge by integrating clinoptilolite zeolite as a passive moisture adsorbent into a thin-layer solar dryer and evaluating its effect on green pea drying performance under suboptimal spring conditions in Balıkesir, Turkey. Two experimental trials, conventional and zeolite-enhanced, were conducted on consecutive days with closely matched weather profiles.
                  The results show that zeolite integration shortened total drying time by 7.1 % (from 7.0 to 6.5 hours) and increased the peak drying rate by 42 %. A 15 % reduction in chamber relative humidity was observed, along with improved energy metrics: 4.6 % lower specific energy consumption (SEC) and 5.4 % higher specific moisture extraction rate (SMER). Six thin-layer drying models were evaluated using genetic algorithm optimization. Among them, the proposed four-parameter Karasu model outperformed others, achieving R² = 0.9968 and RMSE = 0.0174. Sensitivity analysis identified the shape parameter (n) as the most influential. Zeolite moisture uptake followed a logarithmic trend, reaching 92.6 g (18.5 g/kg). The results confirm that zeolite effectively improves drying kinetics and humidity control under challenging conditions. The Karasu model provides a reliable tool for predicting drying behavior in solar drying systems.},

A backtracking search algorithm was specifically designed to traverse the space of admissible architectural parameters, thereby implementing a constrained combinatorial strategy for neural network architecture exploration. This study introduces a practical tool for researchers aiming to identify diverse neuronal organizational patterns within hidden layers, subject to predefined hyperparameter constraints. The proposed algorithm was subsequently validated by exhaustively exploring all feasible architectural configurations for solving a two-dimensional Poisson equation using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN).},

  abstract = {Reliability engineering addresses the challenge of analyzing how components contribute to system failures when designing large and complex systems. This analysis is commonly referred to as importance analysis. One specific type of importance measure is Joint Structural Importance (JSI), which assesses the significance of two or more components based on their positions within the system. This measure helps in effectively allocating redundancy and guiding design decisions to enhance overall reliability. This paper proposes a new method for computing the JSI of independent components within a coherent system. The key idea is to utilize Logical Differential Calculus, specifically through the Direct Partial Logical Derivatives (DPLD). Applying the DPLD for calculating the JSI based on the indicator function is a novel approach. Notably, this method allows for calculating the JSI from the structure function represented by a truth table without the need to transform the function into a Boolean expression. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the application and advantages of the proposed method. Additionally, case studies on a substation automation system and an auxiliary feedwater system are conducted to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness in engineering applications.},

Their theoretical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the presented methods can attain root-exponential convergence. However, their convergence has not been strictly proved. This study improves these methods to facilitate implementation, and provides a convergence theorem for the improved method. For the same equations, another Sinc-collocation method was proposed in 2016 by John and Ogbonna, which is regarded as an improvement to the variable transformation employed by Shamloo et al.

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the valuation of American put options based on the 4/2 stochastic volatility model that incorporates multiscale double mean-reverting (DMR) volatility. The option price problem is transformed into a partial differential equation (PDE) problem with free boundary, which in turn leads to PDE problems for a few terms of asymptotic expansions of the option price and free boundary. The approximate American put price is decomposed into the sum of the corresponding European put price and the early exercise premium. The chosen modification of the 4/2 stochastic volatility allows for a step-by-step approach to the option price starting from the Black–Scholes price of the corresponding European option, making it easier to approximate the price of an American put option. We check the accuracy of the resultant approximate option price and free boundary by using the least squares Monte Carlo simulation method and investigate the impact of the Heston and 3/2 factors of the volatility on the option price and free boundary. We calibrate our model to real market data and benchmark it against the widely used Heston model and the 3/2 model. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to show how small changes in model parameters influence the American put option premium and early exercise boundary, and discuss limiting scenarios when the 3/2 term vanishes or volatility becomes deterministic. In addition, two specific results are provided. We derive a semi-analytic solution for the approximate option price and free boundary when an American put option is near expiration. We also study the pricing of an American put option without an expiration date and obtain a closed-form analytic formula for the approximate option price and free boundary.},

For polygonal domains, when polygonal pseudo-boundaries are chosen, the piecewise interpolation polynomials of low orders are used as in the finite element method (FEM) and the BEM. The error bounds are derived for smooth solutions to achieve the optimal convergence rates. This error analysis is also valid for smooth

These results are then employed to develop a numerical scheme for solving a general class of fractional integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernels. The approach, combined with the essential properties of the Caputo derivative and the Riemann–Liouville operator, leads to the definition of remainders associated with the main problem.

We first show that computing generalized eigenpairs of weakly symmetric tensors is equivalent to finding the nonzero solutions of a nonlinear system of equations, and then propose a derivative-free spectral residual method for it. The method utilizes the residual vector as the search direction and incorporates a derivative-free nonmonotone line search strategy, avoiding any explicit information associated with the Jacobian matrix of the considered nonlinear system of equations. Additionally, the global convergence of the method is established. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate superior efficiency of the proposed method through comparisons with the alternating least squares (ALS) method and other existing approaches. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed method can capture more, and in some cases all, generalized eigenvalues of weakly symmetric tensors.},

In this paper, we study the expressivity of the ExSpliNet model and present two constructive approximation results that mitigate the curse of dimensionality. More precisely, we prove new error bounds for the ExSpliNet approximation of a subset of multivariate continuous functions and also of multivariate generalized bandlimited functions. The main ingredients of the proofs are a constructive version of the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, Maurey’s theorem, and spline approximation results. The curse of dimensionality is lessened in the first case, while it is completely overcome in the second case. Since the considered ExSpliNet model can be regarded as a particular version of the recently introduced neural network architecture called Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN), our results also provide insights into the analysis of the expressivity of KANs.},

Especially the introduced Structured Deep Kernel Networks (SDKNs) can be viewed as neural networks (NNs) with optimizable activation functions obeying a representer theorem. This link allows us to analyze also NNs within the framework of kernel networks. We prove analytic properties of the SDKNs which show their universal approximation properties in three different asymptotic regimes of unbounded number of centers, width and depth.

  abstract = {Cusp-type catastrophe is the most commonly encountered and widely applicable type among elementary catastrophes. However, the canonical mathematical model of the cusp-type catastrophe, constructed using the classical regularization method in catastrophe theory, often lacks quantitative prediction capability. This issue arises from the regularization operations involved in the regularization method, particularly the Taylor expansion and truncation of the potential function, which can introduce unforeseen and potentially large regularization errors. To address this issue, a novel precise regularization method is proposed, which bypasses the Taylor expansion of the potential function and instead employs a global diffeomorphism to achieve precise regularization of the cusp-type catastrophe mathematical model. Using the proposed method, the precise regularization of the cusp-type catastrophe mathematical model for Zeeman catastrophe machine is achieved. Computational results show that the model obtained via the proposed method has significantly lower regularization errors than the classical method, thus meeting the requirements for constructing catastrophe models with quantitative predictive capability. Moreover, due to the implementation of the global diffeomorphism, the proposed precise regularization method can be easily modified into the experimental modeling approach (inverse regularization method) of catastrophe theory, enabling the development of experimental mathematical models of cusp-type catastrophe with quantitative predictive capability for specific catastrophe phenomena. Taking the chip flow angle catastrophe as an example, the detailed implementation steps of this experimental modeling approach are demonstrated. This work not only contributes to the refinement and advancement of catastrophe theory but also addresses practical challenges encountered in its application.},

Although stability intervals of the proposed methods are smaller than those of classic Chebyshev-type methods, their stability functions are more consistent with the exponent, they have more convex stability regions and smaller error constants. These properties allow the monotonic methods to be competitive with contemporary stabilized second-order methods, as the presented results of numerical experiments demonstrate.},

The proposed approach is formulated within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework, enabling simultaneous component selection and estimation in a robust manner. Furthermore, we extend the locally adaptive majorize-minimization (LAMM) principle to develop a general iterative optimization algorithm applicable to any loss function with continuous gradients. Under mild assumptions on the error distribution (without requiring sub-Gaussian tails) and standard regularity conditions, we establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed estimator. Extensive simulation studies and a real data application to fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing alternatives.},

  abstract = {Pixel mapping is a computational approach that involves the analysis of individual pixels within digital images to extract clinically relevant information. This technique offers significant advantages in medical imaging applications, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing treatment planning. By reducing the need for complex manual programming, pixel mapping also contributes to workflow efficiency. The incorporation of machine learning strategies, such as transfer learning and other advanced algorithms, has further extended the capabilities of pixel mapping by enabling the segmentation of intricate anatomical structures and the detection of pathological anomalies in medical scans. Given the global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which account for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually early diagnosis and effective clinical management remain paramount. This figure constitutes approximately 32% of all global deaths, with 85% of the deaths being because of heart attacks and strokes. In addition, 38% of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases occur at an early age in individuals under 70. Among these conditions, heart failure represents a major complication, underscoring the need for innovative diagnostic technologies like pixel-based analysis. This paper proposes an innovative hybrid model, which is Pixel Mapping Multi-Modal Medical Image -based Neural Networks (PMMI- NNs), by combining transfer and machine learning for diagnosing cardiovascular disease using pixel map images. Heart failure is also a common consequence of these diseases, which makes early diagnosis and management critical. This paper proposes an innovative hybrid model, which is Pixel Mapping Multi-Modal Medical Image -based Neural Networks (PMMI- NNs), by combining transfer and machine learning for diagnosing cardiovascular disease using pixel map images. Six different pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models extract the significant features from the images: DenseNet121, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 and MobileNetV2. The Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm is applied to improve classification accuracy and select the most discriminative features. The selected features are then classified by three machine learning algorithms, which are the k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The findings obtained by the analyses demonstrate that integration of transfer learning, feature selection, and machine learning proves to be effective in improving CVD diagnosis in medical image analysis, providing a scalable and applicable framework for future clinical applications. The primary objective of the study whose datasets include clinical and physiological signal elements is to compare different machine learning and deep learning approaches to identify the most effective methods for early diagnostic process of cardiovascular diseases.},

Further, a well-known challenge in solving nonlinear integral equations is the problem of simultaneously achieving high-order accuracy, computational efficiency and avoiding to solve nonlinear algebraic systems. For contraction maps in Banach spaces, fixed-point iterative methods can address the problem of solving systems. However, the issues of computational efficiency, high-order accuracy, and approximation of functional VFIEs remain largely unaddressed. In this article, a new cubature rule is proposed and used to develop a high (fourth) order method for nonlinear functional mixed VFIEs. To ensure computational efficiency and avoid solving systems, a Gauss–Seidel-type algorithm (GSTA) is formulated. In this case of GSTA, the convergence proof becomes quite challenging (no wonder the inefficient Jacobi-type idea is very popular in the literature). We use the Banach contraction principle and mathematical induction to rigorously prove the fourth-order convergence of the method. Several numerical examples are used to verify the theoretical convergence results. It is our belief that both the numerical scheme and convergence proof presented in this paper will serve researchers in devising and analyzing efficient, high-order schemes for other integral equations, even in higher dimensions.},

In the engineering field, high Mach number flows with strong shock waves and low Mach number flows often coexist. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a numerical scheme that is both accurate and robust across all Mach number flows. The shock instabilities of the HLLEM scheme are addressed by simply modifying the wave speeds to balance advection dissipation and acoustic dissipation. Additionally, the performance in computing low-speed flows is improved by controlling the excessive numerical dissipation corresponding to the velocity-difference terms in the momentum equations. Numerical results from high Mach number test cases and low Mach number test cases demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme for simulating flows across all Mach number.},

                  The proposed methods are based on the construction of online informed spaces, which are iteratively refined to improve solution accuracy. Following an initial offline stage, where known boundary conditions are applied to construct multiscale basis functions, the informed spaces are updated through iterative procedures that utilize boundary conditions defined by the most recently computed solution variables. Two distinct approaches are introduced, each leveraging this framework to deliver efficient and accurate iterative solutions.
                  A series of numerical simulations, conducted on the SPE10 benchmark, demonstrates the very rapid convergence of the iterative solutions. These results highlight the computational efficiency and competitiveness of the two proposed methods, which are thoroughly compared to each other and to an existing multiscale iterative method from the literature.},

Although this PML model performs well in practice — exhibiting stable behavior and effectively absorbing outgoing waves — its stability has not yet been rigorously proven for general damping coefficients. To address this gap, we derive an equivalent PML model from the original formulation and establish its stability under general damping functions. We then develop a finite element scheme to solve the equivalent PML model and provide proofs for both its discrete stability and optimal error estimates. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the equivalent PML model in absorbing outgoing waves.},

Motivated by optimal transport theory, we introduce a nonlocal dispersive optimal transport (NDOT) model governed by a space–time fractional partial differential equation (PDE). We solve the NDOT formulation using the general-proximal primal–dual hybrid gradient (G-prox PDHG) algorithm, and then introduce a novel preconditioner derived from the discretization of the space–time fractional PDE to accelerate the convergence. Numerical experiments – especially those with target states represented by power functions typical of fractional differential equation solutions – show that our model substantially reduces kinetic energy costs compared with its integer-order counterparts, highlighting its effectiveness and applicability for complex phenomena such as anomalous transport in heterogeneous environments.},

Using the WTI crude oil spot prices, the parameters involved in the proposed commodity regime-switching model are estimated by expectation–maximization algorithm. We then carry out a semi-analytical formula for the commodity futures contracts and European option price written on them. We calibrate the option pricing model parameters using the flower pollination optimization algorithm based on the European call option prices in WTI crude oil market.

A Godunov type numerical scheme for the problem on moving mesh is applied. The grid motion law is based on the solution of the local Riemann discontinuity breakdown problem and forces the computational nodes to follow the wave of the greatest amplitude. The regularization mechanism prevents the degeneration of moving computational mesh and gives an estimate for the mesh compression. The proposed algorithm is tested on several typical Riemann problems with known exact solutions. The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach allows to improve the quality of the obtained numerical solution.},

The instability is discussed in the sense of expectation and variance. A truncated regularization method is used to solve the backward problem.

Resolvent analysis seeks to identify high-gain responses of a linearized input–output operator of a given physical process, hereby represented by a fluid flow system driven by external perturbations. To approximate the governing equations system, differentiation-based and integration-based Chebyshev techniques are developed. Additionally, two different strategies of a solution approximation are considered: the spectral-space (tau) approximation, and the physical-space (collocation) approximation. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of these different methods with respect to their accuracy and efficiency of computing resolvent approximation of the linearized Navier–Stokes (LNS) equations system. In addition to the LNS system, a boundary value problem in one variable is considered first, to relate the properties of the developed methods to previous findings in the literature based on simple systems. We analyze the important metrics as related to the problem of interest, which include the

  abstract = {Inquiry-based learning (IBL) has gained popularity globally and has become a focus of curriculum reform initiatives in Confucian-heritage contexts. In Taiwan, the 2019 curriculum reform has positioned inquiry as an interdisciplinary core competency for all preservice teachers. However, previous studies have indicated that preservice teachers face significant challenges during the planning stages of inquiry and have emphasized the need for explicit instruction in teacher education programs. Given that empirical studies addressing these gaps remain limited, the present study employed a case study approach to examine the effectiveness of an inquiry thinking scaffold in a 16-week foundational course in a teacher education program in Taiwan. Analyses of 16 participants’ performance and written reflections revealed that developing a coherent inquiry plan involved a steep learning curve, with challenges emerging in the early stages and evolving as learning progressed. The major challenges included achieving logical coherence and identifying research gaps. The findings support the effectiveness of the thinking scaffold and highlight the importance of fostering preservice teachers’ awareness of logical coherence, as well as engaging them in the process of knowledge construction. Although the effects were limited, this study also found that IBL experience could enhance preservice teachers’ self-efficacy for teaching inquiry. Implications for instructional and curricular adaptations to better integrate inquiry into teacher education programs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Creativity is a multifaceted construct that manifests itself in a variety of modalities. While previous research suggests that creativity is a diversified skill in school-aged children and adults, little is known about preschoolers’ creativity. This study aims to identify the structure of creativity in a sample of preschoolers (N = 83, Mage 4.40 years). We examined associations between three performance-based creativity measures and one parent-report measure of creativity. Findings from bivariate analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed substantive associations within and non-substantive associations between creativity tasks and parent-report items. Results provide preliminary evidence of diversity in performance-based assessments and unity in parent-report measures of preschool creativity. Results also showed inconsistent associations between performance-based and parent-report measures of creativity in preschool, suggesting measures are capturing different facets of preschoolers' creativity. These results shed light on the multidimensional structure of creativity, the validity of behavioural measures of creativity, and contribute to the conceptualization and assessment of creativity in early childhood.},

  abstract = {Discrete responses are frequently encountered in applications, particularly in classification problems. However, the high cost of collecting responses or labels often leads to a scarcity of samples, which significantly diminishes the accuracy of statistical inferences, particularly in high-dimensional settings. To address this limitation, transfer learning can be utilized for high-dimensional data with discrete responses by incorporating relevant source data into the target study of interest. Within the framework of generalized linear models, the case where responses are bounded are first considered, and an importance-weighted transfer learning method, referred to as IWTL-DR, is proposed. This method selects data at the individual level, thereby utilizing the source data more efficiently. Subsequently, this approach is extended to scenarios involving unbounded responses. Theoretical properties of the IWTL-DR method are established and compared with existing techniques. Extensive simulations and analyses of real data show the advantages of our approach.},

We formulate constraint cell problems in oversampled regions for flow and transport equations. By solving the cell problems, we obtain multicontinuum expansions and derive the corresponding multicontinuum equations. To check the obtained multicontinuum model, we conduct numerical experiments in different multiscale porous structures.

  abstract = {An insurance premium is defined as the product of two elements: the a priori rate, which depends on the policyholder’s observable risk characteristics at the time of contract, and the a posteriori rate, which encompasses the residual component not explained by the a priori information. This paper explores the mathematical structure of the a posteriori rate and its corresponding statistical properties. As in the cases of the Bayes premium and the credibility premium, the a posteriori rate depends on both the a priori rate and the claim history in general. However, in certain cases, such as the bonus-malus premium in auto insurance, the a posteriori rate depends solely on the claim history. We refer to such insurance premiums, where the a posteriori rate is solely a function of the claim history, as commercial insurance premiums. Although the simplified structure of commercial insurance premiums enhances communication with policyholders, it can introduce a systematic bias known as the double counting problem. The insurance literature has empirically identified this bias in bonus-malus systems. Our study extends the existing empirical analysis of bonus-malus systems to a wider range of commercial insurance premiums and provides a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that any commercial insurance premium is susceptible to the double counting problem. Then, we propose a simple solution to mitigate this issue while retaining the structural simplicity of the commercial insurance premium. Numerical analysis, including real data analysis, demonstrates the extent of the double counting problem in commercial insurance premiums and the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating this issue.},

  abstract = {Background
                  Feedback, both human and computer-assisted, plays a critical role in scaffolding learners’ development, especially within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through interaction with more knowledgeable others. While recent studies have examined the role of Generative AI (GenAI) in supporting second language learning, its potential in translation pedagogy remains underexplored.
               
                  Objectives
                  This paper examines how GenAI feedback influences learners’ performance, motivation, and preferences in an ESL translation course. Based on the sociocultural theory, it emphasizes that all feedback sources should meet learners’ developmental needs.
               
                  Methods
                  This study adopted a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design, incorporating pre- and post-tests, a composite questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. A total of 84 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three ESL translation classes. At the initial stage, all participants received tutor feedback alongside unguided peer feedback. In the subsequent intervention phase, the Control Group (CG) continued with unguided peer feedback, the Experimental Group 1 (EG1) shifted to guided peer feedback, while the Experimental Group 2 (EG2) received AI-generated feedback in place of peer feedback. Tutor feedback remained consistent across all groups. This design facilitated both within-group and between-group comparisons, allowing the study to isolate the effects of feedback structure (guided vs. unguided peer feedback) and feedback source (peer/tutor vs. GenAI feedback).
               
                  Results and conclusion
                  The study found that guided peer feedback (EG1) led to the highest performance, significantly outperforming both unguided peer feedback (CG) and GenAI feedback (EG2). Although EG2’s performance lagged behind EG1, its learners showed the greatest increase in motivation. Feedback preferences ranked as: tutor > guided peer > GenAI > unguided peer. Learners appreciated GenAI’s accuracy, but noted issues such as limited creativity and emotional connection. The study suggests that human feedback, particularly guided peer and tutor feedback, provided stronger emotional support and adaptive scaffolding, fostering deeper cognitive engagement and a more empathetic environment compared to GenAI, which is correlated with higher performance and preference gains. While qualitative responses praised GenAI for accurate and comprehensive feedback, learners identified challenges such as information overload, limited creativity, and lack of emotional connection. The study suggests a hybrid feedback strategy integrating GenAI with human interactions to enhance translation pedagogy.},

In contrast, the bilinear finite element discretization scheme (based on quadrilateral mesh discretization) demonstrates superior stability preservation. This study rigorously identifies the fundamental reasons behind the bilinear scheme’s stability through theoretical analysis and further investigates the root cause of instability in the linear scheme observed in experiments. Based on these insights, two improvement strategies are proposed: one completely eliminates the instability, while the other significantly enhances numerical stability.},

  abstract = {Robust principal component analysis (RPCA), which aims to decompose observational data into low-rank and sparse matrices, has been widely used in various machine learning and low-vision tasks. The traditional methods use nuclear norms to approximate the rank function, which makes the obtained solution seriously deviate from the real one. Therefore, we propose a new RPCA model by employing a recently proposed truncated reweighting nuclear norm as a better approximation of low-rank constraint. The proposed model could not only preserve the main information of data as much as possible, but also greatly enhance the robustness of the model against noise or outliers. To solve this model, an efficient and simple optimization algorithm is designed by exploiting the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). More importantly, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is discussed in detail and rigorously mathematically proved. Experimental results on two typical low-vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm, that is, the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of visual and quantitative effects.},

  abstract = {This research explores neural network-based numerical approximation of two-dimensional convection-dominated singularly perturbed problems on square, circular, and elliptic domains. Singularly perturbed boundary value problems pose significant challenges due to sharp boundary layers in their solutions. Additionally, the characteristic points of these domains give rise to degenerate boundary layer problems. The stiffness of these problems, caused by sharp singular layers, can lead to substantial computational errors if not properly addressed. Conventional neural network-based approaches often fail to capture these sharp transitions accurately, highlighting a critical flaw in machine learning methods. To address these issues, we conduct a thorough boundary layer analysis to enhance our understanding of sharp transitions within the boundary layers, guiding the application of numerical methods. Specifically, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to better handle these boundary layer problems. However, PINNs may struggle with rapidly varying singularly perturbed solutions in small domain regions, leading to inaccurate or unstable results. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-analytic method that augments PINNs with singular layers or corrector functions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and stability, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Refractory medium entropy alloys (RMEAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their exceptional mechanical properties and high-temperature stability, making them suitable for a number of advanced applications. While computational modelling such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) are powerful for investigating RMEAs, these traditional methods are often constrained by high computational cost and limited accuracy. In this work, a deep neural network potential (DNNP) was developed to address the complex compositional nature of FeCr2V-based RMEAs with varying levels of tungsten doping. The DNNP demonstrated high accuracy, comparable to that of DFT calculations. Utilizing the DNNP, high-accuracy MD simulations were conducted to examine large-scale effects, including short-range ordering (SRO), twining, and dislocation behaviour, on the mechanical properties of the RMEAs. The results indicate that in the SRO structure, the covalency of V-V, Cr-Cr, and V-W ordered atomic pairs enhances local bonding strength and increases the elastic modulus of the RMEA. As the simulation temperature increases, dislocation mobility improves while dislocation density decreases, thereby enhancing the ductility of the material. Above 823 K, the SRO structure demonstrates superior mechanical performance, which is attributed to the increased length of 1/2 < 111>, dislocations facilitated by the formation of Cr-Fe and Cr-Cr ordered twins. This work underscores the potential of DNNP and MD simulations in predicting and analyzing the mechanical properties of RMEAs, advancing their development for various applications.},

This study employed Diffusion of Innovations Theory and mixed-methods approach to examine pre-service biology teachers’ (PSBTs) perceptions of developing and integrating mAR in future teaching. Participants received training to develop their own mAR teaching content. Data are collected with using questionnaires and audio recorded discussions during training. Qualitative data were processed using content analysis, while quantitative data underwent descriptive statistics and Spearman's rank correlation. Results confirm that PSBTs are eager to produce and employ mAR materials in teaching. They believe such development stimulates creativity and fosters collaboration among teachers. Results indicate that PSBT are having opinions that teachers’ developed mAR resources can better address students’ needs, promote critical thinking, and enable hands-on experimentation that might otherwise be unfeasible. PSBTs also note that these materials can be blended with traditional tools and real-world natural surroundings, enhancing students’ connection with nature. However, technical complexity, accessibility of digital resources needs for mAR development, and lack of institutional support pose obstacles. Nonetheless, quantitative outcomes reveal a positive overall perception of mAR’s impact on teaching quality and student motivation, though PSBTs highlight the importance of ongoing training and stronger alliances with colleagues and educational managers.},

  abstract = {Scientific argumentation is a key competency in science education, yet creating effective online environments to support it remains a challenging task. Recent research in science education has focused on using online gamified learning as a means to cultivate scientific argumentation skills. This study introduces “hypotheticality” as a unidimensional construct in online learning contexts. Hypotheticality can be applied to both gamified learning and scientific topics. By categorizing three degrees of hypotheticality from low to high, learners acquire distinct learning experiences in direct, vicarious, and hypothetical contexts, progressing from reality to imagination. The study further explores how hypotheticality and gamified learning impact students’ scientific knowledge, motivation, and argumentation learnings. A quasi-experimental design was adopted, involving 254 eighth graders. An online learning platform was developed specifically for the study, using a baseball player’s career as the narrative setting and incorporating online scaffolding to facilitate collaborative scientific argumentation. The four components of scientific argumentation—claim, warrant, rebuttal, and qualifier—were analyzed in terms of their frequency and quality. Statistical analysis revealed an interaction between the two variables, demonstrating that gamified learning had the most positive impact in contexts with the highest degree of hypotheticality. Subsequent qualitative analysis indicated that students in the gamified condition and in contexts with a high degree of hypotheticality showed remarkable improvements in scientific knowledge, learning motivation, and argumentation performance. Notably, scientific arguments typically considered challenging to construct, such as evidence-based rebuttals and qualifiers, were effectively explored and addressed. Our findings suggest that designing gamified argumentation activities requires careful consideration of the degree of hypotheticality in learning contexts. In practice, attention should be given to arranging appropriate scaffolds and guidance across varying hypotheticality to foster higher-order scientific thinking.},

  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is widely recognized to be among the most essential skills for university graduates to successfully compete in the 21st century global economy; yet, much obscurity remains regarding its practical role in higher education. In fact, there is a need for an accepted educational plan with pedagogical guidelines that university instructors can lean on for integrating CT into subject instruction. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify the instructional design components recommended by instructors and students for promoting CT in higher education academic courses. The study involved ten higher education instructors and 342 undergraduate students in science and engineering. In order to address the research goal, the study followed the grounded theory approach in which the data was analyzed from a qualitative perspective. The data was collected through two research tools: semi-structured interviews and an online survey. The current study identified eight instructional design components for promoting CT. These components include four pedagogical practices: explicit teaching of CT, integration of digital tools, collaborative learning and constructing questions, as well as four modes of engagement: critical engagement with information, comparing approaches to problem-solving, guided inquiry and experimentation and raising doubts and evaluating credibility. The study introduces an adaptive model incorporating CT-enhanced pedagogical practices, for policymakers and instructional designers, to foster CT in science and engineering courses.},

In addition, a particular projection technique is introduced and analyzed in a coupling and mixed finite element form to assist in proving the optimal convergence properties. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate all theoretical results. The developed numerical method provides a guide to solve physical vibration problems of beams and thin plates, which own the form of nonlinear fourth-order wave equations, stably and accurately for a long time in a way that ensures energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Creativity requires both originality and effectiveness. Originality without effectiveness indicates pseudo-creativity, often due to deficits in idea evaluation. Research on the processes underlying pseudo-creativity and authentic creativity is limited. This study operationally identified individuals with pseudo-creative tendencies and compared them with authentically creative individuals using associative thinking tasks related to idea generation, focusing on memory search and semantic memory representations. In Experiment 1, moderation analysis classified participants into three groups based on multiple creativity measurements: authentic creativity, pseudo-creativity, and low creativity (control). These groups completed a goal-directed association task involving animal concept searching. Results showed that pseudo-creativity was associated with reduced clustering and cluster switching, along with more frequent hard switching. Experiment 2 constructed semantic networks for the three groups using free association, revealing that pseudo-creativity group exhibited a de-structured and hyperconnective semantic network. These findings provide the first characterization of the cognitive processes underlying pseudo-creativity. They reveal that pseudo-creativity exhibits looser conceptual boundaries and demonstrates differences from authentic creativity as early as the idea-generation phase. This offers a direct investigation for the theory that creativity requires a balance between the flexibility and rigidity of lexicon structure.},

The proposed estimator, leverages the robustness of correntropy-induced loss, combined with the nuclear norm penalty, to yield robust low-rank estimation. The robustness is controlled by the scale parameter which behaves similarly to the squared loss for small residuals and caps the effect of large residuals. Despite the nonconvex nature of the loss, we prove that the used estimation algorithm still enjoys global convergence and the proposed estimator achieves the best breakdown point of 1/2, and the desired non-asymptotic statistical rate is further derived under some regularity conditions. The theoretical results also indicate that the estimated rank is of the same order as the unknown true rank. Furthermore, we develop the adaptive nuclear norm (ANN) regularized estimator to better estimate the true rank. The global convergence of its estimation algorithm is also maintained though the objective function is entirely nonconvex. We derive the statistical rate for the ANN counterpart, and the theoretical results show that the estimated rank by ANN is closer to the true rank. Superior performance of the method proposed is demonstrated on both simulations and real-data analysis.},

A personal socio-demographic data sheet, the Creative Imagination Test for Adults (PIC-A), and the Personal Creativity Barrier Inventory were used. We carried out non-parametric analysis, the results of which show that students with higher grades obtain better scores in the narrative and general creative test in both groups, while those who participate in artistic activities achieve better results. No creative barriers were detected in either group. In our conclusion, we underline the importance that participation in artistic activities and academic performance seem to have in these students’ creative development.

We take into account the saturated treatment function while forming the model, incorporating three controls: awareness control, treatment control, and insecticide control. The intricate dynamics of the system, encompassing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as their biological feasibility, are thoroughly examined. The threshold parameter of the system, known as the basic reproduction number, is derived, along with the conditions for the occurrence of backward bifurcation and transcritical bifurcation. We also acquired the equilibria and their stability in relation to variations in the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both backward and transcritical bifurcations can be influenced simply by adjusting the cure rate efficiency and the potency of insecticide controls, which remain within our sphere of control. The analytical result is verified through some numerical work. Finally, we apply the genetic algorithm optimization technique, which is independent of the initial state of the population, to minimize the basic reproduction number by optimizing three control parameters and the cure rate. Optimizing the control parameters and cure rate, we have deduced that the disease will die out in the case of transcritical bifurcation, but it will remain in the population in an equilibrium state for the backward bifurcation.},

The ETD-based explicit multi-step temporal discretization is combined with the Fourier collocation spectral approximation in the numerical design, and a third-order stabilizing term is added to ensure energy stability.

  abstract = {We investigate feedback stabilization of linear high-order systems. Using a block matrix expression of the fundamental matrix, stability criteria of the systems are derived. We also present the Fourier transform formulas of the first row in the block matrix expression of the fundamental matrix. Based on the stability criteria and the Fourier transform formulas of the first row, a frequency-domain method is presented to design a stabilizing controller of the systems. We emphasize that all the computations in this paper involve only matrices with lower size. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results.},

  abstract = {We initiate the study of computational complexity of graph coverings, aka locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for graphs with semi-edges. The notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of local computations. In 1991, Abello, Fellows, and Stillwell asked for a classification of the computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges. Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering graph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem considerably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex mapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge mapping as well. We show some solvable cases and, in particular, completely characterize the complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs, even for bipartite ones. We remark that our new characterization results also strengthen previously known results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and they in turn apply to an infinite class of simple target graphs with at most two vertices of degree more than two. Some of the results are moreover proven in a more general setting (e.g., finding k-tuples of pairwise disjoint perfect matchings in regular graphs).},

  abstract = {The integration of 21st-century skills, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity (the 4Cs) is pivotal in contemporary higher education to prepare students for a rapidly evolving global landscape. Despite widespread theoretical emphasis, empirical insights into how these competencies are implemented in Vietnamese universities remain limited. This study aims to explore the extent of 4Cs integration in Vietnamese higher education and to identify lecturers' opinions on the instructional strategies used and the barriers encountered. To address this aim, a cross-sectional quantitative study using an adapted, validated survey was distributed electronically across multiple institutions in four major Vietnamese cities, employing a multi-stage institutional sampling approach. A total of 140 valid lecturer responses met the inclusion criteria, reflecting the accessible population during the data collection window. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviations) and internal-consistency estimates in SPSS 26. Descriptive analyses indicate widespread integration of the 4Cs, with lecturers most consistently employing structured collaboration and creativity strategies (e.g., group activities and granting student autonomy in resource selection). Conversely, project-based learning, collaborative online tasks, and the use of graphic organizers were reported as less consistently applied. Patterned differences across strategies highlight instructional and institutional barriers, including inadequate technological infrastructure, rigid curricula, and limited professional development opportunities. The results extend the existing literature by providing context-specific evidence on practice patterns and constraints, emphasizing the need for targeted institutional support to enable comprehensive implementation of the 4Cs. Implications include policy measures to enhance infrastructure, greater curriculum flexibility, and sustained professional learning to strengthen lecturers' capacity to embed 21st-century skills in teaching and learning.},

  abstract = {System dynamics provides a valuable framework for analyzing the complexities of a system over time. Using causal loop diagrams (CLDs), this study identifies two feedback mechanisms in the context of integrating computational thinking (CT) into education, focusing on leverage points such as coding-centric curricula and teacher competence development. The modeling shows how reinforcing and balancing feedback loops shape system behavior, demonstrating that interventions like coding-based approaches can deliver immediate benefits but risk hindering the long-term development of broader CT skills applicable to interdisciplinary problem-solving. The study enhances the analysis by uncovering patterns emerging from system dynamics, including the constraints limiting growth, reliance on symptomatic solutions, unintended consequences of quick fixes, and the prioritization of successful areas at the expense of others. These patterns highlight the importance of addressing foundational issues, such as teacher training and comprehensive curriculum design, to avoid overshadowing other critical goals of CT applications in interdisciplinary fields. By synthesizing CLDs, the study showcases the circular interactions between variables and the diverse dynamics influencing CT education, offering insights into potential scenarios and storylines for integrating CT into education systems.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a closed-loop symplectic regularized algorithm for constrained time-varying optimal control problems. Due to the limitations of symplectic methods in constrained time-varying systems, the optimal control problem is transformed and discretized into a discretized symplectic Runge–Kutta form by using variational integrator. Moreover, we derive first-order necessary conditions for the discrete optimal control problem and obtain a set of Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations. To solve the EL equations, we provide a forward–backward sweep iteration algorithm and analyze its error estimation along with regularization terms. Based on this iteration algorithm, a closed-loop symplectic regularized algorithm is proposed consisting of symplectic update and regularized iteration. To be specific, a sequence of quadratic programmings are leveraged in the forward stage of symplectic update to provide good initial values for the regularized iteration. Furthermore, an interior-point barrier function is applied to handle the constraints in the regularized iteration. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided, and simulations are conducted to verify its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the numerical performance of the parallel-in-time contour integral method for one-dimensional differential equations of convection–diffusion type. The considered method is based on the representation of a Dunford-Cauchy integral along a contour which encompasses the spectrum of an unbounded infinitesimal operator A corresponding to the equation. The discrete operator is constructed as a Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) discretization of diffusion and advective, resp. convective, terms. Its accuracy and performance as a part of the contour integration method is compared with those by finite difference approaches. A contour is chosen to be of elliptic shape with varying number of cubature points. Numerical performance of the contour integral method is compared with sequential-in-time realizations of the θ -scheme where discrete operators have similar discretizations by finite differences. The studied algorithm is 2 N time N cub parallelizable, where N time is the number of time points at which the numerical solution is computed and N cub is the number of cubature points on the contour. Its efficiency, however, strongly depends on the performance of the linear solver used for the resolvent part at each cubature point on the contour. In this work, we thoroughly examine the selection of a linear solver and analyze its performance with respect to various problem parameters. The proposed method is flexible in the choice of discretization techniques in space and can be readily extended to multiple dimensions.},

  abstract = {The synchronization research in time-varying networks serves as the foundation for further discussion of information transmission and node consensus. Moreover, changing topology and connection mode in a dynamic network, the time scale of opinion evolution, and an uncertain dynamic chaotic environment such as random noise and time delay are all important factors affecting individual opinion synchronization. Motivated by this observation, a multi-layer time-varying network model is built on the basis of complex multi-layer network, which can better capture the dynamic changes and evolutionary processes of real-world networks. At the same time, time delay of real system and multi-chaotic system are added in order to more realistically simulate the nonlinearity and complexity of social dynamic network systems. On the premise that the change rate of network topology is greater than the synchronization rate of nodes, network controllers and updating rules derived in this paper can effectively realize adaptive synchronization of multi-layer time-varying networks under a single chaotic system and a multi-chaotic system, respectively. These findings shed new light on the evolution of opinions on time-varying complex networks and help decision-makers predict the prevalence of hot topics and public opinions.},

  abstract = {The pervasive impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on society underscores the critical need for comprehensive AI education, particularly for young students. This study investigates how design fiction pedagogy (DFP) may enhance K-12 AI education by fostering understanding of AI and encouraging critical thinking about its social impact. Grounded in constructivist and constructionist theories, DFP integrates speculative design and narrative learning to provide an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. The DFP model, which consists of seven pedagogical steps—researching a problem, designing a prototype, creating a future context, building a narrative, sharing with stakeholders, reflecting on ethical considerations, and evaluating and redesigning—was implemented through two separate week-long AI education camps in Ontario, Canada. Using a qualitative case study approach, we examined how DFP supports upper elementary students in grasping AI concepts and AI’s social impact. The findings indicate that, by integrating technical principles, ethical considerations, and futuristic thinking about human-AI interactions, DFP helps students develop a deeper understanding of AI while fostering creativity, critical thinking, and futuristic thinking—skills essential for the responsible development and use of AI. Consequently, DFP emerges as a promising approach for an AI education that integrates technical knowledge with ethical considerations.},

However, the factors shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward GenAI in creative collaboration have received limited attention, particularly in cross-cultural contexts. To address these gaps, this study has developed and validated an integrated theoretical framework via a hybrid multistage approach. First, focus group interviews (N = 15) informed the extension of the TAM-TPB model by incorporating perceived risk, openness to experience, and AI literacy. Then, cross-cultural survey data from China (N = 529) and the USA (N = 544) were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), multi-group analysis (MGA), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Results showed that subjective norm influenced user attitudes in both countries. In China, perceived usefulness and risk were key predictors, whereas in the USA, ease of use and openness to experience were more influential. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were found to be critical determinants of behavioral intentions across both groups. By integrating perspectives from creativity research, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for the adoption of GenAI in creative domains, informing educators, industry practitioners, and technology developers.},

Empirical results suggest that, in certain scenarios, the test outperforms existing specification tests by achieving a higher power and thereby offering greater sensitivity to deviations from the assumed parametric distribution family. Notably, the proposed test does not involve any hyperparameters and can easily be applied to individual datasets using the gofreg-package in R.},

This kind of preconditioner is defined as a two-level hybrid form, which falls into the class of “unsymmetrically weighted” Schwarz method based on the overlapping domain decomposition with impedance boundary subproblems. The coarse space in this preconditioner is constructed by specific eigenfunctions solving a series of generalized eigenvalue problems in the local discrete Maxwell-harmonic spaces according to a user-defined tolerance

  abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in many real-world applications is selecting a limited number of representative points (RPs) that retain as much valuable information as possible from large datasets or continuous functions. Space-filling RPs (SFRPs) are commonly used to ensure comprehensive coverage of the input domain. However, in practical settings, it is equally important to achieve a well-distributed representation in both the input and response (output) spaces. This paper explores the advantages of input-output space-filling RPs (IOSFRPs), which are designed to ensure coverage across both domains. IOSFRPs are employed in three primary contexts: (i) Clustering, where they serve as cluster centers that promote well-distributed clusters across the input–response space; (ii) Modeling, where they act as experimental designs that capture variability in both domains, thereby improving the accuracy of surrogate models; and (iii) Estimation, where they function as efficient samples or discrete approximations of continuous distributions to enhance statistical inference. Extensive simulations and comparative evaluations demonstrate that IOSFRPs outperform widely used existing methods across all three applications. These findings highlight the flexibility, robustness, and efficiency of the IOSFRPs. Importantly, the weighting parameter allows for tuning the balance between input and output space-filling properties, enabling the IOSFRPs to adapt to a wide range of data-driven applications.},

We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate the spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the numerical spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.},

Specifically, we compared the performance of expert (more than three years) and novice (less than four months) design students when reading different layout configurations of a product design plan. A total of 80 participants, 40 experts and 40 novices, were recruited from a Chinese university. Using a 2 (expertise: expert vs. novice) × 2 (layout: text-image proximity vs. text-image separation) experimental design, participants' recall, insight scores, visual attention distribution and visual attention transition were analyzed. Eye-tracking data revealed that experts allocated significantly more visual attention to images and exhibited more complex fixation transitions between images and texts, suggesting higher levels of critical engagement. In contrast, novices displayed a more linear reading pattern, particularly in layouts that separated images from texts. Correspondingly, experts outperformed novices in both recall and insight scores. Additionally, layout configurations had a more complex impact on visual attention and performance. In the second layout, fixation time on images showed a positive correlation with insight, and experts exhibited fixation transitions between images. The results provide valuable insights for design educators, emphasizing the need for tailored instructional strategies to foster critical thinking skills in students at different educational levels.},

This paper presents a browning model based on Maillard reaction kinetics that integrates into comprehensive CFD baking models, predicting melanoidin concentration and food browning during baking. Initial validation uses data from established studies on the Maillard reaction and melanoidin formation in simplified model systems (sugar–amino acid mixtures heated under controlled conditions). Further experimental validation involves baking muffins in a domestic oven, comparing observed surface browning and melanoidin absorption with the model’s simulated browning index and melanoidins over time. A method for calculating the browning index from experiments and CFD simulations is presented. Validation shows differences in melanoidin concentration and browning index between measurements and simulations below 8% and 7%, respectively, across all baking times. This research provides insight into the mechanisms of browning reactions in baked goods, enabling the integration of Maillard reaction kinetics into CFD models. These findings offer practical tools for predicting browning, allowing the food industry to optimise baking processes, improve product consistency, and enhance safety and quality.},

To address this, we applied a conjecture-based framework to systematically review 45 empirical studies published between 2010 and 2022, focusing on how specific task designs and CPS processes contribute to HOTS. We used a machine learning tool to prioritize relevant studies and streamline the selection process, ending after a threshold number of consecutive irrelevant articles. Guided by the conjecture-based framework, our analysis highlighted how cognitive processes in CPS function as essential mechanisms of learning and measurable outcomes. Specifically, design features, such as technology-supported exploratory tasks and open-ended problems, encourage reflective discourse and deeper cognitive engagement. We also found that structured group procedures, including clear roles and guided interaction protocols, improve collaboration. Nonetheless, challenges like miscommunication and uneven participation can limit CPS from fully realizing its potential to cultivate HOTS. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of aligning task design with CPS processes and using strategies to address collaboration barriers, particularly those related to communication. Without clear protocols and consistent dialogue, even well-designed CPS tasks can fail to cultivate HOTS. In conclusion, this review offers practical insights for educators and researchers implementing CPS effectively in mathematics education, highlighting that fostering open, structured communication is vital for optimizing both collaborative processes and the development of advanced cognitive skills.},

  abstract = {Creative problem-solving has been highly acknowledged as an important skill for students in the 21st century. While risk-taking tendency has been identified as an important factor for creative problem-solving performance, empirical findings regarding their relationships remain inconsistent – partly due to variations in conceptualizing and measuring creativity, as well as a general lack of consideration for contextual moderators. Drawing on Trait Activation Theory (TAT), the present study takes a tentative and exploratory approach to examining how perceived teacher support for creativity moderates the relationships between risk-taking tendency and four subskills of creative problem-solving (problem identification, information processing, idea generation, idea evaluation) among Chinese fourth graders. Using a computer-based interactive assessment to objectively measure the subskills, data from 1544 students suggested that risk-taking tendency positively predicted overall creative problem-solving performance. Furthermore, perceived teacher support appeared to play a moderating role, though this was observed primarily in the dimensions of idea generation and idea evaluation. The findings offer preliminary insights into how contextual factors may shape trait expression in creative processes, with implications for educators and parents to better support student creativity development.},

The low-order variant is provably stable and mass conservative; the high-order variant is at least second-order accurate in both space and time, well-defined, and mass-conservative.

The poroelastic media is governed by the quasi-static Biot model, and the fluid flow in the fracture is governed by the reduced dimensional Darcy model. The two models are fully coupled by four interface conditions. A spatial discretization is constructed by combining different methods, the polyhedral weighted discontinuous Galerkin method for the quasi-static Biot model, and the continuous Galerkin finite element method for the reduced dimensional fracture model. We prove the existence and uniqueness, stability, a priori error estimates for the solution of semidiscrete and fully discrete formulation with the backward Euler scheme. Through numerical experiments, we verify the convergence order of the numerical method, design a comparative case to validate the model, test the robustness of the numerical method in solving the Biot–Darcy model with different permeability coefficients, fracture morphologies, and curved fracture, simulate hydraulic fracturing. The results demonstrate that the model we have investigated is valid, and our numerical method is robust enough to accurately simulate the coupling of geomechanics and fluid flow in fracture poroelastic media.},

  abstract = {Equipping English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) learners with critical thinking (CT) skills offers significant benefits for both their academic advancement and future careers. Due to its pivotal role in learners' lives, the pursuit of more effective interventions for developing CT skills among EFL learners remains ongoing. This study aims to examine how CT skills are fostered among EFL learners in higher education, as evidenced in published research. To achieve this, a secondary research method using the PRISMA systematic review framework was employed. The review systematically analyzed 47 published research articles selected from an initial search of 11,143 titles across eight online databases. The findings of the review are as follows. First, fostering CT skills in higher education has become a major concern among EFL educators and researchers in Asia. Second, the review highlights that both immersion and infusion approaches can effectively promote CT development, particularly when used in combination. Key strategies such as self-learning, discussion, and mentoring are central to these approaches, with a strong emphasis on collaborative learning and reflective practices. The duration of interventions plays a critical role: longer and more sustained programs tend to produce stronger outcomes. Additionally, the learning environment—whether traditional, web-based, or blended—impacts the effectiveness of CT interventions. Among these, blended learning consistently yields favorable results, suggesting that integrating in-class and online instruction is highly recommended. Finally, methodological factors generally enhance the outcomes of CT instruction. In contrast, personal factors (i.e., learner-related variables) can both support and hinder the development of CT skills, depending on context. Therefore, these factors may act as either enablers or inhibitors of CT skill acquisition under different conditions. This review proposes several educational implications to improve the cultivation of CT skills among EFL learners in higher education, focusing on instructional strategies, assessment methods, and learning resources.},

  abstract = {In recent times, the artificial intelligence (AI) based deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted much attention from researchers. The aforesaid tools provide best solutions in many real world applications. On the other hand, combining the aforementioned tools with the traditional and fractional calculus tools, significant results can be created for comprehensive analysis of many problems of real world phenomenon and engineering disciplines. Systems of differential equations play important roles in modeling various real world problems involving ordinary or fractional order derivatives. Keeping the mentioned importance in minds, this paper investigates a coupled system of fractional integro-differential equations for qualitative and computational analysis. Utilizing the well known conformable fractional derivative, sufficient results are developed to analyze the solution of the system for existence and uniqueness. The fixed point concepts are utilized to advances to the desired results. Stability results are deduced by using the concept of Ulam–Hyers. At the last section the numerical aspect are investigated of the problem by using RK-4 (Runge–Kutta of order four) method under the mentioned fractional derivative. Also, the mentioned DNNs techniques have used to analysis the considered problems from AI perspectives. To demonstrate our adopted results, some important real world examples are presented at the end. The Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm is used for classifications of various results including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), regression coefficient by taking a specified numbers of neuron and epoches. Various graphical illustrations for training, testing, validation and all data are presented.},

Additionally, a Lyapunov iterative method is explored as an alternative to circumvent complex mathematical derivations. The proposed methods significantly reduce computational complexity by enabling low-dimensional computations for each follower, contrasting with the high-dimensional computations required by previous approaches. To prevent divergence of the norm of the solution, even with a small number of followers, we introduce a new condition for the coefficient matrices of the original mean-field stochastic system and develop an incentive strategy to ensure a finite norm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and reliability of our algorithm by solving a large-scale set of SNMEs and confirming the linear convergence of the simplified Newton’s method.},

Indeed, enablers of creativity represent a dominant field in this regard. Based on “Confluence approaches”, the study chose 14,041 fourth graders from 309 primary schools from a city in the Central Region of China, all of which completed online questionnaires that looked into the individual enablers and social enablers of creativity in science. Results of the descriptive analysis of individual enablers showed that there was a decrease observed in students’ attitude toward science, interest in science, engagement in science learning, and career orientation toward science. While the LASSO and nomogram results indicated six common variables of social enablers including teachers’ concerns about students’ interests, individualized teaching, collaborative group teaching, the infrastructure of science, after-school service in science subjects, and parent engagement in daily life. These variables consistently emerged as pivotal when predicting the correlation between social and individual enablers of creativity in science. Teaching methods (individualized teaching, collaborative group teaching) were identified as the most influential social enablers on individual enablers of creativity in science. These findings provide valuable insight into what teachers, schools, and families should concentrate on to effectively support the expression and enhancement of student creativity in science.},

This is a basic notion characterizing the thinking of Heinz Werner, who already in 1937 discussed the preoccupation with product at the expense of process as a basic problem for research and theory. In this paper, the type of process that Werner is referring to is addressed. Two test cases are presented: that of metaphor comprehension, and that of metaphor production which, itself, is a prime example of creative thinking. The focus of the discussion of metaphor production is on the stages of incubation and illumination/insight. The use of a microgenetic procedure, via which metaphor production (creative thinking) is investigated in real time, focusing on ongoing experience while producing a metaphor, is promoted here.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that social exclusion enhances the retaliatory malevolent creativity of the excluded. However, its influence on the retaliatory malevolent creativity of bystanders, another key group in social exclusion, remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to investigate how social exclusion, particularly when coupled with attacks from excluders or the excluded, shapes bystanders’ retaliatory malevolent creativity. Study 1 and Study 2 recruited 69 and 74 participants, respectively. In both studies, participants were randomly assigned into the social exclusion group or control group. The social exclusion group underwent two blocks of social exclusion manipulation, while the control group experienced two blocks of sham exclusion manipulation. Following each manipulation, participants completed a retaliatory malevolent creative ideation task (MCT) targeting the excluded in Study 1 and excluder in Study 2. Study 1 showed that, only in the second block, the exclusion group exhibited higher MCT performance (fluency, originality, and malevolence) targeting the excluded than the control group. In study 2, the excluded group demonstrated significantly higher MCT performance targeting excluder exclusively in the first block than the control group. This exclusion effect on bystander’s retaliatory malevolent creativity was not mediated by the bystander’s sympathy or aggression. These findings indicate that simply witnessing social exclusion may increase bystanders’ retaliatory malevolent creativity toward both excluder and the excluded. Notably, the timing of this effect varies depending on the target of the MCT task, and its underlying mechanisms may involve factors other than aggression or empathy such as moral disengagement.},

  abstract = {This study explores the nonlinear hemodynamics of ternary hybrid nanoparticles (THNPs) in a diverging, ciliated microtube, accounting for interfacial nanolayer effects, electromagnetic forces, and cilia-driven propulsion. A fractional second-grade fluid model captures memory-dependent viscoelastic behavior. The governing nonlinear equations are analytically solved via the Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM), yielding rapidly converging series solutions. Results show that the fractional parameter enhances axial velocity, while relaxation time impedes flow near the tube center. Lorentz forces boost flow rates, whereas Hall and ion-slip currents exert a dampening effect. Meanwhile, nanolayer interactions intensify wall shear stress but hinder thermal efficiency by reducing heat transfer. A comprehensive dataset derived from the HPM solution was used to train, test, and validate an artificial neural network using the Backpropagation Levenberg–Marquardt scheme (ANN-BPLMS), achieving high predictive accuracy (99.99% testing, 99.996% cross-validation). These insights have significant implications for magnetically guided drug delivery, artificial cilia systems, and nanoscale biomedical transport. By integrating fractional dynamics, electrokinetics, and interfacial physics, this work advances the modeling of complex physiological microflows.},

The framework dynamically integrates specialized agents, enabling the generation of summaries that excel in coherence, factual accuracy, and brevity. Evaluated on a dataset of 10 educational scenarios encompassing human-written narratives and AI-generated summaries, the MoA framework demonstrated a 15 % improvement in narrative coherence and a 12 % gain in factual accuracy compared to 20 state-of-the-art summarization models.
                  The framework’s educational application was tested through comparative analysis of human- and AI-generated summaries in both 50-word and 15-word formats. Results highlight that while AI-generated summaries excel in factual consistency, human summaries retain greater creativity and narrative depth. By iteratively refining outputs, the MoA framework approaches human-level performance in long-form summarization tasks, bridging the gap between human and AI capabilities.
                  This study contributes to text summarization research by introducing an adaptive multi-agent framework, conducting an in-depth analysis of humanAI differences in summarization, and demonstrating the potential of AIdriven tools to enhance creative writing and learning in educational settings.},

A parametric system emerged from an application of stochastic Galerkin approach is discretized by using symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method with upwinding for the convection term in the spatial domain. We derive a residual-based error estimator contributed by the error due to the SIPG discretization, the (generalized) polynomial chaos discretization in the stochastic space, and data oscillations. Then, the reliability of the proposed error estimator, an upper bound for the energy error up to a multiplicative constant, is shown. Moreover, to balance the errors stemmed from spatial and stochastic spaces, the truncation error emerged from Karhunen–Loève expansion is considered in the numerical simulations. Last, several benchmark examples including a random diffusivity parameter, a random convectivity parameter, random diffusivity/convectivity parameters, and a random (jump) discontinuous diffusivity parameter, are tested to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator.},

  abstract = {Considering environmental factors and global warming, the use and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems have become widespread. However, the integration of these PV systems into smart grids raises concerns regarding cybersecurity. Since PV systems rely on communication networks, remote monitoring, and grid-connected inverters, they exhibit a cyber–physical structure and are therefore vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyber threats targeting PV infrastructure can lead to system failures, energy theft, grid instability, and financial losses. While many studies focus on cyber-attack detection for PV system cybersecurity, this paper aims to design a cybersecure PV system by employing a novel chaos-based encryption method. Due to their unpredictable and highly sensitive nature, chaotic algorithms are utilized to ensure secure communication within PV systems. The encryption algorithm is derived from the incommensurate fractional analysis of the “strings around the Bardeen-AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence dark energy”, a cosmological system. Simulation results performed in MATLAB/Simulink confirm the effectiveness of the proposed encryption framework. The underlying pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) successfully passed all 15 standard NIST SP800-22 statistical tests, validating its strong statistical randomness and unpredictability. Furthermore, the encrypted signals consistently exhibit high information entropy (e.g.,

                      encrypted entropy = 5.3213 compared to actual entropy = 4.0931), indicating strong randomization and obscurity of original patterns.

  abstract = {Causal inference is a crucial framework in a variety of fields, such as economics, healthcare, and social science. In this context, data-driven machine learning models have become more popular for estimating the effects of treatments. One fundamental technique for causal inference is structural equation modeling (SEM), which makes it possible to estimate the relationships between variables. However, conventional SEM methods need help with the complexities of structural causal models (SCM) in real-world data, including latent confounders, nonlinear relationships, and challenges in accurately specifying model structures. These limitations could cause the interpretation or biased causal effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new proposed method combining the piecewise structural equation modeling (PSEM) with the backdoor criterion, named PSEMBC. The main innovation of PSEMBC is the estimation of causal effects with the use of a linear SCM model, which captures complex relationships and interactions in the data. We demonstrate the value of PSEMBC for precisely and reliably identifying the average treatment effect (ATE) in simulated and real-world datasets utilizing a comparative study with current causal inference approaches.},

  abstract = {Despite the considerable funding of open schooling projects from the EU, relevant publications have been scarce. We present an analysis of open schooling initiatives launched within the frame of the STE(A)M Learning Ecologies – SLEs Project. SLEs offer opportunities to promote creativity of both learners and stakeholders engaged through innovative pedagogical design and the delivery of original learning artefacts (learning products). We gathered and analyzed several forms of data reflecting learner and stakeholder engagement associated with these initiatives. They included two templates completed with stakeholder input (participatory pedagogical design template; participatory scenario development template), learning products delivered by students in each SLE, interviews with stakeholders and responses to open-ended questionnaire items. Our data analysis revealed four types of SLEs: (1) Learner-experience oriented, (2) Master-product oriented, (3) End-user oriented, and (4) Citizen-science oriented.
                  We present similarities and differences of the various types of SLE with regard to stakeholder synthesis (diversity), learning objectives, female participation, career opportunities, their potential for transformative change, challenges encountered, and sustainability aspects. Based on the typology of SLEs and their characteristics, we identified a series of recommendations for future research and policy to optimize investment in and impact of open schooling projects. These include a focus on small wins to scale up SLEs, distributed leadership to empower teachers and increase availability of learning resources and learner support, and using learning products to decentralize formative assessment in SLEs and promote constructive stakeholder dialogue.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the pricing problem of vulnerable options. We consider the default risk of these options, and assume that the dynamic evolution of the underlying asset price and its instantaneous variance can be described by an affine model that incorporates stochastic volatility with simultaneous jumps. The default intensity and risk-free interest rate are assumed to be random and satisfy the CIR model. An analytical formula for the option price is derived using Fourier transform techniques. Based on this pricing formula, some models for the price of the underlying asset of option and for the default intensity of the option seller are calibrated and the model parameters are estimated. The implied volatilities corresponding to the theoretical prices of the option derived from the models are calculated and compared with the implied volatilities calculated from the option market prices.},

The study was conducted with the participation of 125 (60: girls, 65: boys) elementary school students aged 9–10 in Düzce, Türkiye, in the 2024–2025 academic year. The study's hypotheses were analyzed and interpreted using the Process Macro program (for SPSS) developed by Hayes. The moderator variable effect of representational fluency was tested with Model 1, the moderator effect of the sub-dimensions of representational fluency was tested with Model 2, and the moderating effect of gender on the moderator variable was tested with Model 3. The study results show that representational fluency has a moderating role in the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. In addition, it was determined that this effect was not significant at different levels of representational fluency. However, only high representational fluency positively regulated the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. It was concluded that the "connection" dimension came to the fore in the moderating effect of representational fluency. Gender was a moderator variable affecting the moderating effect of representational fluency on the effect of mental imagery on scientific creativity. Theoretical explanations and implications related to the research results were shared.},

Next, we introduce the sub-mixed fractional GBM model as a better tool for stock price prediction. We then propose two investment strategies to reduce unsystematic risk, based on the investor’s wealth. The first strategy uses a mixed hedging approach, allowing investors to hedge their full position with the contract funds, leading to the European option price. The second strategy lets investors hedge only part of their risk, depending on their risk tolerance.},

In order to increase the speed of the algorithm, a new retraction method was introduced based on the real Schur decomposition. The algorithm was tested using the cost function, both parametric (mutual information approximation) and semi-parametric (kernel method). The simulations showed a significant increase in the speed of the ICA algorithm, which indicates the practical usage potential of this method in on-line applications.},

  abstract = {Random number generators are extensively used in science. Generating pseudo-random numbers is the base for many data analysis techniques in computational statistics. This is the case, for instance, of most of the Bayesian methods, which are enabled by means of samplers such as the well-known Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis–Hastings. These classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers are designed to generate a sequence of numbers that, under certain conditions, converge to a sequence that behaves as if sampled from a user-defined target distribution. In general, the number of iterations required to reach such convergence is not deterministic. There are several statistical tests for identifying that convergence has not yet been achieved, but not for actually signaling convergence. The present work introduces an exact non-parametric sequential test for signaling the convergence of random number generators in general. The solution is derived in the light of the type I error probability spending approach.},

This method exhibits a spectral-like accuracy, with the free functions involved in the FCE form represented by polynomial bases or by non-polynomial bases of quasi-random sinusoidal functions. The FCE method offers a special advantage over traditional element-based methods for boundary value problems involving relative boundary conditions. A number of linear and nonlinear numerical examples in one and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the performance of the FCE method developed herein.},

Using a longitudinal design with formative and summative assessments, the study employed single and chain mediation models to analyze HOTSs development during a 9-session biological science course on photosynthesis, respiration and the food chain. The results revealed that S-HOTS indirectly promote C–HOTS through sequential mediation pathways, with stronger effects from chain mediators compared to direct effects. Notably, model construction and systematic thinking skills emerged as pivotal mediators, bridging early-developing HOTSs and later-developing HOTSs. These findings highlighted the importance of stepwise instructional strategies aligned with hierarchical skill evolution, offering empirical insights for designing curricula that foster the development of HOTSs in science education.},

Moreover, we establish the global convergence and convergence rate of the algorithm under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property. In addition, some numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the new method.},

In this paper, we introduce a dual–primal version of the newly developed PC-PDHG algorithm and extend its applicability to general bilinear saddle point problems, resulting in the generalized new prediction–correction dual–primal hybrid gradient (GNPC-DPHG) algorithm. In many instances, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations compared to the original algorithm, while only adding a small amount of computational cost per iteration, thereby enhancing the convergence rate. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous proof of the global convergence of the proposed GNPC-DPHG algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence compared to the original algorithm.},

The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the scattering problems considered as boundary value problems and present the result of the well-posedness of each boundary value problem by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop a Nyström method for numerically solving the boundary value problems considered, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nyström method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the convergence results of the Nyström method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nyström method.},

  abstract = {Histopolation, or interpolation on segments, is a mathematical technique used to approximate a function f over a given interval I = [ a , b ] by exploiting integral information over a set of subintervals of I . Unlike classical polynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations, histopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to classical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known Runge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced nodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous functions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict requirement of passing through all the given data points. This inherent flexibility can reduce the likelihood of oscillatory behavior using, for example, rational approximation operators. In this work, we introduce a C ∞ rational quasi-histopolation operator, for bounded (integrable) functions, which reconstruct a function by defeating both the Runge and Gibbs phenomena. A key element of our approach is to blend local histopolation polynomials on a few nodes using multinode Shepard functions as blending functions. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our method.},

In fact, for showing the quality of the numerical anti-reflective BCs, we compare various types of numerical BCs, including the anti-symmetric ones considered in the case of fractional differential problems for modeling reasons. More in detail, given important similarities between anti-symmetric and anti-reflective BCs, we compare them from the perspective of computational efficiency, by considering nontruncated and truncated versions, and also other standard numerical BCs such as periodic BCs or reflective/Neumann BCs. A short theoretical analysis and several numerical tests, tables, and visualizations are provided and critically discussed. The conclusion is that the truncated numerical anti-reflective BCs perform better, both in terms of low computational cost and accuracy.},

                  This study examined learning processes in the context of a Capstone program for undergraduate seniors enrolled in a health sciences-focused university. During their Capstone, students design a personalized final-year curriculum, engage in structured reflection, and publicly present their learning. Applying the curricular space model (Blasco, 2016) which incorporates the Japanese notion of ma, an intentional gap that facilitates learning, we explored the impact of the interplay between three curricular spaces (cognitive, autonomy, and reflection) on innovative and creative thinking in Capstone final presentations.
               
                  Method
                  Using reflexive thematic analysis and content analysis, we analyzed 74 presentation videos (15 % of Capstone presentations from 2017–2022), including 42 distinguished presentations and 32 randomly selected ones.
               
                  Results
                  Student presentations revealed six themes that shed light on the impact of curricular space on learning: (1) Humorous presentation of challenges, (2) Empathetic storytelling, (3) Pre- and post-capstone, (4) Truth statement, (5) Detailed critical incident, and (6) Acknowledgement as a mode of reflection. Content analysis revealed that three codes (“Unordinary,” “Vulnerability,” and “Sensory”) were highly connected to most other codes, highlighting these as centrally important learning phenomena, and further identified especially strong links between “Vulnerability” and “Authenticity.” No significant differences were identified between the distinguished and non-distinguished Capstone presentations.
               
                  Discussion
                  Our analysis revealed that personal growth and identity development were key learning outcomes in the Capstone presentations, which emerged through prioritizing reflective and imaginative spaces and expressed through creative, authentic self-representation.},

Grounded in the AIR model of epistemic thinking, the program focused on supporting teachers in promoting students’ evaluation Aims, evaluation Ideals (criteria), and Reliable evaluation processes (strategies) across the regular curriculum. Teachers collaboratively learned, designed, and taught evaluation activities that were intended to foster these elements. We report on the program’s initial implementation with seven junior high school teachers and their students (N = 118), who were assigned to intervention and control groups. Using a mixed-method design, we administered assessments of information source evaluation to teachers and students before and after the intervention. Qualitative data sources included teacher interviews, teacher reflections, classroom observations, and PD meeting transcripts. Following the PD, teachers’ critical evaluation competencies became more elaborate and explicit. All of the teachers integrated information source evaluation in their instruction and adapted or designed evaluation activities that were tailored to their disciplines. Teachers faced challenges related to the complexities of integrating evaluation instruction in disciplinary topics, metacognitive instruction, and curriculum structure. Following the PD, students increasingly used source evaluation criteria, but there were no changes in their evaluation strategies. These results demonstrate the potential of the PD model and identify challenges that may inform future PD initiatives.},

This study investigated how two components of inhibitory control—conflict detection and conflict inhibition—contribute to remote associative thinking under different types of experience constraints. Participants completed a Chinese Compound Remote Associates Task (CCAT) under three conditions (Non-Constrained, Perceptual-Constrained, and Semantic-Constrained), along with Flanker and Stroop tasks to measure distractor and prepotent response inhibition. Event-related potentials components (N200 and N450) and response time differences were used to assess conflict detection and inhibition, respectively. Both correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of these cognitive control processes on creative performance. The results showed that conflict inhibition consistently facilitated creative performance, while the effect of conflict detection varied across experience conditions: greater sensitivity to semantic conflict shortened response latency, whereas greater sensitivity to perceptual conflict reduced accuracy. These findings suggest that the role of inhibitory control in creativity is context-dependent and highlight the differentiated contributions of detection and inhibition in experience-constrained creative problem-solving.},

While traditional Fourier-based methods have been instrumental, they often struggle to capture the intricate nuances of signals that exhibit non-linearity, non-stationarity, or dual characteristics. To address these limitations, a novel approach namely the Discrete Biquaternion Linear Canonical Transform (DBiQLCT) is introduced in this paper. Because of the inherent non-commutativity of biquaternion algebra multiplication, the Discrete Biquaternion Linear Canonical Transform (DBiQLCT) has three unique forms: left-sided DBiQLCT, right-sided DBiQLCT, and two-sided DBiQLCT. We first introduce a notion of DBiQLCT and subsequently investigate the connections between these transformations. Following that, we investigate the two-sided discrete biquaternion linear canonical transform (TDBiQLCT), revealing important fundamental features such as linearity, time shift, conjugate, and modulation. We also establish the Plancherel and convolution theorems associated with the two-sided DBiQLCT. Furthermore, applications of the proposed transform are discussed at the end.},

  abstract = {To comprehend complex systems with multiple states, it is imperative to reveal the identity of these states by system outputs. Nevertheless, the mathematical models describing these systems often exhibit nonlinearity, making the solution of the parameter inverse problem from observed spatiotemporal data a challenging task. Starting from the observed data obtained from such systems, we propose a novel framework that facilitates the investigation of parameter identification for multi-state systems governed by spatiotemporal varying parametric partial differential equations. Our framework consists of two integral components: a constrained self-adaptive physics-informed neural networks, encompassing a sub-network, and a finite mixture model with Gaussian components, as our methodology for parameter identification and change-point detection. Through our scheme, we can accurately estimate the unknown varying parameters of the complex multi-state system. Furthermore, we have showcased the efficacy of our framework on two numerical cases: the 1D Burgers’ equation with time-varying parameters and the 2D wave equation with a space-varying parameter.},

Within a reduced-form framework, we study an optimal investment problem in the presence of default where the stochastic default intensity is linked to a non-traded state variable that exhibits slow mean-reversion. For an optimal investment objective governed by a constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility function, we derive semi-closed asymptotic solutions to the value function and the indifference prices for defaultable bonds and CDS. We demonstrate that the indifference prices can be interpreted as a perturbation around the prices derived under a constant default intensity framework. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of various risk parameters on the derived prices.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a new fully-mixed finite element method for the coupled model arising from the Navier–Stokes equations, with variable viscosity, in an incompressible fluid, and the Darcy equations in an adjacent porous medium, so that suitable transmission conditions are considered on the corresponding interface. The approach is based on the introduction of the further unknowns in the fluid given by the velocity gradient and the pseudostress tensor, where the latter includes the respective diffusive and convective terms. The above allows the elimination from the system of the fluid pressure, which can be calculated later on via a postprocessing formula. In addition, the traces of the fluid velocity and the Darcy pressure become the Lagrange multipliers enforcing weakly the interface conditions. In this way, the resulting variational formulation is given by a nonlinear perturbation of a threefold saddle point operator equation, where the saddle-point in the middle of them is, in turn, perturbed. A fixed-point strategy along with the generalized Babuška-Brezzi theory, a related abstract result for perturbed saddle-point problems, the Banach-Nečas-Babuška theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem, are employed to prove the well-posedness of the continuous and Galerkin schemes. In particular, Raviart–Thomas and piecewise polynomial subspaces of the lowest degree for the domain unknowns, as well as continuous piecewise linear polynomials for the Lagrange multipliers on the interface, constitute a feasible choice of the finite element subspaces. Optimal error estimates and associated rates of convergence are then established. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the method in 2D and confirming the theoretical findings, are reported.},

They then completed an alternative uses task while receiving one of three feedback types: constructive positive, constructive negative, or no feedback. Creative performance was evaluated based on fluency and originality. Results revealed a significant interaction effect on originality, showing that constructive negative feedback enhanced originality more than constructive positive or no feedback, particularly for children with higher intrinsic motivation. No significant interaction effect was found for fluency. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring feedback strategies to children’s motivational states and suggest that, when thoughtfully delivered, constructive negative feedback can foster originality in highly motivated preschool children. Limitations and future directions are discussed.},

Our qualitative study examines how 101 postgraduate students at an Indian university interact with GenAI tools (ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat, and Perplexity.ai) through contextualized learning experiences in supply chain analytics and manufacturing logistics. Using grounded theory analysis of open-ended interviews, we identified six interconnected themes spanning technological, cognitive and ethical dimensions as a result of students navigating AI-mediated learning environments. Our findings showed that students were able to develop sophisticated “distributed creativity” and "augmented metacognition," enabling them to negotiate complex relationships between AI assistance and intellectual ownership. Rather than passive consumption, students demonstrated emerging AI literacy, whereby they were able to critically evaluate AI output, recognize its limitations while also maintain authorial control. These insights illuminate evidence-based strategies for fostering AI literacy while preserving academic integrity, enabling educators to responsibly harness GenAI's transformative potential.},

However, the study also highlighted significant challenges, including (a) the necessity for teacher readiness to utilize AI, (b) perceived biases against AI, and (c) the need to find a balance between human creativity and AI facilitation in co-creative processes.

  abstract = {This survey presents a focused and conceptually distinct framework for understanding recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to emulate “slow thinking”, a deliberate, analytical mode of cognition analogous to System 2 in dual-process theory from cognitive psychology. While prior review works have surveyed reasoning LLMs through fragmented lenses, such as isolated technical paradigms (e.g., reinforcement learning or test-time scaling) or broad post-training taxonomies, this work uniquely integrates reinforcement learning and test-time scaling as synergistic mechanisms within a unified “slow thinking” paradigm. By synthesizing insights from over 200 studies, we identify three interdependent pillars that collectively enable advanced reasoning: (1) Test-time scaling, which dynamically allocates computational resources based on task complexity via search, adaptive computation, and verification; (2) Reinforcement learning, which refines reasoning trajectories through reward modeling, policy optimization, and self-improvement; and (3) Slow-thinking frameworks, which structure reasoning into stepwise, hierarchical, or hybrid processes such as long Chain-of-Thought and multi-agent deliberation. Unlike existing surveys, our framework is goal-oriented, centering on the cognitive objective of “slow thinking” as both a unifying principle and a design imperative. This perspective enables a systematic analysis of how diverse techniques converge toward human-like deep reasoning. The survey charts a trajectory toward next-generation LLMs that balance cognitive fidelity with computational efficiency, while also outlining key challenges and future directions. Advancing such reasoning capabilities is essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains including scientific discovery, autonomous agents, and complex decision support systems.},

Given the critical role of creativity in engineering and design education, understanding how AI tools shape students’ ideation processes is essential for developing effective pedagogical practices. This study examines the impact of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, on creative ideation among undergraduate design engineering students. The research was conducted through a randomised crossover experiment, with students alternating between AI-assisted and unaided ideation tasks. A mixed-methods approach combined quantitative analyses of the 728 ideas generated with a qualitative evaluation of students’ interactions with AI. Results show that the use of AI did not reduce fluency, flexibility, or originality, nor did it lead to thematic homogenisation. However, semantic divergence was significantly lower in the AI-assisted condition, suggesting convergence in the way ideas were formulated. Additionally, AI-assisted ideas more frequently resembled existing products and exhibited reduced textual elaboration. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA revealed that students who began with AI support produced more original and diverse ideas across both tasks, pointing to a lasting effect of early AI use. Qualitative analysis of student-AI interactions revealed important patterns, including predominantly passive and directive use, with limited exploratory or collaborative engagement. These findings provide new insights into human-AI co-creation and highlight the importance of promoting intentional, critical, and pedagogically guided use of generative AI tools in education.},

Using expert-screened product samples (N = 9) and consumer survey data (N = 545), we employed PLS-SEM to test a second-order formative model. Results show that only Usefulness and Cultural Values significantly predict creativity, while Affect, Novelty, and Aesthetics, despite high internal reliability, exhibit multicollinearity and non-significance. These findings challenge the additive logic of existing formative models and suggest that consumers rely on holistic impressions in evaluating MCCPs. We propose a dual-path evaluative framework that distinguishes between perception-dominant (emotional and aesthetic) and cognition-dominant (functional and cultural) processes, offering both theoretical refinement and practical guidance for assessing MCCPs.},

  abstract = {Modern design education requires innovative approaches to inspire and enhance creativity. Prior research suggests that cognitive stimulation levels significantly influence creative performance, with an optimal level known as the “sweet spot” effect. However, studies specifically addressing inexperienced designers remain limited. While mood boards are commonly used as visual stimuli in design processes, few studies, particularly in educational contexts, have explored the optimal level of stimulation. This gap may stem from challenges such as novice users’ limited expertise and the absence of refined instructional strategies. This controlled experiment aimed to explore whether an optimal level of stimulation exists in mood board design activities. Participants were classified into low-, moderate-, and high-constraint groups based on the degree of image involvement. The study employed the sweet spot framework, treating creativity level as the dependent variable and constraint level as the independent variable. Creativity in design sketches was evaluated across four dimensions: novelty, variety, quality, and quantity. Mood board effectiveness was subjectively assessed using three criteria: innovation, consistency, and visual attractiveness. The results indicated that the moderate-constraint group proved most effective in stimulating creativity across these four metrics. They also required less creation time than the high-constraint group. Moreover, moderately constrained mood boards demonstrated the largest number of significant positive correlations with sketch creativity. Furthermore, the study identified the characteristics of mood boards with low and high constraint levels. Based on these findings, this study proposes practical instructional strategies to foster creative education using mood boards.},

  abstract = {Association analysis of multivariate omics outcomes is challenging due to the high dimensionality and inter-correlation among outcome variables. In practice, the classic multi-univariate analysis approaches are commonly employed, utilizing linear regression models for each individual outcome followed by adjustments for multiplicity through control of the false discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise error rate (FWER). While straightforward, these multi-univariate methods overlook dependencies between outcome variables. This oversight leads to less accurate statistical inferences, characterized by lower power and an increased false discovery rate, ultimately resulting in reduced replicability across studies. Recently, advanced frequentist and Bayesian methods have been developed to account for these dependencies. However, these methods often pose significant computational challenges for researchers in the field. To bridge this gap, a computationally efficient autoregressive multivariate regression model is proposed that explicitly accounts for the dependence structure among outcome variables. Through extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the approach provides more accurate multivariate inferences than traditional methods and remains robust even under model misspecification. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to investigate whether the associations between serum lipidomics outcomes and Alzheimer’s disease differentiate in

The analysis of system inactivity time is particularly important in reliability data analysis, providing valuable insights into system failures and overall performance. This study extends the cumulative past inaccuracy measure to a bivariate framework, addressing prediction errors in bivariate random processes while examining its properties in the absence of a known probability density function. Additionally, we introduce a conditionally weighted extension, the conditional weighted cumulative past inaccuracy measure, and explore its theoretical properties within conditionally specified models. When the probability density function is unknown, we adopt a nonparametric approach using kernel estimation techniques to approximate the measure effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed kernel estimator to ensure its reliability. To demonstrate the practical utility of the estimator, we provide a numerical illustration, showcasing its application in reliability and survival analysis.},

In this study, a pretest-posttest experimental design was employed, which was implemented over three months. The participants were split into control and experiment groups. The experimental group performed SAC tasks via structured debates on controversial issues, while the control group performed traditional speaking practices. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire regarding speaking anxiety, which was administered during the pre- and post-experiment phases. The results revealed that the SAC participants had significantly lower speaking anxiety and greater speaking confidence than the control group. The findings support the notion that SAC creates a safe and cooperative atmosphere that reduces anxiety, promotes engagement, and develops speaking ability. Furthermore, this study adds to the emerging research on innovative methods in language teaching practice and the notion that SAC not only enhances linguistic ability but also emotional autonomy and agency. The results have practical implications for teachers who are searching for an effective way to reduce communication apprehension of their foreign language learners in pursuit of more confident and competent speakers.},

However, this is a topic that has yet to receive much attention in the post-Soviet context and more specifically Kazakhstan. Currently, there is little international evidence of research on upper-secondary school teachers’ beliefs about creativity. Thus, the aim of the study was to explore how these teachers conceptualize a creative learning environment, including their beliefs about what constitutes such an environment, and how creativity can be developed in the classroom. The research was designed as a qualitative, multiple-case study comprising four different types of Kazakhstani secondary schools. Data collection included 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews. A modified conceptual framework for teachers’ beliefs about creativity (Bereczki & Kárpáti, 2018) was employed in this study. The findings revealed that teachers’ beliefs about developing a creative environment align with many empirical findings worldwide. However, a noteworthy finding of this study was that the creative environment construct of this study’s initial conceptual framework was expanded with an additional subconstruct: students’ needs. Unique to this study was that participants believe a creative environment cannot be fully effective if students’ needs (basic and psychological) are not met and if the physical environment is unsatisfactory.},

However, empirical studies on CT skill cultivation in GenAI-assisted learning are limited, especially in prevalent multimodal contexts. Integrating the CT skill framework and visual grammar, this qualitative case study developed a teaching module to foster undergraduates’ CT skills in GenAI-assisted digital multimodal composing (DMC), focusing on non-proficient AI users. It further explored four groups’ learning experiences in the classroom through students’ GenAI-assisted PowerPoint products, reflective writings, interviews, and design process observation. The findings revealed students’ more thoughtful scrutiny, comprehensive evaluation, and selective adoption of multimodal AIGC to achieve communicative purposes, with group variations and limitations in each dimension. This progress was facilitated by collaborative, revision-based DMC classwork with specifically defined, multi-dimensional requirements, systematic framework teaching, and real-time scaffolding. In conclusion, collaborative GenAI-assisted DMC practice with systematic instructional support can significantly foster students’ CT skill cultivation. These findings illuminate future pedagogical innovations to encourage deep learning and higher-order cognitive skills among a broader range of students in GenAI-assisted multimodal contexts.},

A quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent control group was employed, and creativity was assessed using the CREA test. The program was implemented over an academic year in three intervention groups, involving the utilization of various creative strategies applied to problem-solving in academic tasks. It spanned 14 weeks, with one 100-min session per week, in which ten activities were introduced. Results: The intervention program has achieved a significant development of creativity in all intervention groups, being especially relevant in one of them. The importance of sociodemographic variables, gender and age, was studied. Gender differences in creativity were not detected, neither in relation to age or academic performance of the students which suggest the need for further research in this direction. The results of the intervention program highlight the importance of teaching creativity for creative development in higher education by considering the creative learning and the characteristics of the students in order to adapt the interventions. The importance of implementing initiatives to foster creativity in university students is emphasized, highlighting the need for actions focused on teacher training and longitudinal studies to evaluate long-term effects. The research highlights the importance of creativity in higher education, showing significant improvements in the creativity of students in Early Childhood Education and in Teaching in Primary Education Degrees through specific interventions.},

As artificial intelligence develops rapidly, exploring the potential of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in fostering students’ creativity has become paramount. This study experimentally investigates the impact of design processes based on different design methods, including the AIGC-based method and the traditional design method, on the intrinsic motivation and creative outcomes of design students. Utilizing a mixed-methods research approach, this between-subjects experiment involved 52 student participants and examined the two methods across different stages of design learning. This study demonstrates that AIGC significantly enhances the design learning effect by improving usability, boosting students’ intrinsic motivation and learning experiences, and elevating creativity, while pointing out limitations like overdependence on AI and learning barriers that must be addressed for sustainable integration and long-term effectiveness. This study provides empirical evidence and theoretical guidance for the application of AIGC in design learning, offering support for future research on the impact of AIGC on creativity in interdisciplinary learning environments.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has made programming ability a core competency for college students. However, the existing single-indicator evaluation system struggles to accurately distinguish between different levels of ability, highlighting the urgent need for a scientific and multidimensional evaluation system. In this study, the AHP-TOPSIS method was adopted. Combined with the grades of programming-related courses and competition results, a multi-dimensional evaluation system for programming design ability was constructed, and a comprehensive score was given to 307 students. The results show that the weight of mathematical analysis ability is the highest (0.26), highlighting its core position in programming education. Furthermore, the comprehensive scores of students follow a normal distribution. 68 % of the students' scores are concentrated between 70 and 79 points, which can effectively distinguish students of different ability levels. Further analysis indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between course grades and competition grades (Pearson's r = 0.78), emphasizing the importance of a solid course foundation for the development of programming ability. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the comprehensive score between genders (p = 0.22, Cohen's d = -0.15), indicating that programming education should focus on individual differences rather than gender. The evaluation system proposed in this paper not only provides scientific assessment tools for educational institutions, but also offers a basis for optimizing teaching strategies, improving teaching quality and the quality of talent cultivation, which is of great significance to the reform and innovation of computer education.},

To address this gap, the present study investigated participants in the Taiwan Youth Innovation Exhibition, an annual competition that selects top projects to advance to the International Exhibition for Young Inventors. The study examined how creative self-efficacy (CSE) predicts both the Aha! experience and resilience, and how these states mediate the relationship between CSE and innovation performance. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted using data collected from student participants. Results indicated that all hypothesized relationships were supported: CSE positively predicted both the Aha! experience and resilience, and both in turn significantly predicted innovation performance. These findings suggest that encouraging students to cultivate Aha! moments and develop psychological resilience may enhance their creative outcomes in innovation-based competitions.},

It further examined the generalizability of findings by conducting comparisons between China and Finland. In total, 6667 adolescents aged 10 (Finland 3034, China 3633) from the OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills were surveyed. Results demonstrated that (1) in both countries, only teachers' emotional support showed universal positive associations with two creativity sub-dimensions; (2) Other forms of support were particularly effective for either creative self-efficacy (e.g., parents' autonomy and emotional support) or for creative performance (e.g., teachers' autonomy and competence support); (3) While Chinese parents' autonomy support associated with both creative efficacy and creative performance, Finnish parents' emotional support associated more with creative self-efficacy. Findings highlighted the critical role of teachers' emotional support as well as the complementary roles of parents' and other teachers' support in adolescents' creativity.},

Nevertheless, our understanding of how contextual factors such as socio-economic status (SES) and gender affect creativity is still limited – especially from an international perspective. In the current study, we thus examined the impact of gender and SES on creative thinking across 62 countries, using data from the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Creative thinking, alongside mathematics and reading, was analyzed using a two-stage meta-analytic approach, integrating effect sizes from country-specific samples with a total sample size of N = 493,660. Our results revealed consistent gender disparities, with females outperforming males in creative thinking and reading, a trend robust across countries but with considerable variability. Gender disparities were less pronounced in the mathematical domain. Moreover, SES was found to be a strong predictor of creative thinking, mathematics, and reading, with higher SES associated with better performance across all domains. There was no substantial interaction effect between gender and SES for creative thinking and reading, suggesting that SES advantages are consistent across genders. Our analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity between countries, emphasizing the need for context-specific educational policies. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of gender and SES on fundamental educational outcomes and hence stress the necessity of tailored interventions to address these disparities around the globe.},

In the study, in order to improve the problem-posing skills of primary school teachers by using narrative texts, the teachers were given theoretical information about problem-posing, mind and intelligence games, dialogic reading, STEM, philosophy for children, orienteering, museum education, and animation creation with the help of Web 2.0 tools (each activity took three class hours) for six class hours a day for four days. The participants were asked to construct problems from the narrative text “The Cure for Unhappiness” as a pre- and post-test. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants to determine their thoughts on problem-posing. The Wilcoxon Ranked Signs test was conducted to determine the statistically significant increase in the mathematics content strand, type, and total number of problems that the teachers constructed in the post-test compared to the pre-test. The semi-structured interviews with the teachers were analyzed with descriptive analysis. The training on narrative-text-based problem-posing given to the teachers was found to increase their non-routine problem-posing skills, although there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of problems posed by the teachers and the number of routine problems they posed. The teachers, who stated that they were inadequate in problem-posing before the training, stated that the problem-posing training using narrative texts increased their problem-posing awareness.},

Unlike previous results that describe the Euclidean and Hermitian duals of MP codes only under specific assumptions on the defining matrix, our characterization applies to MP codes with defining matrices that are not necessarily square nor of full row rank. Moreover, we consider the more general framework of Galois duals, with Euclidean and Hermitian duals treated as special cases. To demonstrate the theoretical results, several numerical examples of MP codes with best-known parameters are provided.},

  abstract = {Sediment suspension and motion due to vessel traffic in navigation channels is a challenging problem in the design and management of waterways, ports and navigation channels. This study utilised computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to investigate the impact of vessel motion on bed morphology and sediment suspension. The work was carried out for a navigation channel with sloped banks, subject to motion-induced currents and waves generated by a rectangular barge with a blunt bow, towed at constant speed. A fine sand channel bottom was modelled. The simulations, consisting of six different scenarios with two bank slope angles, two tow speeds and two vessel widths, have been carried out by FLOW-3D Hydro software. It was found out that the most significant parameter affecting sediment motion is the tow speed of the vessel, which is coupled with the vessels squat. The study further shows that ship width also plays a critical role in predicting the risk of sediment accumulation in harbour and navigation channel projects, as an increase of only 15 % in vessel width results in a large increase of 72 % in the total amount of suspended sediment. An increase in bank slopes, on the other hand, is found to have a smaller effect (15 %) on the total suspended sediment concentration.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we propose newly-derived exponential quadrature rules for stiff linear differential equations with time-dependent fractional sources in the form h ( t r ) , with 0 < r < 1 and h a sufficiently smooth function. To construct the methods, the source term is interpolated at ν collocation points by a suitable non-polynomial function, yielding to time marching schemes that we call Exponential Quadrature Rules for Fractional sources (EQRF ν ). We write the integrators in terms of special instances of the Mittag–Leffler functions that we call fractional φ functions. We perform the error analysis of the schemes in the abstract framework of strongly continuous semigroups. Compared to classical exponential quadrature rules, which in our case of interest converge with order 1 + r at most, we prove that the new methods may reach order 1 + ν r for proper choices of the collocation points. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the theoretical findings and highlight the effectiveness of the approach.},

                  Minbar polygons and the non-rectilinear generalization of them may seem to be very restricted polygon classes but they form an adjacent pair where the multiple anchored watchman routes problem has a polynomial time solution in one class but is NP-hard in the slightly more generalized class. It is this property that motivates our study of these restricted polygon classes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an immersed finite element method is proposed for solving parabolic problems on surfaces with static interfaces. Immersed finite element basis functions are constructed based on the triangular surface finite element. The advantage of the proposed method is that it allows interface across triangular elements, thereby avoiding the generation of complex fitted meshes on surfaces. Error estimates are derived for both the semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes of the proposed method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Analysis of covariance is a crucial method for improving precision of statistical tests for factor effects in randomized experiments. However, existing solutions suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are not suitable for ordinal data (as endpoints or explanatory variables); (ii) they require semiparametric model assumptions; (iii) they are inapplicable to small data scenarios due to often poor type-I error control; or (iv) they provide only approximate testing procedures and (asymptotically) exact test are missing. A resampling approach to the NANCOVA framework is investigated. NANCOVA is a fully nonparametric model based on relative effects that allows for an arbitrary number of covariates and groups, where both outcome variable (endpoint) and covariates can be metric or ordinal. Novel NANCOVA tests and a nonparametric competitor test without covariate adjustment were evaluated in extensive simulations. Unlike approximate tests in the NANCOVA framework, the proposed resampling version showed good performance in small sample scenarios and maintained the nominal type-I error well. Resampling NANCOVA also provided consistently high power: up to 26 % higher than the test without covariate adjustment in a small sample scenario with 4 groups and two covariates. Moreover, it is shown that resampling NANCOVA provides an asymptotically exact testing procedure, which makes it the first one with good finite sample performance in the present NANCOVA framework. In summary, resampling NANCOVA can be considered a viable tool for analysis of covariance overcoming issues (i) - (iv).},

  abstract = {This study presents a new definition of a fractal-fractional derivative, which integrates the concepts of fractional derivatives with non-singular kernels and fractal derivatives in the sense of Caputo and Riemann. A relationship betweem the Caputo-type and Riemann-type forms of the derivative is established and its corresponding Sawi transform is rigorously derived. This formulation unifies several known fractal-fractional derivative under a single framework, including Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio, Atangana–Baleanu and generalized Hattaf derivatives, all with non-singular kernels.
                  The Laplace transform of the proposed fractal-fractional derivative is also derived. Furthermore, the associated integral operators are studied using both the Sawi transform and Laplace transform techniques. As an application, the modified Gompertz growht model is reformulated using the Caputo–Fabrizio fractal-fractional derivative and solutions are obtained analytically using Sawi transform and Laplace transform as well as numerically.
                  To validate the analytical results, a numerical scheme based on a two-step Lagrange’s interpolation method is developed. An error analysis is carried out for various parameter values, using the numerical solution as the reference. A comparative analysis of the Sawi transform, Laplace transform and numerical method is conducted to assess their consistency, accuracy and efficiency in solving fractal-fractional gompertz model.},

  abstract = {The rapid integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education presents both opportunities and challenges in fostering critical questioning – a skill essential for critical thinking and AI literacy. In the context of GenAI, critical questioning refers to the ability to question, probe, and critically assess information generated by GenAI that will equip students with the discernment necessary in a digital world. However, there is limited research on how students develop and apply critical questioning when interacting with GenAI. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the pedagogical and contextual conditions that support high school students in critical questioning with GenAI. Through an action research study situated in a Grade 10 English classroom, the study examines the key conditions that facilitated students’ critical questioning with GenAI. Ethnographic methods were used to generate data from classroom observations, interviews, and student chatlogs that captured how students engaged with GenAI in situ within the classroom environment. A prior critical questioning framework was modified and used to identify instances of critical questioning with GenAI in the data, which were coded along the dimensions of context, delivery, and competency. Findings highlight how the instructional design of AI-mediated interactions, role of the teacher, students’ knowledge and disposition, and the delivery of GenAI platform were crucial in shaping the quality and depth of students’ questioning. These findings indicate that the success of critical engagement with GenAI does not rest on its technological capabilities alone, but on the specific pedagogical and classroom conditions that enable students to use it purposefully and reflectively. By extending our understanding of critical questioning in AI-mediated learning environments, this study provides insights into the conditions that foster AI literacy, which can lead to students actively and critically engaging with AI-generated content rather than passively consuming it.},

  abstract = {Crude oil is a highly strategic global resource, and price fluctuations significantly impact nearly all economic sectors. Therefore, accurate forecasting of its prices is essential for better financial stability and decision-making. This study aims to develop a robust model using monthly data from April 2004 to January 2024 to predict the price of crude oil. We propose a novel approach that blends ARIMAX and LSTM models using a weighted combination to leverage the strengths of econometric and machine learning methods. Unlike hybrid models, which are solely designed based on a decomposition-optimization structure, in our model, an explicit ensemble with weights via grid searching is used to enhance the model’s flexibility and performance. As ARIMAX is more efficient in dealing with linear relationships and exogenous variables, LSTM performs much better and effectively captures nonlinear patterns and long-range dependence. Weight hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation help reduce the risk of overfitting or underfitting in the model. Our empirical results indicate that the LSTM model provides a powerful forecasting baseline. The weighted ensemble model offers a marginal improvement on the chronological test set, and the Diebold-Mariano test confirms this advantage is statistically significant. Cross-validation reveals the standalone LSTM to be highly robust, highlighting the importance of component model selection. This study contributes to a more sophisticated framework for risk assessment in energy policy by revealing the crucial trade-off between a model's period-specific accuracy and its general robustness.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a nonlocal size-modified Poisson–Boltzmann (NSMPB) model and an efficient finite element iterative solver for proteins with three-dimensional molecular structures in ionic solutions containing multiple ion species. This model is the first Poisson–Boltzmann variant to simultaneously account for both nonlocal dielectric correlations and ionic size effects. The solver is constructed from a novel solution decomposition to overcome the numerical difficulties caused by the strong singularity, nonlinearity, and nonlocality of the model. It features an efficient modified Newton iterative method, an effective damping parameter selection scheme, and two good initial iteration strategies. To facilitate and streamline protein simulations, the solver is implemented as a software package that integrates a mesh generation tool, a protein data bank file retrieval program, and the PDB2PQR package. Numerical experiments involving an ionic solution with four species, three proteins with up to 11,439 atoms, and irregular interface-fitted tetrahedral meshes with up to 1,188,840 vertices demonstrate the fast convergence of the modified Newton iterative method, the efficiency of the solver, and the high performance of the package. This package provides a valuable tool for protein simulations.},

Since the domain is unbounded, a novel condition is imposed to transform it into a finite domain, allowing the application of the Tau approximation method.

To further improve convergence, we incorporate momentum acceleration and preconditioning techniques. Numerical experiments on anisotropic diffusion equations demonstrate that the proposed solvers achieve faster convergence and lower computational complexity compared to both the Chebyshev iterative method with optimal weights and the Chebyshev semi-iteration method. To mitigate the strong dependence of the aforementioned single-level neural solvers on partial differential equation parameters and grid resolution, we integrate them into two recently developed multi-level neural solver frameworks. Accordingly, we develop two specialized solvers: Richardson(

  abstract = {This article examines the mechanisms by which creativity training enhances creative abilities and confidence. An extensive creativity training program (5 months of weekly training for almost seven hundred participants aged 10-17, assigned to the intervention and control group) was used to examine two alternative hypotheses. The first predicted that the increase in creative confidence due to training is mediated by the rise in creative abilities: the abilities-shape-confidence-effect. An alternative hypothesis posited that the increase in creative abilities due to training is mediated by the rise in creative confidence: the to-believe-is-to-rise effect. Although both these effects occurred, the change in participants’ creative abilities fully mediated their growth in creative confidence. This pattern suggests metacognitive mechanisms through which creativity training works. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of those results and provide recommendations for creativity training.},

  abstract = {The newly introduced higher education curriculum focuses on skill-oriented instruction, encouraging students to engage in design-driven tasks. Despite the potential of the curriculum, its implementation faces challenges, particularly in integrating cost-effective pedagogical approaches to foster cognitive dispositions such as metacognition, creativity, and design thinking. This study investigates the effectiveness of peer and individual support mechanisms, alongside emerging AI technologies, in addressing these challenges. Specifically, it examines how these supports enhance students’ cognitive dispositions within the context of design education. The study adopts a quasi-experimental research design involving 142 undergraduate students enrolled in design-related courses. Participants are divided into groups receiving peer support, individual support, or a combination of these, with or without AI assistance. Data collection includes reflective journals, creative design tasks, and design artefacts, which are analysed using epistemic network analysis and MANOVA. Results show that peer support significantly enhances collaborative metacognitive strategies, creativity, and design thinking compared to individual support. The integration of AI provides additional support, with more potent effects in peer support groups. However, AI does not improve students' design thinking in either peer or individual support mechanisms. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional support mechanisms with AI to enhance cognitive dispositions in design education and offer a scalable solution for addressing curriculum implementation challenges while equipping students with critical 21st-century skills.},

  abstract = {Scholars have put a lot of emphasis on time-varying linear matrix equations (LMEs) problems because of its importance in science and engineering. The problem of determining the time-varying LME’s minimum-norm least-squares solution (MLLE) is therefore tackled in this work. This is achieved by the use of NHZNN, a recently developed neutrosophic logic/fuzzy adaptive high-order zeroing neural network technique. The NHZNN is an advancement on the conventional zeroing neural network (ZNN) technique, which has shown great promise in solving time-varying tasks. To address the MLLE task for arbitrary-dimensional time-varying matrices, three novel ZNN models are presented. The models perform exceptionally well, as demonstrated by two simulation studies and two real-world applications to acoustic source tracking.},

This paper establishes new properties of the Anti-Gauss Laguerre polynomials, and analyzes some “truncated” interpolation processes essentially based on their zeros. Estimates of the corresponding Lebesgue constants are proved, and error bounds in spaces of locally continuous functions, equipped with uniform weighted norms are given. Finally, some numerical tests are presented about the behavior of the Lebesgue functions and Lebesgue constants, and numerical experiments dealing with the approximation of functions having different smoothness are proposed. Comparisons with the results achieved by truncated Lagrange interpolation processes based on Laguerre zeros are shown.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to numerically solve Fredholm Integral Equations (FIEs) of the second kind, when the right-hand side term and the kernel are known only at scattered sample points. The proposed method is of the Nyström type and leverages a cubature rule based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation, with the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) technique used to select the optimal RBF shape parameter. The convergence of the method is proven in the space of continuous functions. Finally, numerical tests demonstrate the performance of the method for various RBF choices and provide direct comparisons with other RBF-based techniques for FIEs available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Recovery and forecast of network traffic data from incomplete observed data is an important issue in internet engineering and management. In this paper, by fully considering the temporal stability and periodicity features in internet traffic data, a novel optimization model for internet data recovery and forecast is proposed, which is based upon the newly introduced higher-order tensor decomposition form called tubal tensor train (TTT) decomposition. Moreover, by introducing auxiliary variables and penalty techniques, a relaxation of the proposed model is obtained. Then, an easy-to-operate and effective algorithm for solving the relaxation model is proposed. We prove that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the established relaxation model. A series of numerical experiments about the recovery of structurally missing traffic data and the traffic data prediction on the widely used real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach have favorable performance than some state-of-the-art tensor/matrix based approaches.},

  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is a key education goal internationally, and enables people to navigate the growing amount of information and make informed decisions on increasingly complex issues. The term CT is frequently used in educational policy documents and curricula, and teachers play a key role in delivering effective CT instruction. Studies indicate that although teachers recognize the importance of CT, many lack an understanding of what CT really means, and feel unprepared to teach CT. Further research is needed to obtain a deeper understanding of what CT in primary school implies. As teachers tend to teach in accordance with their perception of CT, it is important to gain an insight into how teachers understand CT. This exploratory qualitative study investigates how a group of Norwegian primary school teachers (n = 56) perceive the concept of CT, both in general and in their teaching. Using reflexive thematic analysis of reflection notes (n = 56) and semi-structured group interviews (n = 15), we found that skills are emphasized more than dispositions. Teachers primarily have a skills-disposition view of CT, with limited attention to its social dimensions. Dispositions seem to be excluded from their views of CT in relation to teaching, which is considered problematic, as dispositions can be seen as the driving force for CT. As an educational implication of our study, we can conclude that there is a need for professional development for teachers to be aware of the necessity of teaching dispositions as well as skills, and for them to include the social aspects of CT.},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning is important for assisting students in knowledge understanding and knowledge co-construction. Many studies use concept maps, a visualized tool, to aid in this process. It is crucial to look into the ways that groups of three or more people construct knowledge and to combine implicit physiological data with explicit data. In this study, we combined content analysis, ordered network analysis (ONA), and hyperscanning technology based on electroencephalograms (EEG) to analyze the data of 28 triads of high- and low-achievement groups that participated in collaborative concept mapping tasks. The frequency statistics showed that the low-achievement groups have significantly higher monitoring and adapting behavior frequencies at the individual level in the regulation dimension than the high-achievement groups. The ONA results further illustrated the sequence of knowledge transfer based on the frequency analysis. The cognitive patterns of high-achievement groups showed a cycle that began at the group level of cognition, moved to the peer level of cognition, then to the group level of regulation, and ultimately returned to the group level of cognition. The low-achievement groups' cognitive patterns also exhibited directionality, moving from the group level of regulation to the individual level of cognition and to the group level of cognition. From the implicit perspective, the theta band and temporal-parietal regions showed greater inter-brain synchrony in the high-achievement groups. Low-achievement groups, on the other hand, had comparatively lower synchrony. Their consensus was only superficial and concentrated on ensuring that everyone participated through regulation and thought integration to finish the task. Our study's findings can help teachers and instructional designers develop tailored interventions based on differences in learners' cognitive patterns during collaborative concept mapping tasks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel discrete-time fractional-order Hopfield neural network (DTHNN) designed for generating and controlling chaotic attractors with a high complexity. The proposed DTHNN is constructed based on the Caputo-delta discrete fractional operator. Furthermore, the stability of the DTHNN’s equilibrium points is analyzed using the stability theory of discrete-time fractional-order systems. The incorporation of fractional order introduces nonlinear dynamics, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to exhibit complex chaotic behavior. The suggested model is explored using various classical numerical tools, including bifurcation diagrams, maximum Lyapunov exponent spectrum, and phase plots. The findings reveal that the new discrete neural network model has a wide range of dynamical behaviors. It can exhibit numerous observed dynamical behaviors, such as periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. The complexity of the fractional system is measured using the

Additionally, the multistability of the Hopfield neural network is investigated through the coexistence of attractors using different initial conditions. Furthermore, a robust nonlinear control laws for both stabilization and synchronization to control chaotic dynamics in the proposed system are performed. It is observed that the state variables can be stabilized to the origin under the constructed control law with fractional order. In our practical application, the proposed synchronization scheme is applied to ensure secure communication.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to examine how secondary school students demonstrate abstraction skills while solving real-world problems using block-based programming platforms. The research, exploratory in nature, involved 6th-grade students in a computer science class engaging with real-world problems through Scratch. Screen recordings and interviews were used to examine the students’ ways of demonstrating abstraction. The findings showed that real-world problem contexts, combined with the features of Scratch as a block-based programming platform, supported the emergence of abstraction behaviors in problem solving process. Among the indicators of abstraction, "eliminating unnecessary blocks" and "finding clear and practical solutions" were the observed most frequently. The "applying previous solutions" has developed slightly less. These indicators of abstraction were demonstrated within the affordances of Scratch, particularly through its support for suggesting the necessity of blocks, reflecting on the complexity of solutions, presenting efficient alternative blocks, and structuring the solution for better interpretability. The results indicate that working with problems based on real-life contexts in block-based programming platforms may offer students rich opportunities to demonstrate abstraction in diverse ways through meaningful problem-solving. We hope this study will support more effective programming instruction on block-based platforms through the use of real-world problems.},

A novel method, the max-EM algorithm, is introduced, combining a constrained Hidden Markov Model with the Classification-EM algorithm. This algorithm has linear complexity and provides accurate detection of breakpoints and estimation of parameters. A theoretical result is derived, showing that the likelihood of the data, as a function of the regression parameters and the breakpoints location, increases at each step of the algorithm. Two initialization methods for the breakpoints location are also presented to address local maxima issues. Finally, a statistical test in the one breakpoint situation is developed. Simulation experiments based on linear, logistic, Poisson and Accelerated Failure Time regression models show that the final method that includes the initialization procedure and the max-EM algorithm has a strong performance both in terms of parameters estimation and breakpoints detection. The statistical test is also evaluated and exhibits a correct rejection rate under the null hypothesis and a strong power under various alternatives. Two real dataset are analyzed, the UCI bike sharing and the health disease data, where the interest of the method to detect heterogeneity in the distribution of the data is illustrated.},

A quartic quasi-interpolating spline is a piecewise polynomial of degree four satisfying C 3 continuity and fifth-order approximation, if the function to be approximated is sufficiently smooth. However, if the function has jump discontinuities, we observe that the Gibbs phenomenon appears when approximating near discontinuities. In this paper, we present nonlinear modifications of such a spline, based on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) techniques to avoid this phenomenon near discontinuities and, at the same time, maintain the fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions. We also provide some numerical and graphical tests confirming the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Detection of glaucoma progression is crucial to managing patients, permitting individualized care plans and treatment. It is a challenging task requiring the assessment of structural changes to the optic nerve head and functional changes based on visual field testing. Artificial intelligence, especially deep learning techniques, has shown promising results in many applications, including glaucoma diagnosis. This paper proposes a two-stage computational learning pipeline for detecting glaucoma progression using only fundus photographs. In the first stage, a deep learning model takes a time series of fundus photographs as input and outputs a vector of predictions where each element represents the overall rate of change in visual field (VF) sensitivity values for a sector (region) of the optic nerve head (ONH). We implemented two deep learning models—ResNet50 and InceptionResNetV2—for this stage. In the second stage, a binary classifier (weighted logistic regression) takes the predicted vector as input to detect progression. We also propose a novel method for constructing annotated datasets from temporal sequences of clinical fundus photographs and corresponding VF data suitable for machine learning. Each dataset element comprises a temporal sequence of photographs together with a vector-valued label. The label is derived by computing the pointwise linear regression of VF sensitivity values at each VF test location, mapping these locations to eight ONH sectors, and assigning the overall rate of change in each sector to one of the elements of the vector. We used a retrospective clinical dataset with 82 patients collected at multiple timepoints over five years in our experiments. The InceptionResNetV2-based implementation yielded the best performance, achieving detection accuracies of 97.28 ± 1.10 % for unseen test data (i.e., each dataset element is unseen but originates from the same set of patients appearing in the training dataset), and 87.50 ± 0.70 % for test data from unseen patients (training and testing patients are entirely different). The testing throughput was 11.60 ms per patient. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for detecting glaucoma progression from fundus photographs.},

  abstract = {Potential theory provides rigorous solutions to geodetic boundary value problems involving Laplace’s equation, often expressed through global integral transformations. However, the practical application of these solutions is hindered by the incomplete availability of high-resolution gravity data. This limitation necessitates the separate evaluation of far-zone contributions—commonly referred to as truncation errors. These errors are typically characterized using truncation coefficients, whose computation via recurrence formulas becomes numerically unstable at high altitudes and degrees when using double precision. This study presents a robust and comprehensive method for accurately computing truncation coefficients for the Poisson, Hotine, and Stokes integrals across all degrees and altitudes. The proposed approach integrates three specialized strategies: (1) an asymptotic expansion for high-degree terms to ensure both accuracy and efficiency; (2) a two-regime altitude model for low-degree terms, with binomial expansions applied at low altitudes and stabilized recurrence series used at high altitudes; and (3) double-precision numerical experiments that validate the method, showing relative errors below 10−5 for the Poisson integral and below 10−8 for the Hotine and Stokes integrals. These results demonstrate that the method is both accurate and reliable for geodetic applications at all altitudes—from airborne surveys to satellite missions—and across the full range of spherical harmonic degrees.},

Guided by the Job Demands-Resources model, the present study pioneered the investigation of the predictive power of academics’ research agendas for their emotions in teaching, considering the mediating role of academic self-efficacy (i.e., teaching efficacy and research efficacy). Participants were 332 academics from nine research-oriented comprehensive universities in mainland China. The participants responded to the Multi-Dimensional Research Agendas Inventory-12, the Research-Teaching Efficacy Inventory-6, and the Emotions in Teaching Inventory-Revised-6. Academics who were more deeply engaged in creative research agendas tended to report more positive emotions in teaching, whereas those more engaged in conventional research agendas tended to report more negative teaching emotions. These statistical predictive findings were obtained, with academics’ age, academic rank, gender, and academic discipline controlled for. Moreover, teaching efficacy provided a pathway from creative research agendas to both positive and negative teaching emotions. These findings unveiled intricate interconnections between academics’ research and teaching. The study has made theoretical contributions and it has practical implications for both academics and university senior managers in their respective efforts to promote positive teaching emotions through fostering creativity in research agendas and boosting teaching efficacy. Furthermore, the limitations of the study can provide guidance for future research directions.},

The proposed model is based on the numerical solution of a system of Navier-Stokes equations, the discretization of which is carried out by the finite volume method on an arbitrary unstructured grid, and the iterative solution is carried by the SIMPLE algorithm. During RANS calculations, an SST turbulence model is used to determine the flow parameters. In addition, developed before by authors an original method is applied to connect unmatched-grid fragments. The method accounts for the features of solving the hydrodynamic equations modeling a viscous incompressible fluid flow at the adjacent boundaries of the grid’s unmatched fragments. At the second stage of the calculation, to create artificial turbulence, the method of generating velocity fluctuations at the input boundaries of the LES region is used, adapted to account for the inconsistency of the grids between the RANS and LES regions. The developed hybrid model was applied to simulate the thermally-compressible viscous fluid flow experimentally investigated in a Vattenfall T-junction. The numerical experiments show the effectiveness and sufficient accuracy of predicting the average flow characteristics of the proposed method.},

These schemes are proved to be energy stable and of optimal order

The alternating numerical flux and the delicate boundary numerical flux are employed to effectively match the different types of boundary conditions. A key ingredient in the derivation of the optimal error estimates is the construction of appropriate projections and the handling of nonlinear error terms without the aid of a priori assumptions. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the sharpness of our theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the UWLDG schemes in solving EFK problems with small parameters.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to developing hybrid flux reconstruction (HFR) schemes through weighted correction functions. The methodology synthesizes correction functions via linear combinations of existing formulations, leading to enhanced numerical properties. The proposed framework is demonstrated by constructing hybrid schemes based on correction functions from the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), spectral difference (SD), and staggered-grid (SG) schemes, representing three well-established classes of FR schemes. Theoretical investigation through von Neumann analysis reveals the influence of weighting parameters on the dissipation and dispersion characteristics. Numerical experiments with the linear advection equation, linearized Euler equations and nonlinear Euler equations demonstrate that optimally weighted correction functions can achieve superior accuracy and stability compared to their constituent base schemes. Specifically, the optimal weighting coefficient in the HFR1 scheme enables it to achieve even higher accuracy than the DG scheme, whereas the optimal weighting coefficient in the HFR2 scheme yields a CFL limit exceeding that of the SG scheme. From a practical perspective, this work provides a straightforward approach for generating a wide range of FR schemes with predictable numerical characteristics.},

  abstract = {Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy enhances dose delivery by dynamically adjusting beam intensities to target tumorous tissues while preserving healthy organs. One of the most effective planning approaches uses the Generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose metric, which ensures high-quality treatment plans but requires tuning several hyperparameters for each anatomical structure. Traditionally, this process is performed manually by clinical experts, making it time-consuming and dependent on human expertise. To address these challenges, a previous method combined multi-objective evolutionary search with gradient-based optimization to automate the tuning process. However, this hybrid strategy incurs high computational cost, as each candidate solution must undergo a complete gradient-based optimization step, repeated thousands of times throughout the process. This study introduces two complementary strategies to improve the efficiency of this framework. First, we analyze alternative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms that converge more rapidly, thereby reducing the number of required function evaluations, and we compare three gradient-based optimization methods to identify the one that accelerates convergence without compromising plan quality. Second, we implement a parallel computing framework that distributes the function evaluations across heterogeneous multicore computing clusters using a static batch scheduling strategy adapted to each node’s computational capacity. Combined, these algorithmic and computational enhancements yield an acceleration factor of 4049 compared to the original implementation. As a result, high-quality radiotherapy treatment plans can be automatically generated in approximately one hour, making this approach viable for integration into time-constrained clinical workflows.},

The findings revealed four key themes which characterized the pre-service teachers’ creative experiences: (1) learning a new skill, (2) expressing creativity and experiencing a sense of accomplishment, (3) overcoming challenges related to fear and insecurity, and (4) achieving personal fulfillment and professional growth. These open-ended projects fostered an environment where the pre-service teachers could take risks, embrace failure, and reflect on their development, building essential skills such as problem-solving, creative confidence, and resilience. This approach equipped pre-service teachers with the skills and mindset necessary to foster creativity in their future classrooms, supporting both their personal and professional growth.},

Drawing upon Broaden-and-Build Theory, this study investigates how two core dimensions of trait curiosity, namely stretching (the drive to seek new knowledge) and embracing (the willingness to tolerate uncertainty), foster the development of PsyCap over time. Furthermore, the study examines how three distinct forms of imagination (initiating, conceiving, and transforming) moderate these relationships. Using a two-wave, time-lagged design, data were collected from 519 trained volunteers participating in science education programs. Results indicate that both stretching and embracing curiosity significantly predict subsequent PsyCap, but these effects are uniquely moderated by different facets of imagination. More importantly, imagination exhibits a dual influence: depending on its type, it can either amplify or constrain the positive impact of curiosity on PsyCap development. These findings advance our understanding of the cognitive pathways underpinning PsyCap and highlight practical implications for designing interventions in educational and professional learning environments.},

A quasi-experimental design was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. The study involved two groups of university students: an experimental group (24 students) exposed to CT-integrated PjBL and a control group (23 students) taught using conventional PjBL method. Results demonstrated that CT-integrated PjBL significantly enhanced students’ knowledge construction and affective-domain learning objectives, including motivation, attitude, and self-efficacy, compared to the conventional approach. These findings underscore the potential of combining CT with PjBL to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

The developed DT test was initially evaluated with participants from an enrichment program during the first study. For validation, intelligence was measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices 2, as well as scientific inquiry skills in biology, inductive thinking skills in biology, situational interest, and subjective task values across different subjects. In the second study, the developed DT test was applied to a randomized sample from different schools. In both studies, the DT test demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability. The investigation into the factor structure showed that each task represented a different factor, and the test has limited ability to measure individual DT constructs. Positive correlations were identified between fluency and scientific inquiry skills, as well as between fluency and scientific inductive thinking. The results indicate that the developed test is capable of measuring facets of subject-specific DT and provides an initial option for researchers and educators to assess DT in biology. Future research should explore the effects of different task types, instructions, and time limits. Replications for other STEM subjects, age groups, and comparisons to classic DT tests should be conducted.},

In addition, this study seeks to portray the strategies prospective mathematics teachers used during the inductive reasoning process as they evaluate the truth value of statements in terms of non-Euclidean geometries. To this end, 106 participants were asked to evaluate the truth value of six statements, which are true in Euclidean geometry, in terms of elliptic and hyperbolic geometries, and explain their reasoning. Through this comparative and evaluative task, participants were naturally engaged in an inductive reasoning process. According to the findings, at least a quarter of the participants presented incorrect answers for every statement. The strategies observed during the inductive reasoning process were classified under thirteen categories: visualizing geometry surface/concept(s) in the statement, drawing by considering geometry surface/concept(s) in the statement, drawing without explanation, considering the definition of the main concept in the statement, presenting/aiming to present a counterexample/countercase, stating the absence of a counterexample/countercase, pointing a similarity/difference with Euclidean geometry, associating with the fifth postulate, generalizing, relating to another discipline, considering the cases necessary for the statement to be true, offering the presence of various cases based on the predicate of the statement, and identifying a specific relation between the concepts of the statement.},

These factors influence the viability and survival of juvenile predators, leading to potential deviations in population predictions. To account for the inherent memory and hereditary properties in ecological interactions, we employ fractional-order derivatives, thereby extending the classical prey–predator framework. The proposed model accounts for maturation delays, stage-specific interactions, and differential survival rates, offering a more comprehensive understanding of population stabilization across multiple life stages. Our analysis highlights how structural complexity in the habitat critically affects juvenile hunting efficiency and the associated maladroit costs, such as increased mortality due to unsuccessful hunting attempts during key developmental periods. Both analytical and numerical techniques are employed to investigate the stability and bifurcation behavior of the system under varying ecological parameters. The results underscore the importance of habitat features and predator limitations in shaping population dynamics and ecological resilience. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of biodiversity conservation and the strategic management of ecosystems under natural and anthropogenic pressures.},

This approach captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, leading to more accurate descriptors and more efficient computational processes. However, even fundamental tasks like compression and data enhancement present meaningful challenges in the manifold setting. This paper introduces a multiscale transform that aims to represent manifold-valued sequences at different scales, enabling novel data processing tools for various applications. Similar to traditional methods, our construction is based on a refinement operator that acts as an upsampling operator and a corresponding downsampling operator. Inspired by Wiener’s lemma, we term the latter as the reverse of the former. It turns out that some upsampling operators, for example, least-squares-based refinement, do not have a practical reverse. Therefore, we introduce the notion of pseudo-reversing and explore its analytical properties and asymptotic behavior. We derive analytical properties of the induced multiscale transform and conclude the paper with numerical illustrations showcasing different aspects of the pseudo-reversing and two data processing applications involving manifolds.},

Two equilibrium states are identified: a boundary equilibrium and a positive (interior) equilibrium, whose existence depends on the relative cost structures of the firms. For the non-delayed case, we derive conditions for the local stability of both equilibria and demonstrate that a flip (period-doubling) bifurcation occurs as the adjustment speed increases. When time delays are introduced, the stability properties of the boundary equilibrium remain unaffected, while the dynamics of the interior equilibrium become sensitive to the overall delay. In particular, when the leader and follower updates are effectively synchronized, reflecting a collective timing of reactions, the stability region of the positive equilibrium expands, and a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation is observed; in contrast, asynchronous updates yield dynamics similar to those of the non-delayed model. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the various routes to chaotic behavior. These results emphasize the role of reaction timing and delay interactions in shaping market dynamics in oligopolistic settings.},

  abstract = {The dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys is closely related to both the internal strengthening phases and external impact loads. However, the prediction of fracture toughness is challenging due to complex factors such as multi-scale effects, non-linearity, and strong correlations. To address these challenges, a novel prediction method for the dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys has been proposed, which integrates multi-scale numerical simulations (physical models) with machine learning techniques. This method considers both external factors (impact velocity) and internal factors (the size and distribution of strengthening phases).The study analyzes the correlation between impact velocity, the size and distribution of strengthening phases, and dynamic fracture toughness. It also proposes an optimization strategy for the hidden layer depth and the number of neurons in the neural network, resulting in an optimal network structure (8 layers with 25 neurons per layer) for predicting dynamic fracture toughness. Based on this optimized network structure, the study identifies the optimal sample size (N = 90) for ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy in the fracture toughness model. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted on the fitting and prediction performance of various machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees (DT). Among these, the ANN model demonstrates the best performance, with an average absolute error of 6.73 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.98. Additional validation confirms the model's excellent capability for both interpolation and extrapolation.This research successfully achieves accurate predictions of the dynamic fracture toughness of nickel-based alloys, incorporating physical information transfer.

However, a shortage of computer science teachers in schools limits students’ opportunities to develop these skills. To address this gap, developing computer programming MOOCs can be a scalable solution, enabling students to transition from technology users to creators. This paper aims to analyze, describe, and evaluate the development process of the computer programming MOOC “From Technology Consumer to Creator” (TCC) for youths, highlighting its potential to mitigate the shortage of computer science education opportunities. Developmental research design is used to research the TCC course development process. Stages of the ADDIE model (Analyze, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) are used to describe the process. 1386 students from more than half of the secondary-level schools in Estonia participated in the course, and more than 40 % of participants finished the course successfully. Results show that both learners and mentors were satisfied with the topics and course materials and found the course to be useful, interesting, and feasible. Human support from mentors and organizers is more valuable to adolescents than machine support, such as automated feedback. Overall, the TCC course is a good example of an introductory programming MOOC for adolescents, where successful students can continue their studies at the university. The results of our study provide valuable insights for developing programming MOOCs with various engagement strategies for increasing course completion rates for young people, which can benefit other MOOC developers and instructors planning computer science courses for youths.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the construction of rational motions of a minimal quaternionic degree that generate a prescribed plane trajectory (a “rational torse”). Using the algebraic framework of dual quaternions, we formulate the problem as a system of polynomial equations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such motions, establish a method to compute solutions and characterize solutions of minimal degree. Our findings reveal that a rational torse is realizable as a trajectory of a rational motion if and only if its Gauss map is rational. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the minimal degree of a motion polynomial is geometrically related to a drop of degree of the Gauss and algebraically determined by the structure of the torse’s associated plane polynomial and the real greatest common divisor of its vector part. The developed theoretical framework has potential applications in robotics, computer-aided design, and computational kinematic, offering a systematic approach to constructing rational motions of small algebraic complexity.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new splitting approach for the numerical solution of a nonlinear Kawarada equation with mixed derivative terms. Such equations model physical phenomena where the solution remains bounded while its time derivative may become unbounded, reflecting strong quenching behavior. The proposed method decomposes the Kawarada equation into interconnected components, which are then approximated using diagonally stretched finite difference formulas. To effectively handle the quenching singularity and dynamics, a semi-adaptive procedure is incorporated. The resulting implicit splitting strategy is shown to be numerically stable and convergent without requiring the freezing or linearization of the nonlinear source term, as is common in conventional analysis. The new method enables accurate computation of key quenching characteristics, such as quenching time, location, and critical values, which are validated against known solutions.
                  Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and to assess the convergence order of the implemented diagonally stretched splitting scheme.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for reasoning problems. They are among the leading techniques for context inference, particularly in scenarios with strong sequential dependencies, where earlier inputs dynamically influence subsequent responses. However, existing reasoning paradigms such as X-of-thoughts (XoT) typically rely on unidirectional, left-to-right inference with limited inference paths. This renders them ineffective in handling inherent skip logic and multi-path reasoning, especially for contexts such as a multi-turn social survey. To address this, we propose Random Forest of Thoughts (RFoT), a novel prompting framework grounded in the principles of reasoning path fusion for skip logic. It uses Iterative Chain-of-Thought (ICoT) prompting to generate a diverse set of reasoning thoughts. These thoughts are then assessed using a cooperative contribution evaluator to estimate their contribution. By randomly sampling and fusing the top-
                        k
                      reasoning thoughts, RFoT simulates uncertain skip logic and constructs a rich forest of plausible thoughts. This enables it to achieve robust multi-path reasoning, where each question sequence formed by the skip logic is treated as an independent reasoning path. RFoT is validated on two classic social problems featuring strong skip logic, using three open-source LLMs and five datasets that have been categorized as structured social surveys and public social media data. Experimental results demonstrate that RFoT significantly enhances inference performance on problems that require complex, non-linear reasoning across both survey and social media data. The transparency and trustworthiness of the results stem from the interpretable fusion of diverse reasoning paths and the principled integration of cooperative evaluation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Determining multiscale properties of the media is a challenging task because the observables often are of a macroscopic nature, e.g., production data in porous heterogeneous flows. This paper proposes a new approach for determining effective properties for multicontinuum models that arise in multiscale problems. Multicontinuum models use multiple macroscopic parameters in each coarse grid block for accurate prediction. Each macroscopic variable is associated with a local constraint problem for the averages. By changing the number of continua, one can achieve better accuracy while having continuous coarse-scale quantities (with physical meaning), such as solutions and effective properties. As a result, the inversion is performed on a coarse grid using smoothing constraints. In the proposed approach, the problem of computing is transformed into a problem of parameter identification and determining the macroscopic model representing the underlying multiscale problem. An optimization approach called an artificial bee colony algorithm is used for parameter identification. As an example, a dual continuum model is considered. A regular algorithm with fixed weight coefficients of smoothing constraints and a balanced algorithm in which the weight coefficients are updated to keep the objective function members balanced are proposed. To verify the proposed multicontinuum inversion approach, model problems with different heterogeneous properties and source terms are considered. Both optimization algorithms can efficiently identify the effective properties of the multicontinuum model. The balanced algorithm achieves faster convergence, while the regular algorithm provides smoother effective properties.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent probes are widely employed in metal ion detection because of their high responsiveness and ability to distinguish between different ions. These probes provide continuous, non-invasive monitoring of ions, making them valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Herein, we synthesized a fluorescent probe 1 having a naphthalimide-benzothiazole skeleton for the selective detection of Fe3+ ions. The optical characteristics of the probe exhibit ratiometric behavior in absorption spectroscopy, whereas a “turn-off” fluorescence response is observed upon interaction with Fe3+ ions. These perturbations could be attributed to the formation of a metal-probe complex, thereby altering the electronic configuration. Further, the LOD for Fe3+ was determined to be 1.05 μM. The probe was found to exhibit reversibility and recyclability in the presence of a chelating agent, EDTA. The electronic structure analysis of the probe and its Fe3+ complex was conducted using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. It exhibits a decrease in HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon metal coordination, suggesting enhanced stability and reactivity. The probe also exhibits favorable nonlinear optical properties, with a significant hyperpolarizability value, highlighting its potential for optical applications. Additionally, the topological analysis revealed the spatial localization of the electrons in the probe and its complex. To gain biological insights, in silico studies of probe 1 were carried out with DNA and serum proteins such as HSA and BSA, underscoring its dual functionality as both a probe and a potential therapeutic agent. Molecular docking studies further substantiated the favorable interactions between probe 1 and its biological targets (HSA and BSA), thereby confirming its biological relevance and supporting its potential for efficient target-specific delivery in the human body when used as a therapeutic agent.},

The participants (N = 85) completed cognitive ability tasks (Japanese version of the Semantic Similarities Test, Raven Progressive Matrices Short, and Ideation fluency task) and a metaphorical interpretation task, in which they listed multiple features of the presented metaphors. Each participant’s interpretation of the metaphors was modeled using the predication model, and the parameters (k and m) were determined to maximize the evaluation metrics (Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank). We found that the similarity reasoning ability affected the spreading activation of the vehicle concept and the degree of constraints on the topic. Compared to previous studies that found that the outcome of metaphor comprehension relates to similarity reasoning ability, our results showed that similarity reasoning ability is also related to the processes of metaphor comprehension.},

Given the growing complexity of today’s societal challenges, tackling them both requires inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to research and teaching. This study shows how an innovative teaching approach, which integrated street-art into an inter- and transdisciplinary course, facilitated new opportunities for learning to address complex societal issues in a higher education setting. The application of street-art as a ‘boundary object’ catalysed knowledge integration and interdisciplinary collaboration by facilitating communication, bridging disciplinary and cultural divides, and forging a shared language among students. We found that engagement with, and the production of, street-art fostered inter- and transdisciplinary learning in the following ways: 1) street-art supported the development of new competencies for students, such as humility and a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives, 2) street-art served as a means for learning to collaborate effectively in a team, and 3) street-art enabled the bridging of cultural differences, challenging students’ prior views on art and its purposes. Additionally, we found that the use of a non-traditional medium, the course design, and the collaboration with an art-based community partner were crucial in facilitating these learning processes. We conclude that street-art is a valuable tool for promoting inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to teaching, in which diverse perspectives can come together, and independent, critical, and creative thinking are fostered.},

Theoretically, PIA not only reinforces the experiential dimension of learning and aligns with constructivist principles but also enables learners to concretize abstract concepts through hands-on activities, supported by puzzle-type materials.

  abstract = {The primary inspiration behind shrinkage methods is the desire to reduce variance without significantly increasing bias. At the heart of shrinkage estimators lies the concept of the bias-variance trade-off. Shrinkage estimators intentionally introduce a small bias by pulling estimates towards a central value, significantly reducing variance and thereby lowering the mean squared error. Many industries, such as banking, healthcare, and environmental research, where precise parameter estimation is necessary for modelling and decision-making, benefit from shrinkage estimation in gamma density utilizing prior information. This manuscript presents a class of interval shrinkage estimators to estimate the scale parameter of gamma density when prior information or guessed values about the parameter in the form of lower and upper bounds are available, and studies their properties. In particular, three classes of shrinkage estimators of the scale parameter based on arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean of interval estimators are also derived.Theoretical comparison given to show the performance over unbiased and MMSE estimator. An empirical study is carried out in order to judge the merits of the suggested interval shrinkage estimation over others.},

  abstract = {In the 21st century, the ability to think critically has become an essential skill that can be effectively fostered by dialogic teaching methods. However, teachers frequently struggle to engage students in instructional settings that require interaction and dialogue within classroom discourse. Using a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods research design, this study explored how a planned whole-class teaching discourse strategy affected the critical thinking disposition of 102 eighth-grade students from two Hong Kong schools. A validated critical thinking disposition questionnaire was used for pre- and post-test data collection to assess the effect of the teaching discourse intervention. Paired t-test results revealed significant pre- and post-test differences in the overall score and Truth-seeking, Systematicity, and Maturity of Judgment subset scores in the experimental group. However, no pre- and post-test changes were found in the control group. Further analysis of 32 classroom discourse video recordings conducted using a talk move framework identified three contributing factors that seemed to boost students’ critical thinking disposition in the experimental group: a range of talk moves, the turn-taking pattern between teachers and students, and timely, descriptive, and specific praise from teachers. This study contributes to the existing literature on the effectiveness of deliberately employing classroom talk wherein the talk move strategy encourages both students and teachers to engage in critical thinking, thereby fostering cognitive engagement in a nurturing learning environment.},

Moreover, this investigation explores the potential roles that trait resilience and psychological richness may play in the interplay between trauma and creativity. The data collection process involved administering questionnaires to assess participants’ trauma history, psychological richness, trait resilience, and creative activities and achievements. Additionally, the Alternative Uses Test was utilized to evaluate creative thinking. This study gathered data from a sample of 649 college students (228 males and 421 females). Findings from the path analysis model reveal that: (1) exposure to trauma can positively predict the four facets of creativity — fluency (β = 0.146), originality (β = 0.193), engagement in creative activities (β = 0.170), and creative accomplishments (β = 0.200); (2) trait resilience is positively related to both fluency (β = 0.198) and originality (β = 0.185), and it serves as a moderator in the relationship between trauma exposure and creative accomplishments and activities; and (3) psychological richness acts as a mediator in the effects of trauma exposure on originality (β = 0.012), creative accomplishments (β = 0.014), and the frequency of creative activities (β = 0.025). By extending the scope of existing research on trauma and creativity, this study offers valuable insights into the development of effective psychological interventions for individuals coping with trauma's aftermath.},

  abstract = {Background:
                  Despite extensive research on creative thinking, the role of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in enhancing this skill, particularly among students with varying knowledge levels, has been understudied, particularly in terms of causal relationships.
               
                  Objective:
                  The study aims to explore the causal effects of academic achievement and ICT use on the development of creative thinking, focusing on how ICT impacts students with different academic performances.
               
                  Methods:
                  Employing causal inference, the study analyzes the impact of ICT on creativity across various academic levels to identify differences in creative thinking trajectories among student groups.
               
                  Results:
                  A positive link was found between academic achievement and creative thinking. The effects of ICT on creativity differ by student group: School ICT use (USESCH) may hinder creativity in top students but boost it in lower-performing ones.Homework-related ICT (HOMESCH) benefits high achievers but can be detrimental to younger students. Leisure-time ICT use (ENTUSE) negatively affects creativity in both groups. High achievers’ ICT interest (INTICT) stimulates creativity, while younger students may be negatively affected. Students’ perceived ICT application ability (COMPICT) enhances creativity in high achievers, not in younger students. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) tool analysis confirmed these findings.
               
                  Conclusions:
                  Academic performance correlates with creative thinking abilities, and ICT impacts creativity differently across academic levels, highlighting the importance of ICT integration in education for fostering creativity. The findings suggest that educational policies should take into account the varying impacts of ICT on creativity across different student academic levels, thereby underscoring the significance of integrating ICT in a tailored manner within the educational framework.},

Results demonstrated the superiority of multi-CDM over six single CDMs: it achieved a decent model-data fit, the highest test-level classification accuracy (72.1%) and subskill-level reliability (87%-95.8%), showing robust diagnostic performance. Subsequent diagnosis revealed pronounced disparities: high-proficiency learners excelled in literal comprehension and local inferences, yet struggled with temporal inference. Low-proficiency learners exhibited systemic deficiencies, particularly in global inferences and literal comprehension, underscoring cognitive overload challenges. Instructional implications were provided to different groups. Finally, limitations and future directions were discussed.},

  abstract = {While most literature on critical thinking emphasizes its cognitive dimension, this study explores criticality as a metacognitive experience in cultivating critical citizenship. Drawing on Paul Ricœur’s (1965/1970) hermeneutics of suspicion, it examines how criticality influences citizenship by encouraging individuals to evolve their interpretations of official discourses. Using Chinese citizenship education as a case study, narrative interviews with 12 purposively selected graduates from elite Chinese universities investigate changes in their interpretive stances over time. Thematic analysis identifies a four-stage, semi-iterative model of worldview transformation: participants initially accepted curricular content uncritically but subsequently encountered moments of suspicion that triggered metacognitive reflection and prompted reconstruction of their worldviews. Academic training contributed variably to this process. Confronted with everyday suspicions in social interactions and tensions between state narratives and personal interpretations, participants transformed themselves into critical beings through hermeneutic circle to reconcile these discourse gaps. Thus, the study advances understanding of how criticality can be unexpectedly activated, reflexively exercised, and intellectually directed to foster critical, reflexive, and deliberative citizenship. It also highlights the need for further research on the unintended civic effects of cultivating critical thinking, particularly its role in demystifying ideology, promoting epistemic autonomy, and constructing alternative worldviews.},

Efficiently computing these solutions is crucial for a profound understanding of these problems and enhancing various applications. Therefore, the development of a numerical method capable of finding multiple solutions efficiently is imperative. Additionally, the provision of an efficient iteration process is vital for promptly obtaining multiple solutions. In the current paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for identifying multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic systems, where the trust region Levenberg–Marquardt method, combined with the deflation technique, is designed to compute multiple solutions for the first time. Based on several numerical experiments, our algorithm demonstrates efficacy in efficiently identifying multiple solutions, even when the nonlinear term appearing in these equations involves solely the first derivative. Moreover, we validate the efficiency of our algorithm and unveil previously undiscovered solutions in the existing literature},

Participants addressed three core themes: (a) challenges in competency development, (b) barriers to sustainable growth, and (c) institutional/non-institutional strategies for promoting SCD. Using grounded theory, the analysis reveals that institutional and non-institutional factors collectively constrain students’ SCD, including curricular gaps, pedagogical limitations, and underdeveloped autonomous learning practices. The findings further highlight disparities in faculty expertise, inadequate alignment between coursework and practical teaching demands, and limited support for lifelong learning competencies. To address these issues, this study proposes a series of evidence-based countermeasures: reforming teaching methodologies in accordance with self-determination theory (SDT), enhancing faculty training through the integration of the TPACK framework, redesigning curricula to incorporate sustainable development perspectives, establishing collaborative learning environments to promote resource equity and improve teaching conditions, and cultivating students’ self-directed learning skills grounded in SDT principles. These recommendations are designed to ensure that PEE programs remain aligned with the evolving requirements of primary English education and facilitate the long-term professional development of graduates.},

  abstract = {Creativity is an essential skill in contemporary education systems, particularly in early childhood, where it is stimulated by exploratory activities and the expression of thought through the creation of ideas or the production of new objects. However, its assessment remains a major challenge, particularly for future teachers, who have to reconcile the emergence of creativity with the requirements of training plans. This dual injunction reveals a hesitancy on the part of professionals regarding the definition of creativity and the ways in which its manifestations in students can be assessed. This study explores how future teachers of early childhood integrate evaluation criteria measuring the development of creativity into their evaluation documents. It aims to understand which dimensions of the creative process and theoretical models, such as the 3Ps and the OECD Creative Assessment Grid, are mobilised in an evaluative context. Two hypotheses guided this work: (1) trainee teachers give priority to technical and observable dimensions, often to the detriment of the creative process, and (2) transversal aspects, such as originality and collaboration, are underrepresented. To test these hypotheses, 153 evaluation documents produced by student teachers at the HEP Vaud were analysed using a specific grid. The study combined an analysis of proportions, correlations and a hierarchical classification of evaluation criteria. The results reveal that emphasis is placed on technical and methodological criteria, such as respect for constraints and diversity of materials, while less tangible dimensions, such as originality and collaboration, are marginally taken into account. These trends reflect the systemic challenges involved in assessing creativity that is non-linear and exploratory in nature in early childhood. These initial elements are in line with previous research which emphasises the predominance of observable and measurable aspects of the evaluation of creativity, to the detriment of the creative process, which is more complex to identify. The study also highlights a preference for assessing individual performance to the detriment of more collaborative dynamics. This observation highlights the need to reassess the way in which creativity is understood and taught in teacher training programmes. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of equipping future teachers with tools to assess both tangible outcomes and intangible processes, paving the way for a balanced and effective approach to promoting creativity in young learners in a rapidly changing educational landscape.},

Previous cross-sectional studies yielded mixed findings on the relationship between social media use (SMU) and self-perceived creativity. It remains unclear how multiple aspects of SMU are associated with self-perceived creativity over time. This study aims to investigate the links between self-perceived creativity and various facets of SMU, including duration, form, and purpose. We conducted a 14-day diary study (N = 208) and a six-month interval survey (N = 204). Residual dynamic structural equation modeling results revealed that active SMU, social-oriented, and cognitive-oriented SMU positively predicted self-perceived creativity on the same day. Conversely, the duration of SMU, passive SMU, and hedonic-oriented SMU had no significant effects. Furthermore, longitudinal regression analyses showed that only social-oriented and cognitive-oriented SMU positively predicted self-perceived creativity six months later. Notably, no significant predictive effects were found from self-perceived creativity to SMU. These findings suggest that the impact of SMU on self-perceived creativity depends on the specific ways people engage with social media.},

By exploiting the GSTC-characterized metasurface properties, we develop a residual-type posteriori error estimator, and rigorously prove its boundedness. Using an absorbing metasurface as a benchmark case, we demonstrate the convergence of the AFEM based on this error estimator. Numerical experiments on diverse functional metasurfaces verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves both the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulations, providing a reliable theoretical framework and numerical tools for the design and analysis of functional metasurfaces.},

The differential equation contains a zero order term. Compared to the case of no zero order term, the character of the exponential splines are more complicated and the associated pointwise error analysis relies more on the finite element formulation. Error bounds are given in a global pointwise norm. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the method.},

A particular feature of the scheme is that the nonlinear terms are treated explicitly while being unconditionally energy stable.

Moreover, we verify the pricing accuracy of the approximated solutions for perpetual American strangle options under SVCEV by comparing our solutions with the prices derived from Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we analyze the price sensitivities of the options and free boundaries in terms of several model parameters.

  abstract = {A fractional partition of unity finite element method is proposed for the solution of the transient anomalous diffusion equation. The Caputo integro-differential operator is employed to represent the fractional time-derivative in these problems. To approximate the Caputo fractional derivative, we propose a new numerical differentiation formula using quadratic splines. For the spatial discretization, we implement an enriched finite element method on unstructured meshes. In the present study, a category of exponential functions incorporating fractional orders is introduced as enrichment functions to refine the finite element approximation. These functions are designed to capture the fractional characteristics of the solution more effectively. By integrating these enrichment functions through the partition of unity framework, the method utilizes prior knowledge of the fractional problem, leading to a substantial enhancement in approximation accuracy while preserving the fundamental advantages of the traditional finite element method. Consequently, the proposed approach delivers precise numerical solutions even with coarse meshes and requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom compared to conventional finite element techniques. Moreover, the mesh resolution remains unaffected by variations in the fractional order, allowing for a consistent mesh structure regardless of changes in fractional parameters. Through extensive numerical simulations, we consistently verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique in achieving high levels of accuracy. This approach not only ensures reliable and precise results but also broadens the applicability of the finite element method, making it more capable of handling time-fractional transient diffusion problems that have traditionally been challenging for standard methods.},

We also propose a method for a special eigenvalue interface problem in engineering, the two-group neutron diffusion problem. We incorporates the idea of decoupling energy loss functions and changes the eigenvalue equations into fixed-source equations. As the neural network is optimized, the fixed-source term evolves with the iterative steps. Finally, ample numerical experiments are presented to validate our methods.},

                  Utilizing a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design, the study examined 156 eighth-grade students from two schools in Hong Kong over an eight-week period. Within each school, a control group was instructed using traditional pedagogical techniques, whereas two distinct experimental groups were exposed to the argumentation model, with one integrating the talk approach to encourage a dialogic classroom environment. Data collection involved validated pre- and post-test results from critical thinking tests, as well as whole-class teaching discourses.
                  The findings revealed a significant difference between the two experimental groups in the paired t-test results of the critical thinking test. Further analysis of the classroom discourses showed the argumentation model with talk approach to be more effective in promoting active learning and the development of metacognitive skills than the argumentation model alone. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the effectiveness of argumentative inquiry and productive classroom talk, particularly that addressing the development of critical thinking skills in secondary school-age students.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational thinking (CT) has gained growing attention in education, especially as societies become more reliant on digital technologies. Despite the growing emphasis on integrating CT into K − 12 curricula, there is still a shortage of validated tools for assessing CT practices among younger students. This study addresses this gap by developing and validating a game-based assessment tool called Critters Puzzle (CP), specifically designed to evaluate abstraction skills, a key dimension of CT practices, in lower primary school students (Grades 1–3). Based on a principled approach known as evidence-centered game design (ECGD), a set of game tasks independent of programming platforms was developed. The tool’s content validity was confirmed through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by field tests. Psychometric analyses were performed with both Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and the results demonstrate adequate reliability and validity indicators. Further analysis of students’ game performance revealed that female students exhibited stronger abstraction skills. Then, the process data was used to identify students’ problem-solving strategies, and the analysis revealed distinct strategies among students, with observable gender disparities. This study introduces a carefully developed and validated assessment tool tailored for early-grade students within the context of Chinese primary school, focusing on the evaluation of abstraction skills in CT practices. The research process has the potential to support future assessment development in CT education and may serve as a reference for similar educational settings. The findings of process data highlight the importance of designing assessment tools that accommodate different problem-solving strategies and provide valuable insights for enhancing lower primary CT education.},

Although reading self-efficacy and creative self-efficacy were not directly associated with problem-solving performance, they showed significant indirect associations: reading self-efficacy was associated with better problem-solving accuracy via enhanced text-based comprehension, and creative self-efficacy with more novel solutions through increased divergent thinking. These findings provide insights into cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational factors that may support the development of problem-solving skills, with implications for educational practices.},

To further investigate this spatial effect and elucidate the underlying mechanism, the current study used a controlled manipulation of space size. We aimed at replicating the influence of space size on divergent and convergent thinking, while also examining defocused attention as a potential underlying mechanism through the Auditory Stroop Task. In Experiment 1, participants performed the Alternate Uses Task, Remote Association Task, and Auditory Stroop Task in both large and small physical spaces. Results indicated no significant differences in task performance across spatial conditions, with Bayesian analyses strongly supporting the null hypothesis. Experiment 2 employed a virtual reality environment, presenting participants with large and small virtual rooms where they completed the same three cognitive tasks using a virtual reality headset. Findings demonstrated higher novelty scores in divergent thinking in the smaller (vs. larger) virtual space, but no significant differences in other tasks. Bayesian analyses again favored the null hypothesis. Overall, the findings of the two experiments suggest that space size, whether manipulated in the physical or virtual environment, does not influence divergent thinking, convergent thinking, or defocused attention. The implications of these findings on embodied metaphor and defocused attention accounts are discussed.},

These observations directly influenced the development of a 10-week STEAM-oriented scientific curriculum based on the ideas of connected learning. We used the 21st Century Learning and Innovation Skills Scale, the Social Entrepreneurship Intentions Scale, and the Digital Literacy Scale to test people before and after training. We used structural equation modeling to look at the data. The results showed that combining STEAM activities with connected learning greatly improved students' digital media literacy. This was made even better by their gaining of 21st-century skills and social entrepreneurship abilities.

Using RMSE, MAPE, R², training and prediction durations, and computational variance, three models—Random Forest, SVR, and XGBoost—are examined. Although Random Forest exhibits increased temporal complexity and unpredictability in prediction timeframes, it achieves the highest predictive accuracy with a R² score of 0.999998 in AdDarb and comparable results across other cities. For quick and consistent forecasting, XGBoost is perfect as it provides competitive accuracy, low prediction time variation, and computational economy. Although less accurate, SVR performs best in low training and prediction timeframes, which qualifies it for environments with limited resources. This work offers a complete framework for choosing machine learning models fit to the dynamic and high-stakes criteria of COVID-19 prediction by including temporal variance and computational trends. XGBoost's balanced performance makes it advised to provide top priority for real-time forecasting situations; Random Forest might be saved for tasks stressing great predictive accuracy. SVR may also be effectively used in environments with low processing capacity. The main novelty of this study lies in integrating model scalability, prediction consistency, and time-complexity metrics into a unified framework for real-time public health forecasting in Saudi Arabia.},

  abstract = {A novel method is introduced for denoising partially observed signals over networks using graph total variation (TV) regularization, a technique adapted from signal processing to handle binary data. This approach extends existing results derived for Gaussian data to the discrete, binary case — a method hereafter referred to as “one-bit TV denoising.” The framework considers a network represented as a set of nodes with binary observations, where edges encode pairwise relationships between nodes. A key theoretical contribution is the establishment of consistency guarantees of graph TV denoising for the recovery of underlying node-level probabilities. The method is well suited for settings with missing data, enabling robust inference from incomplete observations. Extensive numerical experiments and real-world applications further highlight its effectiveness, underscoring its potential in various practical scenarios that require denoising and prediction on networks with binary-valued data. Finally, applications to two real-world epidemic scenarios demonstrate that one-bit total variation denoising significantly enhances the accuracy of network-based nowcasting and forecasting.},

We prove the global stability of these equilibria under specific conditions and identify a necessary criterion for the coexistence equilibrium. We find conditions under which one product persists while the other fades away. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of an associated optimal control problem. We first prove the existence of an optimal control pair and then determine the system conditions necessary for this optimal control pair. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by fitting it to historical data on the daily active users of Facebook and Instagram. By calibrating the model with derived parameter values, we make predictions regarding the future user counts for both platforms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a deteriorating inventory model is developed with price dependent demand and time dependent holding cost in fuzzy environment. It is assumed that, deterioration does not start for a time period which is normal scenario in construction materials like cement. Shortages are allowed to happen and assumed to be partially backlogged. Investment in preservation technology is made to combat the effect of deterioration. Due to limited transportation capacity of the model, a transportation company is hired for delivering the materials. To neutralize the fluctuation in various types of costs in present economic conditions, crisp and fuzzy models are created. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal strategies of the inventory model such as minimizing the total cost and optimal order quantity. The model is validated through numerical experimentation along with the sensitivity analysis. Real life applications in terms of managerial insights are given for the proposed model.},

While previous studies have highlighted its benefits for students, there remains a gap in understanding how teachers can effectively implement it to promote students’ maker mindsets. To address this gap, we collaborated with four elementary STEM teachers engaged in a Lesson Study (LS) cycle. Our aim was to delve deeper into DTMP and analyze teachers' pedagogical practices in utilizing it. We conducted an analysis of a real classroom session, employing a hierarchical and nested coding scheme to assess the teachers' use of artifacts and questioning techniques. Our analysis uncovered three significant ways in which DT contributes to reframing ME provided by teachers engaged in the LS cycle: 1) utilizing DT process models to structure learning activities; 2) using DT toolkits to scaffold, visualize, and assess learning; 3) employing DT strategies to support questioning practices. Building on these findings, we developed practical recommendations to support teachers effectively implementing DTMP to develop students’ maker mindsets, bridging the theory-practice gap and enhancing student learning experiences.},

  abstract = {The analysis of binary outcomes and features, such as the effect of vaccination on health, often rely on 2  ×  2 contingency tables. However, confounding factors such as age or gender call for stratified analysis, by creating sub-tables, which is common in bioscience, epidemiological, and social research, as well as in meta-analyses. Traditional methods for testing associations across strata, such as the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, struggle with small sample sizes and heterogeneity of effects between strata. Exact tests can address these issues, but are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, the Gamma Approximation of Stratified Truncated Exact (GASTE) test is proposed. It approximates the exact statistic of the combination of p-values with discrete support, leveraging the gamma distribution to approximate the distribution of the test statistic under stratification, providing fast and accurate p-value calculations, even when effects vary between strata. The GASTE method maintains high statistical power and low type I error rates, outperforming traditional methods by offering more sensitive and reliable detection. It is computationally efficient and broadens the applicability of exact tests in research fields with stratified binary data. The GASTE method is demonstrated through two applications: an ecological study of Alpine plant associations and a 1973 case study on admissions at the University of California, Berkeley. The GASTE method offers substantial improvements over traditional approaches. The GASTE method is available as an open-source package at https://github.com/AlexandreWen/gaste.

  abstract = {Acid sphingomyelinases (aSMases) are enzymes involved in the repair of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. However, neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases) have also been shown to possess other roles in bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms, especially as virulence factors. These enzymes exhibit structural conservation but are characterized by elusive homology and the lack of sequence signatures or motifs. In a previous study, we reported the structural features of the complete set of sphingomyelinases (SMases) in Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis, showing structural homology and functional differences in two aSMases from E. histolytica (EhSMase). However, the approach was limited due to the AlphaFold3 source code not being publicly available at the time. In this report, the structural transitions in the aSMases from T. vaginalis (TvSMase) were measured using open-source AlphaFold3 and collective motions of proteins via Normal Mode Analysis in internal coordinates. They compared them with the models from aSMase4 (EHI_100080) and aSMase6 (EHI_125660) from E. histolytica, containing different combinations of ligands. Using full-length sphingomyelin and the Mg2+ and Co2+ ions, where Co2+ was shown to inhibit the enzymes of both organisms, we demonstrate that the enzymes exhibit limited flexibility and deformability, except for the T. vaginalis TVAG_271580 enzyme, which displays high structural deformability. This contrasts with the inhibitory mechanism elicited by Co2+ as shown previously. TVSMase3 (TVAG_222460) could not be modelled with the sphingomyelin in the active site pocket, suggesting a regulatory role rather than a functional active enzyme. Additional physicochemical parameters calculated for T. vaginalis enzymes suggest unstable structures and high internal mobility (estimated using the Internal Coordinate method), which may be associated with the functional role of these enzymes. The results presented here open an avenue for searching for novel inhibitors of aSMases that target their physical properties, which could potentially complement treatment to control the parasite burden. These inhibitors could be valuable for further studying the role of these enzymes in parasite pathobiology and, potentially, as therapeutic targets.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, creating substantial challenges for international healthcare. Medicinal and aromatic plants offer diverse pharmaceutical properties owing to their richness in chemical constituents. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of essential oil from Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), which demonstrated inhibitory potential, indicating its possible role in AD management. Preliminary phytochemical screening, followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, led to the identification of seventeen compounds, collectively accounting for 97.70 % of the total area, with patchouli alcohol (26.21 %) emerging as the predominant constituent. In-vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity tests revealed that sesquiterpene-rich patchouli essential oil had a lower (IC50 24.15 µg/mL) than the standard galantamine (IC50 25.66 µg/mL), highlighting the higher inhibition potential of patchouli essential oil on acetylcholinesterase. In-silico studies revealed that patchouli alcohol exhibited the highest binding affinity with a docking score of −8.5 kcal/mol, while 1H-Cycloprop[e]azulene, 1a,2,3,4,6,7,7a,7b-octahydro-1,1,4,7-tetramethyl showed the lowest docking score of −6.8 kcal/mol, highlighting the differential binding interactions of the compounds with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. All key compounds demonstrated acceptable ADME properties, including compliance with Lipinski's rule of five, favorable topological polar surface area (TPSA), high gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and suitable bioavailability scores. Molecular dynamics simulations (600 ns) confirmed stable AChE-ligand interactions (six complexes), with RMSD values of ∼2.5–3.5 Å, SASA around 2050–2200 Å², and Rg between 21.8 and 23.4 Å, indicating compact and stable protein-ligand complexes, indicating its potential as an AD therapeutic agent.},

  abstract = {Nearly all progressive renal disorders emerge through the renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) pathway, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed bioinformatics approaches to identify crucial targets and immune-infiltrating patterns in RIF. By screening the microarray datasets GSE22459 and GSE76882, we identified 163 and 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, with 80 core genes in common between RIF and healthy specimens. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified five hub genes—G protein-coupled receptor 18 (GPR18), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), and Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9). These were clustered into a functional group related to chemokine signaling, lymphocyte activation modulation, and leukocyte activation modulation. Immune cell infiltration analysis further revealed that the enrichment levels of 13 immune cell subtypes were significantly different in RIF samples, with Th1 cell enrichment being notably downregulated. To validate these computational findings, a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis model was established in mice. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining revealed that in UUO-induced mouse kidneys, the protein levels of GPR18, CCL5, CCR5, CCL19, and CXCL9 were remarkably elevated compared with the normal control. These results confirm the potential of these 5 hub genes as therapeutic targets in RIF. This study helps reveal the underlying mechanisms of RIF.},

In solvent medium, as synthesized TMP molecule preferably oriented in its keto form (ketonic TMP) or in enol form (enolic TMP) such a way that the keto form is predominant in polar medium and enol form in non-polar medium. Irrespective of high polarity, interestingly in aqueous solvent medium the leading single peak ketonic form converted slowly in real time into its enolic form through the water mediated intermolecular proton transfer procedure. In emission, ketonic TMP shows high fluorescence in its existing solvents for extended π conjugations whereas normal enolic TMP is non-fluorescent in protic solvents and very weekly fluorescent in aprotic solvents due to forbidden transitions. In water only, after a certain time of keto to enol conversion i.e. at low ketonic concentration, a bathochromic shift of low intense ketonic emission is identified as enolic emission after excited state proton transfer. As well, in aprotic solvents, weekly fluorescent enolic TMP twisted in such a way that a new fluorescence active twisted structural isomer is developed as the forbidden excited state enolic transition is wiped out in its twisted isomer. In addition to single ketonic emissive state, two different emissive states for enolic TMP in aprotic solvents are also clearly distinguished in lifetime analysis. A detailed density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have clearly demonstrated the energy levels of the tautomers in aqueous medium, and polarity dependent inter-convertible intramolecular proton transfer between keto-enol state in non-aqueous medium through potential energy curves or surfaces. Dihedral angle plot also show the existence of two stable enolic states in S0 and S1 potential curves as normal and twisted enolic TMP in aprotic solvents. Therefore, in this article, the synthesized TMP molecule with widely used fundamental moiety and having potential activity of various applications is exposed from all its fundamental properties and isomeric structures for future references.},

  abstract = {Cardiotoxicity remains a major clinical challenge associated with various environmental and chemotherapeutic toxicants. Sunitinib (SNB) is a potent targeted cancer drug that is reported to induce severe organ damage including renal failure. Cirsiliol (CSL) is a natural flavone that exhibits marvelous pharmacological properties. In this investigation, we explored the potential cardioprotective nature of CSL to counter SNB induced cardiac impairments. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 36) were categorized into control, SNB (25 mgkg−1), SNB (25 mgkg−1) + CSL (10 mgkg−1), and CSL (10 mgkg−1) alone experimented group. SNB exposure led to a notable reduction in the expression of Endothelin Receptor Type B (EDNRB), Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) while exacerbating the expression of P21, P53, Endothelin-1 (EDN-1), Endothelin Receptor Type A (EDNRA). The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were promoted while the enzymatic activities of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GSR), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) contents were reduced following the SNB exposure. Moreover, SNB intoxication led to a marked elevation in the concentrations of C-reactive protein, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), Pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide (ProBNP), troponin-T, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), troponin-I and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Cardiac tissues showed sever immune-inflammatory responses after SNB intoxication as confirmed by augmented levels and expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and total fraction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Furthermore, the SNB administration upregulated the concentrations of cysteine-aspartic proteases-9 (Caspase-9), cysteine-aspartic proteases-3 (Capase-3), and Bcl-2–associated X protein (Bax) while declining the concentration of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). SNB intoxication caused histological disarrays including myofibrillar degeneration, capillary dilation, wavy fibers, necrosis of focal regions, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, inflammation and interstitial edema. Nonetheless, CSL therapy notably reversed these pathological changes via upregulating SIRT1/FOXO3a and endothelin pathways while reducing cardiac inflammation, apoptosis and cardiac function markers. Our results are validated through in-silico which showed that CSL showed high binding affinity with key regulatory pathways.},

  abstract = {With rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI), the discussion about and applications of generative AI have increased substantially. Generative AI has extensive and valuable applications in many industrial and medical fields and is a possible solution for industries that struggle to collect large quantities of data. The present study evaluated the use of generative AI in eye disease prediction. Because retinal images are difficult to acquire, this study used a generative AI model [i.e., the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)] to conduct data augmentation, thereby improving the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed for eye disease detection. This study adopted the DDIM primarily for its high inference speed and ability to consistently generate high-quality samples in a limited number of steps, making it suitable for tasks that require high-quality medical images. With the increasing prevalence of electronic products, the number of patients with retinopathy or optic neuropathy is increasing annually, and patients are experiencing these diseases at increasingly younger ages. Moreover, eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration are becoming increasingly common in modern society. The developed CNN model exhibited a 3 % higher accuracy when it was trained using the data generated by the DDIM than when it was trained without these data. This CNN model can screen eye disease symptoms early to enable patients to receive timely treatment, thereby mitigating the risk and consequences of eye diseases. The results of this study indicate that the training data generated using the DDIM can enhance the accuracy of early eye disease detection.},

  abstract = {The impact of the steric bulk of the heteroaryl moiety on the hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene (HTIB)-mediated rearrangement of pyrazolyl chalcones under non-nucleophilic conditions is studied herein. The results demonstrate that the pyrazolyl group of chalcones readily undergoes a 1,2-heteroaryl migration upon treatment with HTIB in dichloromethane solvent. The product of the migration leads to the formation of a series of α-heteroaryl-β,β-ditosyloxy ketones. The structure of these ketones is fully characterized by spectral data (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR), single-crystal XRD and HRMS analysis. The molecular structure is further analysed in-depth in terms of the characteristics of frontier molecular orbitals, global descriptive parameters, molecular electrostatic potentials, Mulliken population analysis, Hirshfeld surface analysis and 3D-energy framework studies. Moreover, the synthetic utility of these α-heteroaryl-β,β-ditosyloxy ketones is also explored in the regioselective synthesis of five and six-membered heterocyclic compounds as a specimen reaction.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men worldwide and is driven in large part by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Upon sufficient androgenic concentration, the AR undergoes conformational changes and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of genes essential for tumor growth and progression. In this study, we performed a structure-based virtual screening of 34 phytochemicals from Euphorbia resinifera against the crystal structure of the AR ligand-binding domain (PDB ID: 1E3G). This screening identified two leading compounds, Resiniferatoxin and Euphol, both demonstrated favorable binding poses and docking scores of −10 kcal/mol and −8.6 kcal/mol, respectively, surpassing Flutamide, the standard antiandrogen (−7.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation showed that these two molecules formed stable complexes with AR, suggesting their potential utility as natural AR inhibitors in prostate cancer therapy. However, additional experimental studies are essential to validate their efficacy, elucidate their mechanisms of action, and assess their safety profiles, potentially paving the way for innovative plant-based treatments targeting AR-driven prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of molecular properties plays a crucial role in drug analysis and discovery. Especially for neurotherapeutic drugs developed for the treatment of neurological disorders, one of today's most critical challenges, this process becomes even more crucial. The prediction of the blood-brain barrier penetration (BBBP) ability of the molecules contained in the development process of a drug is the primary condition for knowing the effect of drugs on the central nervous system. In this study, we developed an innovative deep-learning architecture for predicting BBBP using well-characterised molecular properties. The new method, called XP-GCN (Extreme Parallel Graph Convolutional Network), combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to predict molecular properties. It achieves multidimensional feature fusion for BBBP prediction without relying on back-propagation algorithms. XP-GCN offers a comprehensive approach by combining graphical representations and molecular fingerprints while evaluating molecules through multidimensional analysis of SMILES strings, enhanced with data augmentation techniques. The model analyses various attributes of molecules through parallel GCN layers. Trained on a notably extensive molecular dataset compared to many literature studies, it has achieved high performance and computational efficiency by fusing information obtained from molecular fingerprints. Due to ELM's forward random weight and bias assignment features, the classification task without backpropagation-based training showed a classification performance of over 95 % in less than one millisecond, even in models with a low number of hidden neurons. XP-GCN, which shows a peak ROC-AUC performance of 0.9846 across different hyperparameters, offers a novel approach to molecular feature prediction with its computational efficiency, high accuracy, and classification capability. Furthermore, the robustness of the XP-GCN model has been demonstrated by Friedman and Nemenyi's post-hoc statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a significant public health issue that has a global impact. Significant mortality rates have already been observed due to this disease, and more mortalities are expected in the future. In recent times, there has been a growing interest among otolaryngologists and oncologists in the development of appropriate treatment regimens for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The primary objective of these treatment modalities is to extend the lifespan of patients following recurrence and enhance their overall survival and quality of life. For instance, metaheuristic algorithms (MH), a form of soft computing technology, are commonly utilized in healthcare data due to their effectiveness. Furthermore, metaheuristics rely on the evolutionary search principle. They direct the search process to effectively explore the search space in order to find near-optimal solutions for solving global optimization problems. Tabu search (TS) is a method used in optimization problems and falls under metaheuristic techniques. An essential element of TS is its utilization of adaptive memory, which enhances search efficiency by avoiding local optimality and promoting flexibility. Another example is data mining, which is a subset of artificial intelligence that utilizes data to extract meaningful information from previously unknown patterns. It has been increasingly used in healthcare to aid clinical diagnostics and disease prediction. The proposed technique treated data mining problems as combinatorial optimization problems and used metaheuristics to address data mining challenges, such as classification for unknown data and finding association rules for significant patterns. The Tabu Search Classifier Method (TSCM) outlined in this paper primarily utilizes the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm, enhanced with the incorporation of Dynamic Neighborhood Structure (DNHS), which contributes to better discovery of the search space. The TSCM algorithm identifies three rules based on the patients’ data and generates three precise artificial predictive models to determine and categorize individuals who are at risk of recurrent NPC. With each stage of the treatment, additional features become accessible. The first model relies on a primary data set that includes descriptive data. The second model incorporates more features than the first model but does not include the response feature. The third model utilizes all existing features and includes the response feature, which is observed three months after the treatment phase concludes, the third model is considered a post-treatment monitoring. This paper introduces an Artificial Advisory Healthcare System (AAHS) that utilizes these models to accurately predict the occurrence of recurrence during each stage of treatment and after the treatment as a post-treatment monitoring. This prediction enables the adjustment of the treatment plan and the implementation of additional measures in accordance with the system’s outputs. Given the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence in medical research, the proposed system aims to predict the likelihood of NPC recurrence in certain patients. Therefore, this will enable oncologists to take additional medical precautions to prevent recurrence and enhance their understanding of cancer. The experimental results indicate that the three proposed predictive models outperform the existing prognoses for NPC recurrence.},

The spatial distance between organic solvents and Phenol in the three-dimensional solubility space was calculated, and diethyl ether (DE) was used as a benchmark for preliminary screening. Further multi-dimensional optimization was performed by integrating ecotoxicity, physical properties (boiling point and viscosity), and environmental impacts (mutagenicity and bioaccumulation), ultimately identifying tetrahydrofuran (THF) and several ester solvents (MF, MA, EA) as potential back-extractants. Experimental verification showed that THF exhibited the best back-extraction performance, and the order of extraction efficiency (THF > MF > EA > MA > DE) was highly consistent with the calculation results of spatial distance and interaction energy. Mechanistic studies revealed that back-extraction efficiency mainly depends on hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic effects between the solvent and Phenol. After 3 cycles of experiments, THF still maintained high regeneration rate of DESs and high extraction rate of phenol, confirming the effectiveness and reliability of this screening method.},

In this study, we report the design and synthesize of new hybrids 4a–f, containing indolin-2-one, imidazo-isoxazole and phenoxyacetohydrazide systems, as promising antioxidant substances using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. All analogues were characterized using multispectroscopic techniques. Most of the newly synthesized derivatives demonstrated excellent to moderate antioxidant activities, especially 4b with IC50 value of 6.51 μM, 2.04 μM and 4.90 μM, followed by 4f displaying IC50 of 8.65 μM, 3.06 μM and 3.74 μM, against DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, respectively. The structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) study pointed out the effectiveness of substituted ring of the indolin-2-one moiety in enhancing the activity. Density functional theory (DFT) at the theoretical level of B3LYP/6–31(G) revealed that 4b was achieved the highest HOMO energy (–0.215 eV) and the lowest IP (0.215 eV), suggesting the strongest electron-donating ability, making it favorable for antioxidant action. In addition, 4f was emerged as a strong antioxidant candidate. Furthermore, molecular docking of the most potent ligand (4b) inside the active pocket of human cytochrome P450 (PDB:1OG5) and human carbonyl reductase-1(PDB:4Z3D) receptor enzymes suggest strong interactions. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation on 4b at 100 ns revealed stronger and more stable binding affinity toward target enzyme. Drug-likeness study suggested that the designed molecules hold suitable pharmacokinetic profiles. These findings envisage that these analogs appear as promising antioxidant drugs.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization has designated the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its variants as high-priority threats owing to their enhanced virulence and pathogenic potential. Staphyloxanthin (STX), a prominent virulence factor of S. aureus, plays a dual role: it shields the bacterium from oxidative stress generated by the host immune response and preserves the cell membrane integrity. Dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM), a prenyl transferase, is essential for catalyzing the first step of STX biosynthesis. In this study, we evaluated 144,000 compounds, including anticancer agents, inhibitors and approved drugs, and 3D bioactive molecules to inhibit the CrtM using computational approaches. Virtual screening was performed on the prepared compound library, followed by relative binding free energy calculations based on MM/GBSA for hit compounds and 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for top 3 hit candidates. BPH-652, a known CrtM inhibitor, was used as the reference. Our results revealed that Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 exhibit docking scores of −13.113 kcal/mol and −13.015 kcal/mol, respectively compared to BPH-652(-10.74 kcal/mol) against the CrtM. The stability was further confirmed with relative binding free energies of −57.70 kcal/mol for BPH-652, and −104.74 and −113.20 kcal/mol for Cmpd1 and Cmpd2, respectively. MD simulations demonstrated stable behavior of Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 inside active site of CrtM with minimal fluctuations, the binding energy calculated from MD trajectories also support strong affinity of these compounds. Their favorable ADME properties suggest the potential for further validation in in vitro and in vivo levels.},

  abstract = {Detecting neurological diseases is an important task in modern medicine, for which it is crucial to accurately model the temporal distributions of disease genesis. In prior methodologies, temporal patterns are used in feature effects and limiting assumptions such as proportionate risks. We introduce a new methodology for neural disease diagnosis, known as LSA-DGNet (Lightweight Self-Attention based on Deep Gated Network). LSA-DGNet utilizes a deep gated neural network module to model nonlinear and time-lagged effects of variables on disease outcomes. We combined multi-scale time-aware self-attention modules with scaled dot-product self-attention modules so that the parallel structures could provide an integrated self-attention mechanism to improve data perception. LSA-DGNet addresses both issues and, hence, sets a new benchmark for real-time, accurate detection of neurological diseases. Unlike existing approaches, LSA-DGNet integrates a lightweight multi-scale time-aware self-attention mechanism with deep gated neural networks, enabling improved modeling of temporal dependencies in noisy EEG data. This design allows for accurate and efficient detection of multiple neurological diseases, validated on five real-world datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. With up to 250 frames a second, it indicant large progress in computational efficiency—game-changer potential—and clinical applications. The entire framework opens up new opportunities for early diagnosis and more tailored treatment strategies and simply revolutionizes how neurological diseases are detected and treated.},

  abstract = {Dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease caused by four distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. The nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) plays a critical role in viral replication and modulation of host immune responses through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptor myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2). Despite its importance, the molecular interactions between NS1 and the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex remain incompletely characterized. In this study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate NS1 interactions from DENV1 and DENV2 with TLR4/MD2. DENV1-NS1 preferentially engages MD2 through extensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, while DENV2-NS1 exhibits stronger interactions with TLR4, forming distinct salt bridges and polar contacts. The wing and β-ladder domains from DENV1-NS1 receptor complex were identified as key interaction hotspots, with the Asn207 glycosylation site positioned at the NS1–MD2 interface, potentially mimicking LPS binding. MM-GBSA binding energy calculations validate these findings, showing MD2 as the main stabilizing partner for DENV1-NS1 and TLR4 for DENV2-NS1. Despite ∼72 % sequence identity, serotype-specific differences in binding geometry and domain engagement were observed, suggesting divergent mechanisms of receptor modulation. These computational results highlight the NS1–TLR4/MD2 interface as a critical site for immune interaction and support the rationale for serotype-specific therapeutic strategies targeting NS1-mediated receptor engagement, while experimental validation is necessary to confirm functional outcomes.},

The goal of this paper is to compute and analyze first and second order terms in that expansion, leading to the fourth order PDE and the third order boundary condition, correcting the classical Darcy model.

In particular, the CNFD method is carefully devised on the staggered spatial and temporal grid points to preserve the total charge of the system. We provide several numerical experiments that validate the second-order convergence of the FDTD methods, the conservation of total charge and energy, and the dependencies of the solutions on the model parameters. We also compare the differences between the solutions of the CSS equations and the Schrödinger equation.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, kernel-based approximation methods had achieved astonishing success in solving different problems in the field of science and engineering. However, when employing the direct or standard method of performing computations using infinitely smooth kernels, a conflict arises between the accuracy that can be theoretically attained and the numerical stability. In other words, when the shape parameter tends to zero, the operational matrix for the standard bases with infinitely smooth kernels become severely ill-conditioned. This conflict can be managed applying hybrid kernels. The hybrid kernels extend the approximation space and provide high flexibility to strike the best possible balance between accuracy and stability. In the current study, an innovative approach using hybrid radial kernels (HRKs) is provided to solve weakly singular Fredholm integral equations (WSFIEs) of the second kind in a meshless scheme. The approach employs hybrid kernels built on dispersed nodes as a basis within the discrete collocation technique. This method transforms the problem being studied into a linear system of algebraic equations. Also, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to calculate the optimal parameters for the hybrid kernels, which is based on minimizing the maximum absolute error (MAE). We also study the error estimate of the suggested scheme. Lastly, we assess the accuracy and validity of the hybrid technique by carrying out various numerical experiments. The numerical findings show that the estimates obtained from hybrid kernels are significantly more accurate in solving WSFIEs compared to pure kernels. Additionally, it was revealed that the hybrid bases remain stable across various values of the shape parameters.},

Our proposed approach relies on the technique Kapl and Vitrih (2021), which requires for the C s -smooth isogeometric spline space a degree at least p = 2 s + 1 on the entire multi-patch domain. Similar to Kapl and Vitrih (2021), the C s -smooth mixed degree and regularity spline space is generated as the span of basis functions that correspond to the individual patches, edges and vertices of the domain. The reduction of degrees of freedom for the functions in the interior of the patches is achieved by introducing an appropriate mixed degree and regularity underlying spline space over [ 0 , 1 ] 2 to define the functions on the single patches. We further extend our construction with a few examples to the class of bilinear-like G s multi-patch parameterizations (Kapl and Vitrih (2018); Kapl and Vitrih (2021)), which enables the design of multi-patch domains having curved boundaries and interfaces. Finally, the great potential of the C s -smooth mixed degree and regularity isogeometric spline space for performing isogeometric analysis is demonstrated by several numerical examples of solving two particular high order partial differential equations, namely the biharmonic and triharmonic equation, via the isogeometric Galerkin method.},

In this context, in silico methodologies facilitate the early-stage prediction of ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) and toxicity (ADME-Tox) parameters, reducing experimental costs and accelerating the screening of viable drug candidates. Computational approaches such as QSAR, SAR, and QSPR enable the assessment of biological activity and pharmacokinetic behavior. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the ADME(T) profiles of 58 organic compounds using computational tools, establish predictive models for toxicity, and assess inhibitory potential against the TLK2 kinase domain (PDB: 5O0Y)—a protein implicated in breast cancer and intellectual disability. Methodology Chemical structures were optimized using the MMFF94 force field. ADME-Tox descriptors—including Log P, Log S, Caco-2 permeability, CYP450 interactions, hERG inhibition, LD50, and DILI—were calculated using SwissADME and PreADMET. Data analysis included Pearson correlation, PCA, hierarchical clustering, and construction of a cosine similarity network. A Random Forest regression model was implemented to predict LD₅₀ values, and molecular docking simulations were conducted using PyRx and Discovery Studio. Results Correlation and PCA analyses revealed key trends, including a strong relationship between Log P and Log D, and groupings based on structural similarity. The Random Forest model demonstrated strong predictive performance for LD50 (r2 = 0.8410; RMSE = 0.1112), with five-fold cross-validation confirming robustness. Molecular docking identified several compounds with favorable binding affinities to TLK2, notably compound CC-43, which showed the strongest interaction (–8.2 kcal/mol) and a moderate theoretical toxicity profile (LD50 = 3.186). Conclusions The integration of ADME(T) profiling, machine learning, and molecular docking provides a comprehensive and reproducible computational strategy for drug discovery. The approach enabled the identification of compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and selective inhibitory potential, supporting compound CC-43 as a promising candidate for further exploration in breast cancer therapeutics.},

The satisfactorily correlations observed between the reaction rates and the oxidation potentials of the anilines provide compelling evidence for a single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. Nucleophilicity parameters (N, sN) were determined in methanol following Mayr's empirical eq. A particularly compelling finding of our study is the good correlation observed between the nucleophilicity parameters (N) of anilines 2a-2e measured in methanol and those reported by Mayr in acetonitrile, demonstrating the role of solvent polarity in nucleophilic reactivity. Utilizing this correlation and the established relationship between N and the Hammett constant (σp), we predicted N values for five additional 4-X-anilines 2f-2j (X = NO₂, CN, CF₃, F, and N(CH₃)₂). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) transition-state (TS) analyses provided activation free energies (ΔG≠) for each para-substituent (X = OH, OCH3, CH3, H, Cl), all confirmed by a single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate. The computed ΔG≠ values inversely correlate with N: electron-donating groups decrease, and electron-withdrawing groups increase the activation barrier. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explore relationships between N and various reactivity descriptors, including the global nucleophilicity index (ω−1), dipole moment (μ), polarizability (α), and hyperpolarizability (β) for the ten para-X-substituted anilines 2a-2j. The data reveal a clear structure–property framework for tuning the NLO response of substituted anilines. Molecules substituted with strong EWGs are superior candidates for NLO applications due to their high dipole moments, elevated polarizabilities, and exceptionally large hyperpolarizabilities.},

We identified transcriptionally dysregulated genes, generated pathway scoring matrices for four gene sets using GSVA, and incorporated mutation data (with network smoothing) to define subtypes. We successfully constructed three subtypes (PS1, PS2, and PS3) that exhibited distinct patterns in immune infiltration, biological pathway characteristics, and genomic instability. Among these, PS3 showed the worst prognosis and was more enriched in pathways related to cell proliferation. The higher silhouette coefficient confirmed the validity of the classification. Moreover, our analysis identified six subtype-specific drugs, such as KU_55933 and Cyclophosphamide, that were more sensitive to PS1. Screening the differential pathways, we identified nine core pathways and performed mutation profiling on the extension of telomeres pathway, successfully identifying three telomere-related biomarkers: POLD1, RFC1, and TERF1. Meanwhile, we constructed a nomogram with important clinical features and validated the subtype of independent prognostic significance. Finally, by integrating 15 machine learning algorithms, we established a reproducible classification model (NN_MLP_10: AUC = 0.930) based on 10 genes. In conclusion, this study successfully constructed and evaluated a pathway-based molecular subtype and classification model for HCC, thoroughly investigated the biological and multi-omics differences between subtypes. Additionally, the identification of three telomere-associated biomarkers offers guidance and a theoretical basis for personalized treatment and clinical use of drugs for HCC patients.},

  abstract = {Robot programming is an age-appropriate means to cultivate children's computational thinking (CT) and executive function (EF). Project-based learning (PBL) is commonly applied to teach robot programming. PBL involves complex, large-scale projects consisting of multiple sub-projects. Each sub-project introduces new knowledge but offers few opportunities to connect it with previously learned knowledge, thus misaligning with children's cognitive development. In comparison, incremental PBL (IPBL) is a tailored design of PBL that begins with basic knowledge, with each new sub-project building on all learned knowledge from previous sub-projects and progressively adding new knowledge to achieve complete project learning. Hence, this research integrated IPBL into robot programming to develop an incremental project-based robot programming (I-PBRP) approach, and evaluated its effect on young children's CT, EF, and learning behavioral patterns. Ninety-five children aged 5–6 engaged in 12-week interventions. They were randomly assigned to the I-PBRP group and the conventional project-based robot programming (C-PBRP) group. Results manifested that the I-PBRP group achieved better performance than the C-PBRP group in CT and in the three components of EF (inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) over time. The progressive behavioral analysis manifested that the I-PBRP approach promoted superior performance in robot programming activities and more positive learning behaviors for children. This research has implications for robot programming teaching approaches for young children's CT and EF development.},

The EMs were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic techniques and thermogravimetric analysis. A high-dipole-moment EM (C12) was selected for non-covalent functionalization of GO. DFT results highlighted significant optimization energy and dipole moment in the GO-EM composite. Electrochemical studies showed the compostie, GO-EM has enhanced sensing ability towards dinotefuran , demonstrating reduced dipole moment and optimization energy. The low LOD (5.6 µM) highlights the high sensitivity of the GO-EM electrode for dinotefuran detection.

  abstract = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major global health challenge, especially in Asia, due to its high incidence, mortality and poor prognosis. As there are no reliable early - diagnosis biomarkers, ESCC is often detected at an advanced stage, when radiotherapy becomes the main treatment. However, the emergence of radioresistance significantly compromises treatment efficacy, leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Although some research has been done on the mechanisms of ESCC radiation resistance, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap and identify more molecular targets for overcoming radiation resistance, we established a radioresistant ESCC cell model and conducted systematic 4D label-free proteomic profiling. Quantitative analysis revealed 364 differentially expressed proteins, predominantly enriched in nucleotide excision repair, glutathione metabolism, and insulin resistance pathways. Functional validation identified TXNDC12 as a critical regulator of radioresistance, and its overexpression is significantly associated with enhanced glutathione synthesis and intracellular ROS scavenging. This study provides the first proteomic evidence linking redox homeostasis modulation through TXNDC12-GSH axis activation to ESCC radioresistance, offering novel therapeutic targets for overcoming radiation resistance and improving clinical outcomes in advanced ESCC management.},

First, we improved the YOLOv8 model by integrating the Online Convolutional Reparameterization (OREPA) module, achieving a 93.09 % sensitivity for detecting abnormal cells.

Most industrial environments still operate with expensive, rigid and less flexibly monitoring systems. These systems are often difficult to scale and cannot adapt to rapidly changing operational needs.

In this study, we made use of open-source drug response data from cancer cell lines, in conjunction with KEGG pathway information, to develop sparse neural networks, K-net, enabling the prediction of drug response in EGFR signaling pathways and the identification of key biomarkers. To explore the rationality of identified biomarkers, we analyzed distribution patterns between drug-resistant and sensitive cell lines and performed simulated perturbation analysis on drug response. We compared K-net with commonly used interpretable algorithms in biomarker identification, such as lasso logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Our results suggested that K-net outperformed other algorithms in identifying key biomarkers linked to osimertinib response, such as KRAS and TP53 mutations, as well as AKT3 overexpression, accurately revealing their associations with osimertinib resistance. Moreover, K-net revealed subtype-specific top biomarkers for osimertinib resistance, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showing a predisposition to KRAS mutations and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibiting AKT3 overexpression. Our study revealed that K-net was able to precisely identify critical biomarkers linked to drug responses, highlighting the potential to facilitate optimization of cancer treatment strategies.},

Publicly available GEO datasets, viz., GSE226146 (PCOS), GSE18520 (OC), and GSE125664 (MDD), were analyzed, which in total resulted in 21,366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 11,174 upregulated and 10,198 downregulated genes. Common genes PTTG1 and PID1 were identified using Venny 2.0. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING, and 10 hub genes (ANAPC5, ANAPC2, PTTG1, FZR1, ANAPC4, CDC20, CDC27, ANAPC10, UBE2C, and BUB1) were identified using CytoHubba based on MCC scoring. Functional enrichment analysis showed significant involvement of these genes in oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, mitotic regulation, and metaphase-anaphase transition (p < 0.05). PTTG1, identified as both a common and hub gene, was downregulated in PCOS and upregulated in OC and MDD. Drug-gene interaction analysis using DSigDB via Enrichr identified Alvespimycin (for PCOS) and Gefitinib (for OC) as drugs targeting PTTG1. Molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2.6 showed that Alvespimycin and Ephedrone bind PTTG1 with a binding affinity of − 4.59 kcal/mol and − 5.81 kcal/mol, respectively, while Gefitinib showed − 4.92 kcal/mol, slightly less than Troglitazone (-5.3 kcal/mol) for OC. This study highlights PTTG1 as a shared molecular link among PCOS, OC, and MDD, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and providing insights into the genetic and physiological overlap of these conditions.},

                  The study aimed to investigate the classification performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing connective tissue diseases(CTD). This was done by analyzing laboratory data, including additional markers, in patients who tested positive for antinuclear antibody(ANA).
               
                  Material/Methods
                  The research included 663 ANA-positive patients. An automated machine learning approach, specifically Auto-Weka, was used to classify these patients based on 75 features, including age, sex, and various laboratory tests.
               
                  Results
                  The Bayes Network achieved the highest overall performance with 93.1 % accuracy, 77.7 % sensitivity, and 96.0 % specificity in the classification of all patients. The most successful models were Locally Weighted Learning for systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE), with an accuracy of 93.4 %; Logistic Model Trees for primary Sjogren's syndrome(pSS), with an accuracy of 91.4 %; AdaBoostM for rheumatoid arthritis(RA), with an accuracy of 95.2 %; and Sequential Minimal Optimization for systemic sclerosis(SSc), with an accuracy of 92.0 %. Sensitivity and specificity rates for SLE, pSS, RA and SSc were found to be 69.4 %, 72.0 %, 78.5 %, 75.3 % and 98.7 %, 96.2 %, 98.9 %, 94.9 %, respectively. The area under the ROC curve in the general distribution of the groups was 95.6 %, the highest value in distinguishing was 99.1 % for RA and the lowest was 85.1 % for SSc. The most predictive markers identified were hematocrit for SLE, anti-SSA for pSS, rheumatoid factor for RA, and anti-centromere B positivity for SSc.
               
                  Conclusion
                  AI models are highly successful in classifying ANA-positive patients with great accuracy. AI-based approaches have the potential to assist clinicians in diagnosing autoimmune diseases by providing more accurate and faster results.},

To further improve prediction accuracy and shorten the development cycle of new proteins, we integrate protein sequences, mutation relationships, and physicochemical properties for encoding, introducing the innovative Sparse Convolutional Network driven by the self-attention mechanism, named SCSAddG. Experimental results demonstrate that SCSAddG achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.868, a precision of 0.710, a recall of 0.606, an F1 score of 0.653, and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.825 in the general dataset S2648. Compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), SCSAddG exhibits slightly higher prediction accuracy and outperforms the Rosetta bioinformatics simulation software 12% in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, in the experimental transglutaminase dataset, SCSAddG exhibits significantly better prediction accuracy compared to CNN (0.744 vs. 0.667), achieving a precision of 1.000. The results of wet laboratory experiments are consistent with the model predictions. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the SCSAddG model outperformed the CNN across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating its superior predictive performance and robust reliability. These results indicate that SCSAddG can effectively evaluate the trends in protein thermostability and serve as a valuable tool to guide protein thermostability engineering.},

  abstract = {The use of emerging micropollutants (EMPs) such as pesticides has raised numerous concerns and problems in the lives of humans and other living organisms. The entry of these pollutants into the environment through agricultural pesticides and subsequent water pollution has prompted mankind to separate these micropollutants from water using extraction methods. For this purpose, the green solvent extraction method is effective in this field. By using green solvents, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), the intermolecular interactions between these solvents and micropollutants can be investigated, and a new green solvent for separation can be proposed. In pursuit of this goal, in this paper, the extraction of 4 newly discovered micropollutants from water such as acetamiprid (Acet), imidacloprid (Imid), nitenpyram (Nite) and thiamethoxam (Thia) using a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (HDES, made of components with low water solubility for easy and good separation of micropollutants) consisting of thymol (Thy) and caprylic acid (Cap; C8) with a molar ratio of 2:3 from the aqueous phase, either as a mixture of micropollutants or individually, was simulated and structural and dynamic analyses including RDF, SDF, CDF, H-bonding, non-bonding energies showed encouraging results. Also, the formation of hydrogen bonds between HBA and HBD was identified and confirmed using 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. To understand the selectivity of adsorption (solubility) and diffusion of pesticides in eutectic mixtures, the effect of intermolecular interactions on dynamic properties at 298 K was investigated. The results revealed strong interactions between pesticides and DES compounds (high extraction efficiency), and two pollutants, Imid and Acet, were separated by green solvent more than Nite and Thia. In this way, the relative stability coefficient was also investigated and confirmed (DES with high stability (S = 3.94) that can be used in the separation of different types of pollutants). Properties such as σ profiles, σ potential, activity coefficient, partition coefficient, and LLE in the COSMO-RS model were calculated. The efficiency of the selected solvent in the micropollutants extraction was confirmed. This work, with a new approach to the extraction of insecticides, firstly introduces a DES that has not been reported for the extraction of such insecticides so far. Secondly, with an integrated computational strategy combining MD and COSMO-RS, elucidating the extraction mechanism at the molecular level, it allows for valuable predictions that significantly reduce the experimental costs.},

Although neutronic calculations of block type HTGRs are quite straight forward, thermal–hydraulic calculations are challenging due to complex heat transfer mechanism in the core. In addition, if high fidelity is applied, the computational power and time requirement is quite high. The high fidelity, loose, and explicit coupling multi-physics approach with Monte Carlo and computational fluid dynamics codes was proposed in this study that minimizes the computational power need without losing accuracy. The proposed methodology was tested with Holos Quad Core microreactor. The calculations showed that both neutronic and thermal–hydraulic simulation results of the proposed methodology are within 4% difference level with the results given for Holos microreactor therefore showing the proposed methodology’s reliability.},

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are key mediators of angiogenesis, sustaining tumor growth and progression. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising gene-silencing strategy for targeted cancer therapy. In this study, we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against VEGF mRNA using computational approaches. VEGF gene sequences were retrieved from NCBI, and siRNAs were designed using siDirect v2.0 and i-Score Designer. Candidate siRNAs were screened based on GC content (30–52 %), secondary structure, and thermodynamic stability. Hybridization energy analysis revealed favourable binding to VEGF mRNA, ranging from –31.1 to –37.3 kcal/mol. Molecular docking with h-Argonaute-2 (h-Ago2) yielded docking scores between –330 and –351 kcal/mol, indicating efficient RISC loading. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated stable siRNA–Ago2 complexes, with RMSD values stabilizing around 2.1–2.6 Å and RMSF fluctuations primarily localized to the PAZ and MID domains. These findings confirm strong binding affinity, structural stability, and specificity of the designed siRNAs. Overall, our results suggest that RNAi-based silencing of VEGF holds significant potential as a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting angiogenesis in breast cancer.},

Tideglusib is a drug which is under second phase of clinical trial (NCT01350362), impedes the GSK-3β at therapeutically concentration that has been established through various in silico techniques like scaffold morphing, pharmacokinetic, molecular docking and dynamic simulations studies. The Tideglusib based analogues showed good interactions with the catalytic dyed residue (Cys199) of GSK-3β GSK-3β, the main amino acid responsible for its tau hyperphosphorylation activity. Also, the designed analogues of Tideglusib are analyzed for its Multi targeting potential with three main receptors (GSK-3β, AChE, BACE) through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation approaches. SG-09 stands out with the best binding affinity and the stable ligand-protein interaction analogues in the time interval of 100 ns can be used as Multitargeting drug with further in silico, in vitro and in vivo clinical evaluation.

Through established medicinal chemistry synthetic methods, these compounds were successfully prepared and their structures confirmed using detailed spectroscopic analyses, including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), and multinuclear NMR (¹H and ¹³C). In vitro screening, nine candidates (2, 3, 9, 10, 11a, 11d, 11e, 12a, and 12b) assessed their XO inhibitory activity, ability to prevent protein denaturation, and capability to stabilize erythrocyte membranes. Notably, compound 12b emerged as the most promising agent, displaying superior XO inhibition (IC₅₀ = 2.8 μM), effective protein denaturation suppression (89.4% at 100 μg/mL), and significant reduction in hemolysis (92.1% efficacy), surpassing standard drugs like allopurinol and diclofenac. Molecular docking simulations indicated strong binding between the compounds and the XO active site, with 12b showing optimal interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. These computational results were consistent with experimental outcomes, suggesting a mechanism of competitive inhibition. The overall findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 12b as a leading candidate for gout management, providing a foundation for further optimization in developing advanced XO inhibitors with improved efficacy and selectivity.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play key roles in the development of various diseases and drug responses, and mining their potential association with drugs is of great significance in unraveling disease mechanisms and discovering new therapeutic targets. However, traditional hypergraph methods typically rely on a static composition strategy, which makes it challenging to dynamically adjust the structure according to the task, resulting in a limited ability to extract higher-order information. Accordingly, we present a learnable hypergraph reconstruction (LHRCDA) approach for predicting circRNA–drug sensitivity associations. Specifically, the hypergraph representation is initialized based on matrix decomposition, followed by a learnable hypergraph reconstruction mechanism to adaptively capture potential higher-order structural information. After reconstruction, a hierarchical hypergraph mapping approach encodes the hypergraph at multiple levels, thereby further enhancing the ability to model complex nonlinear interactions between hyperedges. To effectively integrate different view representations from heterogeneous graph and hypergraph views, we adopt a hierarchical perceptual fusion strategy that solves the problem of information redundancy or loss that exists in traditional single fusion methods. Ultimately, the fused node representations are nonlinearly mapped using an MLP to output the association probabilities between circRNAs and drugs. Experimental results show that the hypergraph approach based on higher-order structural modeling outperforms multiple existing state-of-the-art models in circRNA–drug sensitivity association prediction. In addition, case studies were conducted on the drugs vorinostat and cetuximab, further demonstrating the potential of our model as an efficient and reliable tool.},

Transport proteins are expected to play a crucial role in the influx of essential nutrients to sustain the parasite’s rapid growth. Unfortunately, the T. parva transportome is still not comprehensively elucidated, and plagued by the presence of uncharacterized proteins. In this study, we employed a combination of approaches including sequence orthology and structural similarity to identify 188 proteins predicted to be involved in transport-related processes. Among these, 24 were uncharacterized proteins, and 17 of them could be assigned a tentative annotation. Furthermore, the localization of these 188 proteins was investigated, resulting in their assignment to seven cellular compartments. Screening of the proteomes of other Theileria species, T. annulata, T. orientalis, and T. equi revealed that all 188 proteins were present in both transforming and non-transforming Theileria parasites. Among the 188 potential transport-related proteins, 45 were associated with transmembrane transport and most of them (87 %) are conserved across phylum Apicomplexa.},

However, existing methods often overlook variations in data quality across omics, leading to unreliable feature representations. To address this issue, we propose scUCAF, an uncertainty-aware network for multi-omics clustering. Specifically, to mitigate the impact of noise on cell feature extraction, we introduce a variational autoencoder with a negative binomial distribution. After extracting each omics feature, we propose a high-confidence cluster-guided contrastive learning method to ensure cross-omics feature consistency. Finally, an uncertainty-aware fusion and gating network dynamically integrates the omics features to mitigate biases from low-quality data and produce reliable cell representations for clustering. Clustering results on eight real single-cell multi-omics datasets demonstrate that scUCAF outperforms existing multi-omics clustering methods. We also conduct downstream analyses to validate the effectiveness of scUCAF for cell type annotation and biomarker identification in liver cancer.},

  abstract = {Predicting protein function is a key challenge in computational biology with broad implications for understanding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Traditional deep learning approaches rely heavily on protein sequence data and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks, often neglecting structural information due to limited availability of experimentally resolved protein structures. The advent of AlphaFold, which predicts protein structures with near-atomic accuracy, provides an opportunity to integrate structural context into function prediction. In this study, we propose StructSeq2GO, a novel hybrid model that combines structural and sequence information. StructSeq2GO employs graph representation learning to extract structural features from AlphaFold-predicted protein structures and integrates them with sequence embeddings derived from the ProteinBERT language model to predict Gene Ontology (GO) labels. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that StructSeq2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance across three GO domains, with

These results highlight the critical importance of structural information and the efficacy of ProteinBERT in enhancing protein function prediction, as structure provides spatial and biochemical context not captured by sequence alone. The model’s performance is influenced by the quality of AlphaFold structural predictions and may benefit from future improvements in structure confidence modeling. Additionally, extending StructSeq2GO to predict pathway-level or disease-related annotations could broaden its biological utility.},

  abstract = {It is known that Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the highest number of deaths due to primary liver cancer and is one of the leading global oncology cases. Currently, in spite of many other efforts to improve the treatment, the prognosis is rather poor with HCC patients, indicating the necessity of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we undertook a multi-omics approach including exome sequencing, GO analysis, PPI network analysis, bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and Venn and survival analysis to search decisively for drivers of liver cancer. Our investigation focused on revealing particular somatic mutations in genes implicated in various fundamental processes of cellular biology. In view of this barrier, we were then able to single out FN1, JUN, H3C12, HSPA5, and FOS among all components at the molecular landscape of HCC, where the levels of expression in turn related to patient survival. The formal HSPA5 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 5) gene is a molecular chaperone participates in the unfolded protein response and transcriptional endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was highly elevated in HCC tissues. Bulk RNA-seq confirmed the overexpression of HSPA5, while single-cell RNA-seq showed the higher expression of this protein in some populations of tumor cells attesting to its importance during HCC progression at a cellular level. Meanwhile, spatial transcriptomics reinforced these results with more precise data, showing where inside the tumor microenvironment HSPA5 is highlighted. In addition, PPI analysis showed much interaction of the proteins identified, bringing emphasis on their functions in HCC. Increased HSPA5 expression levels are linked with low overall survival rates and so it raised the prospect of being a diagnostic tool. Thus, HSPA5 shows promise as a cancer biomarker as well as a target therapeutic agent for HCC and hence detailed studies on its role in liver cancer and application in precision medicine for better outcome of patients need to be carried out.},

This study introduces an integrated computer-aided drug design (CADD) framework that combines Monte Carlo–optimized QSAR modeling, molecular docking, and in silico pharmacokinetic assessment to identify dual c-Met/β-tubulin inhibitors with potential anti-TNBC activity. Robust conformation-independent QSAR models were developed using SMILES- and graph-based descriptors, achieving high internal consistency (R² > 0.84) and strong external predictivity (Q²ext > 0.77). Statistical validation and the CORAL-based “defect-of-correlation” approach confirmed reliability within the defined applicability domain. Fragment-level interpretation revealed molecular motifs associated with enhanced cytotoxicity, which were subsequently used in the CADD design of new multitarget analogs, enabling rational structure–activity relationship (SAR) refinement. Molecular docking against both c-Met and β-tubulin demonstrated complementary binding orientations and stable non-covalent interactions, supporting the proposed multitarget mechanism. In silico pharmacokinetic analysis indicated favorable drug-likeness, high gastrointestinal absorption, absence of major metabolic liabilities, and low predicted toxicity, suggesting a well-balanced safety–efficacy profile. Collectively, this study establishes a CADD-based multitarget modeling platform that integrates predictive, mechanistic, and pharmacokinetic insights, providing a rational foundation for the development of next-generation personalized therapeutics for TNBC.},

  abstract = {This study proposes an efficient approach for nonlinear optimal control problems governed by variable-order fractional integro-differential equation. The presented approach is based on transformation of the main problem to solving system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The offered computational method is established upon the Dickson polynomials and their properties. Through the way, a new operational matrix of Caputo variable-order fractional derivative is derived for the mentioned polynomials. More precisely, the state and control variables are expanded in components of the Dickson polynomials with undetermined coefficients. Then, these expansions are substituted in the cost functional and the fractional dynamical system. Consequently, the procedure of the constrained extremum problem supported by the collocation method is utilized to extract some nonlinear algebraic equations from the transformation of the desired optimal control problem by a set of unknown Lagrange multipliers. One of the key points of this method is to proving the convergence analysis and error bound of its solution. The precision of the proposed approach is examined through three various types of test examples. The obtained results indicate the superiority of the proposed method and confirm the standard criteria with theoretically accurate results.},

  abstract = {Gelatin, a biopolymer derived from collagen, is extensively employed in biomedical and food applications due to its biocompatibility and gel-forming properties. However, its physicochemical behavior is highly dependent on structural state, being a function of amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution, and processing conditions. The formation of polyelectrolyte complexes with polysaccharides, such as carrageenans, can significantly alter gelatin’s conformational stability and functional performance. In this work, we investigated the interactions between fish gelatin and sulfated polysaccharides carrageenans (κ-, ι-, and λ-types) at the molecular level using integrated computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to analyze the effect of carrageenan type, length, and charge on the structure and stability of polysaccharide-gelatin complexes, as well as on the dynamics and stability of gelatin molecule at acidic and neutral pH. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of the interaction of fish gelatin with all three types of carrageenans (k-, k- and λ-) at the molecular level and shows for the first time that carrageenans can form complexes with gelatin molecules of different stoichiometry (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 carrageenan: gelatin). The complementary zeta potential analysis confirmed the pH-dependent charge neutralization upon complexation, supporting the MD-predicted electrostatic-driven association. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated microstructural reorganization in composite gels as a result of strong carrageenan-gelatin interaction. These findings have highlighted the critical role of molecular structure and electrostatic complementarity in gelatin-carrageenan hydrogels and contribute to the rational design of gelatin-based gel systems with desired properties.},

This study investigated how adaptive metacognitive scaffolding (AMS) and planned metacognitive scaffolding (PMS) influenced elementary students’ CT in a GAI–supported programming environment. 74 students were assigned to AMS, PMS, or control conditions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined CT task performance, CT skill use, metacognitive regulation, and cognitive load through standardized assessments, programming artifacts, discourse logs, video-coded behaviors, classroom observation records, cognitive load ratings. Results showed that AMS significantly enhanced contextualized CT performance and promoted more complex, diverse skill use compared to PMS and control groups. AMS also fostered more recursive metacognitive behaviors and reduced mental efforts, while PMS supported higher meaningful engagement. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive scaffolding powered by GAI to support CT development in elementary programming education.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference relies on the posterior distribution, which is often estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. The sampler produces a dependent stream of variates from the limiting distribution of the Markov chain, the posterior distribution. When one wishes to display the estimated posterior density, a natural choice is the histogram. However, abundant literature has shown that the kernel density estimator is more accurate than the histogram in terms of mean integrated squared error for an i.i.d. sample. With this as motivation, a kernel density estimation method is proposed that is appropriate for the dependence in the Markov chain Monte Carlo output. To account for the dependence, the cross-validation criterion is modified to select the bandwidth in standard kernel density estimation approaches. A data-driven adjustment to the biased cross-validation method is suggested with introducing the integrated autocorrelation time of the kernel. The convergence of the modified bandwidth to the optimal bandwidth is shown by adapting theorems from the time series literature. Simulation studies show that the proposed method finds the bandwidth close to the optimal value, while standard methods lead to smaller bandwidths under Markov chain samples and hence to undersmoothed density estimates. A study with real data shows that the proposed method has a considerably smaller integrated mean squared error than standard methods. The R package KDEmcmc to implement the suggested algorithm is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

Simulations were validated against experimental reflectance data. They revealed that small-pore IOs strongly absorb in the UV-C and UV-B regions due to the slow photon effect, making them ideal for sterilization and water disinfection. Medium- and large-pore IOs benefit from additional slow photon effect at the 2nd order photonic band gap, enhancing absorption across both UV and visible regions. Medium-pore IOs are suited for indoor air treatment and water purification, while large-pore IOs with the highest photon flux enhancement enable solar-driven photocatalysis such as outdoor pollutant removal and hydrogen production. For all tested IO designs, the absorbed photon flux exceeds that of equivalent planar slabs, highlighting the advantage of photonic structuring for sustainable photocatalytic applications.},

Despite their engineering significance, traditional numerical schemes for these systems face strict CFL (≤1.0) constraints, limiting computational efficiency. This study addresses the computational challenges posed by geometric source terms in Euler equations governing compressible nozzle flows. The proposed approach decomposes the governing equations into convective and source components: while convection is resolved via an LTS Godunov scheme, geometric source terms—arising from nozzle area variations (quasi-1D) or cylindrical coordinate transformations (2D axisymmetric)—are discretized using a novel combination of explicit and exact schemes. Numerical validations include: (1) quasi-1D cases under supersonic start/non-start conditions (internal shocks near outlets) at CFL ≤8.0, demonstrating shock-capturing accuracy with 55 % RMS error reduction at CFL = 8.0; (2) 2D hypersonic nozzle flows (Mach 4.0 design), achieving stable simulations at CFL = 5.0 with <1 % exit Mach deviation and 66 % runtime reduction. Results confirm that the proposed LTS framework overcomes CFL ≤1.0 limitations while enhancing efficiency—computational costs and errors decrease monotonically with increasing CFL numbers. This method establishes a generalizable paradigm for stiff, multidimensional Euler systems, balancing robustness and accuracy without sacrificing explicit computation advantages.},

Next, we apply financial market concepts such as the self-financing portfolio and the no-arbitrage theorem to derive a partial differential equation (PDE) for evaluating the option price. The structure of the PDE is complex, so to solve it, we employ a spectral collocation method based on Pell-Lucas polynomials as basis functions. Since the coefficients of the governing PDE are variable, the collocation method offers several advantages over the Galerkin and Tau methods. To implement this approach, we compute the operational matrix of Pell-Lucas polynomials and approximate the first, second, and mixed partial derivatives of the model. By collocating the equation, we obtain a system of algebraic equations that can be solved using traditional numerical methods.},

The rise of drug-resistant TB has complicated treatment, while traditional diagnostic methods face limitations in speed, cost, and accuracy. This study explores machine learning (ML) models to predict drug resistance from genomic variants, offering a faster and more comprehensive solution.
                  We compiled a comprehensive dataset of variations and mutations associated with resistance phenotypes from databases such as TBDReaMDB, GMTV, WHO, and CARD. For each mutation, both sequence-based features (e.g., physicochemical property changes, Provean scores) and structure-based features (e.g., hydrophobicity, flexibility, accessible surface area) were derived. Ensemble ML models (Stacking, Bagging and Voting Classifiers) were evaluated for their ability to predict resistance to key anti-TB drugs: Fluoroquinolones, Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Pyrazinamide.
                  Results achieved indicated that the model behaved differently on six TB resistance genes (gyrA, gyrB, inhA, katG, rpoB, pncA), with accuracy varying from 66 % (gyrA Stacking) to 91.37% (pncA Voting) and ROC scores varying from 0.69 (gyrA Bagging) to 0.92 (pncA Stacking). The Bagging model performed best for gyrA, gyrB and rpoB with strong classification, while the Stacking classifier performed well for inhA. Voting classifier proved to be the top-performing classifier for katG and pncA gene. The top-performing model for both genes was chosen, emphasizing a gene-specific strategy to maximize resistance prediction.
                  This study demonstrates that gene-specific ensemble models, supported by a comprehensive feature set, can provide valuable predictions of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis. While promising, the findings remain a proof-of-concept and require further validation on larger and more diverse clinical datasets before clinical application.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent partial differential equations are a significant class of equations that describe the evolution of various physical phenomena over time. One of the open problems in scientific computing is predicting the behavior of the solution outside the given temporal region. Most traditional numerical methods are applied to a given time–space region and can only accurately approximate the solution of the given region. To address this problem, many deep learning-based methods, basically data-driven and data-free approaches, have been developed to solve these problems. However, most data-driven methods require a large amount of data, which consumes significant computational resources and fails to utilize all the necessary information embedded underlying the partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, data-free approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) may not be that ideal in practice, as traditional PINNs, which primarily rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tend to overlook the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in real-world physical systems. We propose a method denoted by PhysicsSolver that merges the strengths of two approaches: data-free methods that can learn the intrinsic properties of physical systems without using data, and data-driven methods, which are effective at making predictions. Extensive numerical experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method. We provide the code at https://github.com/PhysicsSolver.},

This study aimed to identify druggable allosteric site in E2 and screen approved sulfonamide drugs as potential repurposing candidates. Computational analysis revealed a novel druggable cavity between domains A and B of E2, distinct from previously reported sites. Virtual screening of sulfonamide drug libraries using consensus scoring identified bosentan as the top candidate, demonstrating superior binding affinity, favorable bioavailability, low toxicity and established antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Molecular dynamics simulations validated bosentan's stability within the allosteric site, with real-time hydrogen bond analysis revealing sustained interactions with key residues Phe141, Ile136, Ser143 and Arg104, supported by hydrophobic contacts and sulfur-aromatic interactions. These findings suggest bosentan's potential as a CHIKV inhibitor through allosteric modulation of E2 function. The study demonstrates the viability of targeting allosteric sites in CHIKV E2 and prioritizes bosentan for experimental validation as a repurposed antiviral therapy.},

  abstract = {Accurate prognostic stratification is essential for optimizing postoperative therapeutic strategies in oncology. While deep learning approaches have shown promise for survival prediction through unimodal analyses of histopathological images, transcriptomic profiles, and microbial signatures, their clinical utility remains limited due to fragmented biological insights. In this study, we introduce HMTsurv, a multimodal survival prediction framework that integrates digital histopathology, host transcriptomics, and tumor-associated microbiome features. Utilizing multi-omics datasets from four major malignancies—colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular, and breast cancers—our model exhibited superior prognostic accuracy (c-index: 0.68–0.72) when compared to single-modality benchmarks, as validated through rigorous cross-validation methods. Notably, our model achieved robust risk stratification (log-rank p < 0.001 across all cohorts) as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, effectively distinguishing patients into distinct survival trajectories. Systematic examination of multimodal signatures identified 14 pan-cancer survival biomarkers, including MAGE family genes, which were consistently upregulated in high-risk subgroups. Additionally, we elucidated distinct histopathological patterns, dysregulated microbial communities, and altered gene-microbiota co-expression networks that were predictive of adverse outcomes. This study not only establishes a generalizable multimodal architecture for cancer prognosis but also elucidates the intricate interactions among histological, molecular, and ecological determinants of survival, providing a clinically actionable framework for precision oncology.},

  abstract = {Purpose
                  This study investigates the causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) composition and myopia development through genetic instruments, aiming to identify specific microbial taxa with therapeutic potential and elucidate their underlying biological pathways.
               
                  Methods
                  We performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary statistics from GWAS of 473 GM taxa (n = 5959) and myopia (26,184 cases). Inverse variance weighted (IVW) and four complementary methods assessed causality (F-statistics>10), with sensitivity analyses to validate robustness. Biological annotation integrates protein-protein interaction networks and pathway enrichment to decode mechanisms.
               
                  Results
                  Our inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis identified 15 microbial features exhibiting causal associations with myopia (FDR < 0.05). Protective taxa included Family Dysgonomonadaceae (OR = 0.947, 95 % CI: 0.910–0.986) and species Megamonas funiformis (OR = 0.979, 0.964–0.995), while risk-associated taxa comprised Class Omnitrophota (OR = 1.144, 1.022–1.280) and species Bacillus velezensis (OR = 1.072, 1.017–1.129). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness through nonsignificant heterogeneity (Q > 0.05), absence of horizontal pleiotropy (Egger intercept P > 0.1), and no influential outliers (MR-PRESSO P > 0.3). Host genetic variants were significantly enriched in PI3K-Akt (P = 9.4 ×10⁻⁵) and Ras signaling pathways (P = 3.7 ×10⁻³). Three hub genes (PIK3R1, KITLG, and IL2RB) may mediate scleral pathogenesis through TGF-β/Smad-regulated extracellular matrix degradation and dopaminergic deficiency via downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Microbial metabolic interaction analyses revealed that Megamonas-derived short-chain fatty acids suppressed PI3K-Akt/HDAC signaling (β = −0.27 ± 0.08, P = 0.002). In contrast, the risk-associated taxon Prevotella massilia elevated oxidative stress markers via indole-3-acetate/AhR activation (β = 0.34 ± 0.12, P = 0.009).
               
                  Conclusion
                  This first MR-biological annotation study revealed a degree of congruence between microbiota-associated host genes and the PI3K-Akt/Ras-driven scleral-immune dysregulation in ocular signaling pathways. The findings of Megamonas-derived SCFAs as therapeutic targets provide a viable approach for addressing myopia through microbiome intervention.},

The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset was used to train and evaluate three popular machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Feature selection methods were applied to optimize model performance, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Mutual Information. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models. The results showed that the SVM classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 98 %, compared to 95.8 % for RF and 96.2 % for k-NN. The SVM model demonstrated a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.95 for malignant cases. Feature selection revealed that mean radius, texture, and area were the most influential features, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirmed their clinical relevance in breast cancer diagnosis. A tumor-immune dynamic model also indicated that treatment efficacy (γ = 0.0500/day) was a critical parameter for tumor control. Statistical significance tests (p < 0.05) confirmed that the SVM classifier outperformed the other models. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with clinical insights to develop an effective framework for breast cancer prediction, offering high diagnostic accuracy and biological interpretability.},

This decision has a profound effect on overall production efficiency, as it directly influences subsequent balancing and scheduling decisions. The integration of collaborative robots (cobots) into these environments further complicates this task. Despite its significance, the joint consideration of model-line assignment and robotic line balancing has received limited attention in the literature. This study addresses this gap by formulating the robotic mixed-model multiple assembly line balancing problem with simultaneous model-line assignment (MLA-RMMALB) and proposing a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model.

To handle the complexity of the problem, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed as a solution approach. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical example involving 21 tasks and benchmark problems from the literature. Solutions obtained under integrated model-line assignment are compared with random assignment scenarios, revealing significant performance gains in both objectives. NSGA-II proves capable of delivering optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently for small- and medium-sized instances, and high-quality results for larger problems. This study contributes to literature by addressing critical challenges in multi-line mixed-model production by jointly considering model-line assignment, cobot heterogeneity, and the parallel operation of cobots and human workers. It proposes NSGA-II as an effective solution method for this complex problem. Practically, the study provides a decision-support tool for manufacturers aiming to optimize both cost-efficiency and environmental performance in robotic assembly systems. The findings are especially relevant for industries adopting cobots in high-variety production environments where these factors must be simultaneously managed.},

However, the identification of key bioactive metabolites and the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The study aimed to identify the bioactive metabolites profile in vivo and elucidate the mechanisms underlying their anti-CRC effects. Initially, a UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS technique was integrated with a feature-based molecular networking approach to annotate 26 prototype metabolites in rat serum. Subsequently, a preliminary evaluation of the anti-CRC effect of the serum was conducted. Thereafter, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were employed to investigate the potential mechanisms and to screen for bioactive metabolites. Following this, the signal pathways of the primary bioactive metabolites were validated through cell experiments. Our findings suggested that the candidate targets of those prototypes’ metabolites were implicated in the PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, cell experiments demonstrated that LR-containing serum could inhibit the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of HCT-116 cells. Molecular docking and dynamics analyses indicated significant binding affinity and stability between the core targets and bioactive metabolites, such as luteolin and esculin. The bioactive metabolites of LR are potential material bases for anti-CRC via the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, offering new insights for the functional development and utilisation of LR.},

  abstract = {The TAM (Tyro3, AXL, and Mer) receptor tyrosine kinases play vital roles in immunity and various complex diseases, particularly cancer. In this family, AXL has stood out as a promising target for therapeutic development due to its significant role in cancer progression and resistance to therapies. AXL and its ligand GAS6 promote metastasis and therapeutic resistance in several human cancers. Dysregulated AXL signaling is implicated in a spectrum of diseases, notably metastatic cancer. Elevated AXL expression correlates with drug resistance and poor survival in multiple cancers such as lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, colon, and melanoma. In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of phytochemicals sourced from the IMPPAT 2.0 database of Indian medicinal plants to identify potential AXL inhibitors. Preliminary screening was performed based on the physicochemical properties of the phytochemicals, followed by their interaction studies in molecular docking with AXL. Of 17,908 phytochemicals initially screened, 11,676 drug-like compounds complied with Lipinski’s rule-of-five and were subjected to molecular docking and downstream analyses. Subsequent evaluation included ADMET analysis, PAINS examination, and PASS analysis to identify potent hits against AXL. From this screening, Neogitogenin and Solaspigenin emerged as promising candidates demonstrating favorable drug-like properties and significant binding potential with the AXL binding pocket. Neogitogenin and Solaspigenin showed binding affinities of −10.1 to −10.8 kcal/mol, favorable ADMET profiles, and with RMSD values ranging between 0.32 and 0.38 nm, indicating stable binding. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation over 200 ns revealed stable protein-ligand complexes with some minor conformational fluctuations. This study suggests that, after further experimentation, modulating AXL with natural compounds holds promise for combating human malignancies, potentially overcoming limitations of existing synthetic inhibitors such as R428.},

In this study, we employedmachine learning-based virtual screening along with structure-based drug design to identify potential SphK1 inhibitors with diverse chemical scaffolds. A total of 16 machine learning models were generated using molecular fingerprints, and the most effective models were employed to conductvirtual screening of the Maybridge library. The screened compounds were then subjected to molecular docking to determine a suitable docked pose against the SphK1 protein. Upon visualization of the best docked compounds, we found that six compounds exhibited strong interactions with the SphK1 protein compared to the control (SQS). To further support our findings, we conducted 100 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all six compounds to analyzeconformational changes and stability. Two compounds (SCR00139 and SCR00133) demonstratedpromising stability and fit well within the binding pocket of the SphK1 protein. Furthermore, MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA studies were carried out on these two compounds, providing favorable relative binding estimations. This study introduces an integrated pipeline of machine learning-based virtual screening for the identification of new scaffolds targeting cancer progression.

To optimize workflow efficiency and improve diagnosis accuracy, we develop an automated deep learning model, called EA-ResMLP, which integrates a residual multilayer perceptron with squeeze-and-excitation attention block and explainable artificial intelligence. The integration of residual connections and attention mechanisms contributes to improved diagnostic accuracy by enabling deeper feature learning and emphasizing the most informative features through adaptive recalibration. The experimental results demonstrated that proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.05%, indicating a 7.98% improvement over the conventional multilayer perceptron. Furthermore, the predictions of the EA-ResMLP model are analyzed using explainable artificial intelligence techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, which generate feature contribution charts to highlight the impact of each input feature on the prediction. By integrating model predictions with feature contribution charts, the proposed model provides an explainable framework for ovarian cancer detection.},

These molecules exhibit the unique characteristic of forming complexes with Cu(II), Ru(III), and VO(II) metal ions, resulting in distinct metal-organic structures.Structural characterization was performed using elemental analysis, magnetic properties measurement, FT-IR spectroscopy, and electronic spectroscopy. Moreover, the stoichiometry in solution was determined through both continuous variation and molar ratio analysis.

Conversely, the vanadyl (VO) complex demonstrates a distinct square pyramidal structure.Density functional theory (DFT) computations were employed to confirm the geometrical configurations of the prepared complexes. The synthesized BIA ligand and its corresponding metal complexes were assessed for their in vitro antimicrobial. The results indicated that the RuBIA complex emerged as the most efficacious agent against both bacterial and fungal growth, outperforming established medications like Ofloxacin and Fluconazole as standard drugs with sequenceBIA < VOBIA < CuBIA <RuBIAcomplex.Additionally, the study evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds against Hep-G2, MCF-7, and HCT-116 cancer cell lines.

To address this, we propose a deep learning based multitask learning framework that integrates multi modal biological data to simultaneously predict drug pair synergy scores and individual drug response outcomes. The model incorporates molecular descriptors and drug induced gene expression signatures to represent drugs, while untreated cancer cell lines are encoded through their gene expression profiles. A hybrid architecture based on bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) layers and attention mechanisms is employed to capture complex interactions between drug features and cell line characteristics. The fused representation is passed through mutual attention layers to model intricate dependencies, and the resulting output is used to jointly predict the synergy score and the individual responses of each drug.

Thus, there is a recognized need for cosmeceuticals that modulate inflammation pathways to prevent and treat aging. In this sense, four bioactive compounds were selected for their documented anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether the bioactive compounds astaxanthin, curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol are effective in treating the effects of skin aging, using in silico analyses. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) related to skin aging and the bioactive compounds astaxanthin, curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol were generated using the Cytoscape plug-in to analyze the functional enrichment of recovered proteins. From these main networks, clusters and bottleneck networks were generated. Initially, 5 main PPINs were generated. From the clusters recovered from the main networks, 3 were selected from the general network and 11 from the specific networks. Through functional enrichment of the clusters, the biological process of response to oxidative stress was identified. Blood and blood-forming tissue, vascular, and immune system abnormality phenotypes were also observed, along with an increase in inflammatory response. Additionally, Reactome pathways related to interleukin signaling and detoxification of reactive oxygen species were noted. Finally, the key genes for each network were identified from the bottleneck networks: IL-6 (general and astaxanthin), TAB1 (curcumin), TNF-α (quercetin), and TP53 (resveratrol). Based on this research, the analyzed bioactive compounds suggest potential efficacy to be included in cosmetic products, as they are capable of reducing excessive oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, consequently preventing cellular aging.},

                  Neurodevelopmental anomalies are features of drug-induced ASD and often accompany behavioural challenges. A promising approach to mitigating the side effects of antiepileptic treatments involves nutraceuticals and fortified foods. Experimental investigations are laborious, but molecular modelling, including docking and dynamics simulations, elucidates compatibility between drugs and food phytonutrients at the atomic level.

  abstract = {Modeling cellular perturbation responses is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. However, current computational approaches face significant challenges when learning from sparse, noisy, high-dimensional, and size-limited scRNA-seq data. These limitations hinder their ability to capture complex cellular heterogeneity and perturbation dynamics, leading to poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. Recent advances in single-cell foundation models (scFMs) offer a promising solution by providing biologically meaningful representations. Inspired by the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA) in generative diffusion models, we propose scREPA, a novel framework for single-cell perturbation prediction that aligns the internal representations of a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based model with high-quality external representations from pretrained scFMs. Specifically, scREPA aligns VAE latent embeddings from noisy gene expression profiles with biologically meaningful embeddings from scFMs. We also propose Cycle-Consistent Representation Alignment by aligning the re-encoded embeddings of VAE-generated gene expression profiles with both original scFM representations and initial VAE embeddings, enforcing dual consistency and further improving representation quality. During inference, scREPA applies optimal transport to align the distributions of unpaired control and perturbed data, enabling robust prediction of cellular responses by minimizing mismatch. Experiments on diverse datasets show that scREPA outperforms existing methods in predicting both top differentially expressed genes and whole-transcriptome responses while generalizing well to unseen conditions, cross-study settings, and maintaining strong performance under noisy or limited data.},

The identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic candidates is essential for improving patient outcomes. This study employed an integrative bioinformatics and molecular simulation approach to uncover key gene signatures and explore potential plant-based therapeutics for HCC. Gene expression profiles from the GEO dataset GSE121248 were analyzed using R-based statistical tools to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Key hub genes were selected through protein–protein interaction network analysis and functional enrichment. Three hub genesCOL1A1, NQO1, and FOS—were identified, and their expression was validated using the TCGA, GEPIA, and HPA databases. Notably, COL1A1 and NQO1 were upregulated in tumor tissues and associated with poor survival outcomes, while FOS was downregulated. To identify therapeutic candidates, bioactive compounds from Astragalus membranaceus were screened using ADMET profiling. Selected compounds were docked with the hub proteins, and molecular dynamics simulations, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations, and quantum chemical descriptors were employed to evaluate stability and reactivity. Among the candidates, isorhamnetin demonstrated strong and stable binding to all three hub targets, suggesting its potential as a multi-target inhibitor for HCC therapy. These findings provide new insights into HCC pathogenesis and propose isorhamnetin as a promising natural compound for further experimental validation.},

  abstract = {The development of efficient separation methods is essential for the production of fine chemicals and materials. Among them, the aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) allows for the isolation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of specific structures and other substances. However, this easy-to-use method, in which an analyte is partitioned between two phases, still demands a better understanding of its mechanism to make its application more effective. Herein, we demonstrate how various biphasic systems can be formed according to the nature of the phase-forming components. Moreover, by employing polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPEG), previously unrecognized in this context, we reveal the versatility of nonionic polymers for ATPE, which can successfully act as phase-forming compounds, partitioning modulators, and dispersing agents. Interestingly, as proven by experiments and modelling, PEPEG exhibited chirality-sensitive preference toward SWCNTs, which can significantly facilitate the purification of SWCNTs using various approaches. Capitalizing on this finding, we report how the extraction environment may be tailored to promote the isolation of (8,3) SWCNTs and other chirality-enriched SWCNT fractions. The relationships noted, based on the examination of a model material (SWCNTs), provide substantial insight into the elusive mechanism of the ATPE purification approach, widely employed across a range of analytes, from cell organelles to nanostructures.},

  abstract = {This work considers the numerical computation of ground states of rotating Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) which can exhibit a multiscale lattice of quantized vortices. This problem involves the minimization of an energy functional on a Riemannian manifold. For this we apply the framework of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of Sobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous work that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients methods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy. In this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special attention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search direction and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As known from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum parameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor. Besides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the methods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a standard H 0 1 -metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the numerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed adaptive metric along with a Polak–Ribiére or Hestenes–Stiefel-type momentum parameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the other CG methods that were part of our numerical study.},

Current pharmacological interventions remain limited in efficacy, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Si-Miao-Yong-An Decoction (SMYAD), a classical formula in traditional Chinese medicine, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and vascular-protective effects, yet its underlying mechanisms in AAA treatment remain unclear. This study employed an integrative approach combining network pharmacology, machine learning, and molecular modeling to elucidate the pharmacological basis of SMYAD against AAA. A total of 106 bioactive compounds and 235 putative targets were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database. These were cross-referenced with disease-associated and differentially expressed genes from GEO datasets, identifying 15 targets potentially involved in AAA pathogenesis. Functional enrichment analyses revealed their involvement in the interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways. Integrated PPI network analysis and 3 machine learning algorithms jointly identified 6 hub genes (IL6, PTGS2, IL1B, FOS, MAOA, and COL1A1) as central to AAA pathology. Gene expression profiling and ROC curve analysis further supported the diagnostic relevance of these targets. Five key compounds—quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and stigmasterol—exhibited strong binding affinities with the identified hub targets. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions between the selected compounds and their targets. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the multi-target actions of SMYAD in AAA and offers theoretical support for its potential clinical application.},

By transforming the non-differentiable least-squares (LS) problem inherent in fitting TBR models into an optimization framework, our algorithm combines the optimization of a weighted classification error function for the threshold model with obtaining LS estimators for regression models. To improve the efficiency and flexibility of TBR model estimation, we integrate the weighted support vector machine (WSVM) as a surrogate method for solving the weighted classification problem. The TBR-WSVM algorithm offers several key advantages over recently developed methods: it eliminates pre-specification requirements for threshold parameters, accommodates flexible estimation of nonlinear threshold boundaries, and streamlines the estimation process. We conducted several simulation studies to illustrate the finite-sample performance of TBR-WSVM. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the TBR model through a real data analysis.},

  abstract = {The traditional k-means clustering algorithm is sensitive to initial centroids selection, prone to local optima, and inefficient on large-scale datasets. To address these limitations, this article proposes an Adaptive K-Means algorithm (AK-means) that integrates a density-based initialization strategy and an Improved Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (IQIO) method. Specifically, a novel density-aware initialization approach is introduced to generate initial centroids by evaluating data point sparsity and distance distribution, effectively mitigating centroid deviation, and an enhanced IQIO mechanism. In particular, IQIO is improved through two key innovations, including a dynamic neighborhood search mechanism based on the absolute slope of interpolated points and the position of known optima, which significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional methods; and the incorporation of gradient descent to refine local exploitation, accelerating convergence to high-accuracy solutions. To verify the effectiveness of IQIO, experiments on the CEC2017 benchmark suite demonstrate its superiority over 10 state-of-the-art optimizers, with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, confirming statistically significant improvements in 22 out of 29 test functions. Furthermore, evaluations on 18 UCI datasets reveal that AK-means achieves superior clustering performance compared to 4 baseline methods, achieving lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and reduction in Davies-Bouldin Index (DB) compared to traditional k-means, particularly on large-scale data. These results highlight the algorithm's ability to balance cluster compactness and separation while maintaining scalability for high-dimensional data. The proposed hybrid optimization strategy provides a better program for real-world applications requiring efficient and precise clustering of large-scale datasets.},

This study evaluates the cardioprotective potential of esculetin, a natural coumarin derivative, against DOX-induced cardiac injury in rats. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups, including control, DOX, esculetin (50 and 100 mg/kg), and combination treatments. DOX markedly altered the expression of oxidative stress-related genes (Ache, Ar, Sord upregulated; Pon1, Gst downregulated) and impaired enzyme activities, accompanied by increased malondialdehyde and depleted glutathione levels. Esculetin administration, particularly at 100 mg/kg, reversed these molecular and biochemical disturbances, restoring antioxidant defense and normalizing gene expression. Molecular docking revealed strong binding interactions of esculetin with the active sites of key enzymes including AR, SORD, AChE, GST, and PON1, supporting its regulatory role. These findings suggest that esculetin exerts multi-targeted protective effects and may serve as a promising candidate for mitigating chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.

  abstract = {Epilepsy, a neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide, has driven the development of various antiseizure medications (ASMs). Isoguvacine (IGV), a potent and selective agonist of the GABAA receptor (GABAAR), has shown potential in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. However, its low blood-brain barrier permeability impairs its ability to act effectively within the central nervous system. To address this limitation, two novel ester derivatives of IGV, E7 and E14, were synthesized via Steglich esterification and evaluated through an integrated computational framework comprising density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and in silico ADMET predictions. DFT analysis revealed that esterification significantly modified the electronic properties of IGV, with E14 exhibiting the highest polarizability (225.895 Å³) and smallest energy gap (–0.155 eV), indicative of enhanced reactivity. Molecular docking demonstrated that GABA (–8.46 kcal/mol) and IGV (–8.35 kcal/mol) exhibit similar binding affinity and complex stability with GABAAR, supporting the reliability of our computational approach. MD simulations further confirmed the stability of these complexes, where lower RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values indicated that binding of GABA and IGV did not induce significant conformational changes in the overall receptor structure. Moreover, the derivatives were projected to exhibit optimal intestinal absorption (>90%), oral bioavailability, as well as favorable safety profiles with minimal interaction risks and non-carcinogenic properties. Collectively, these in silico findings highlight the potential of ester prodrug design to overcome the central pharmacokinetic limitations of IGV, with E14 emerging as the most promising ASM candidate for further experimental development in epilepsy therapy. Beyond identifying therapeutic advantages of E14, this study also underscores the broader value of integrated computational approaches as powerful and predictive tools in early-stage drug discovery for neurological disorders.},

The probe DSM-O was found to possess excellent resistance to interference and remarkable viscosity responsiveness. Importantly, it was effectively applied in the bioimaging of acute alcoholic liver injury, indicating its great promise as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for early-stage liver damage.},

While East Asian strains have been well studied, Indian populations remain under-characterized. This study explores the genetic and functional diversity of five Indian-origin L. edodes strains (DMRO-34, DMRO-35, DMRO-356, DMRO-388s, and DMRO-623) using multilocus sequence analysis targeting ITS, LSU, TEF1-α, and β-tubulin regions (660–1200 bp). Phylogenetic analyses (neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference) revealed three well-supported clusters (bootstrap > 90 %; posterior probability > 0.95). AMOVA (p < 0.01) and diversity indices confirmed significant genetic differentiation. DMRO-356 and DMRO-388s showed close genetic relatedness and phenotypic consistency, while DMRO-623 was genetically distinct. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in genes linked to stress response, metabolism, and β-glucan biosynthesis. Transcriptomic profiling showed higher expression of β-glucan synthesis genes (FKS1, GLS2) in DMRO-356 and DMRO-388s, indicating potential for nutraceutical use. DMRO-623 exhibited upregulation of stress-responsive genes (SOD, HSP70), suggesting adaptation to environmental stress and suitability for resilient cultivation. Compared to traditional markers (RAPD, SSR), the multilocus approach offered improved resolution for distinguishing closely related strains. Strong correlations (r = 0.80–0.88) between genetic variation and key traits (β-glucan content, antioxidant activity, yield) emphasize the functional significance of the observed diversity. This first multilocus-based study of Indian-origin L. edodes strains provides a genomic framework for marker-assisted breeding, trait optimization, and conservation, supporting their commercial and ecological value in diverse environments.},

The MLPT architecture takes the input features from the Adaptive Depthwise Multi-Kernel Atrous Module (ADMAM) as inputs to the Swin Transformer, and the output of Swin block 1 is concatenated with the features extracted from the Kolaskar-Tongaonkar algorithm with the SA-BWK model. This hierarchical integration enhances feature representation and predictive capability. Advanced feature extraction, coupled with optimized feature selection for the MLPT model improves its performance over the conventional approach in the identification of reduced-complexity antigenic determinants.},

  abstract = {B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults, progressing rapidly and requiring urgent clinical intervention. Late-stage diagnosis often results in reduced survival rates and typically depends on costly, time-intensive diagnostic procedures. Peripheral blood smear (PBS) imaging plays a central role in the preliminary screening of B-ALL and provides an accessible foundation for computer-assisted diagnosis. To support early and efficient classification, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify B-ALL subtypes directly from PBS images without the need for pre-segmentation. The model is computationally efficient, comprising only 986,126 trainable parameters, and integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules within Inverted Residual Blocks to strengthen feature representation. Experimental results demonstrated excellent classification performance, achieving 100 % accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). To further assess generalizability, cross-dataset validation was performed on the independent Blood Cells Cancer (ALL) dataset without retraining or fine-tuning, yielding a robust accuracy of 99.85 %. Model interpretability was performed using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which provided visual explanations and highlighted key discriminative cellular features, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers a highly accurate, resource-efficient, and interpretable solution for B-ALL classification, underscoring its strong potential for integration into real-world clinical practice.

These findings highlight the pressing need to evaluate hERG blockade during drug development. We propose a novel framework for feature extraction and aggregation optimization (FEAOF), which primarily consists of a feature extraction module and an aggregation optimization module. The model integrates diverse ligand representations, including molecular fingerprints, descriptors, and graphs, as well as ligand–receptor interaction features. Based on this integration, we further optimize the algorithmic framework to achieve precise predictions of compounds cardiac toxicity. Two independent test sets exhibiting pronounced structural dissimilarity from the training data were constructed to rigorously assess the model’s generalization ability. The results demonstrate that the FEAOF model exhibits strong robustness compared to seven baseline models, achieving F1 score of 66.1 % and 68.1 %. Notably, when benchmarked against five existing models on two external test sets, FEAOF also achieved the highest or near-highest scores across all key evaluation metrics. Importantly, this model can be easily adapted for other drug-target interaction prediction tasks.

Due to experimental limitations in capturing spatial thermal distributions within and beneath the pile, as well as the thermal response of individual firebrands within the pile. This study employed a numerical approach to investigate the thermal performance of smouldering firebrand accumulations. The model examined the effects of varying wind speeds (0.9–2.7 m/s) and coverage densities (0.06 and 0.16 g/cm2) on firebrand surface temperature, released heat flux, and heat flux received by the substrate. Model accuracy was verified by comparing its output with the heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) derived from an experimental study, ensuring the reliability of the numerical data. Results showed that increased wind speeds and coverage densities significantly increase both average and localized thermal parameters. For smouldering firebrand accumulations, peak average total heat flux to the substrate ranged from 19 to 52 kW/m2, while localized regions within the pile reached up to 120 kW/m2. These findings demonstrate the importance of spatial thermal analysis in characterizing firebrand pile behaviour.},

  abstract = {There is a significant need for computer experiments to study and model complex physical systems. In both computer and physical experiments, constructing experimental designs with good space-filling and column-orthogonality properties is crucial. While maximin distance designs and uniform designs ensure space-filling in full-dimensional spaces, they lack guarantees for low-dimensional projections. Uniform projection designs address this gap by ensuring space-filling properties in low-dimensional subspaces. Orthogonal designs enable efficient factor screening in Gaussian processes and ensure uncorrelated estimates of main effects in linear models. However, constructing such optimal designs remains challenging. A design that combines these advantages would outperform individual approaches. This paper fills this gap by proposing seven novel theoretical techniques for constructing orthogonal maximin distance uniform projection designs. The proposed designs demonstrate superior performance as the number of factors increases, making them particularly well-suited for surrogate modeling and linear trend estimation in high-dimensional Gaussian processes. Comparative studies show that the proposed techniques outperform existing methods.},

By exploiting problem’s composite structure, we propose an improved version of the proximal alternating linearized minimization method. This algorithm employs a splitting technique, where the nonsmooth subproblem defined in the Euclidean space is solved using a forward–backward operator, and the smooth manifold subproblem is addressed using a Riemannian gradient step. We further extend this algorithm by introducing an inertial Bregman variant, which incorporates inertial step and Bregman regularization to improve both efficiency and robustness.

While previous methods proposed heuristic time-weighting schemes, our approach is grounded in theoretical insights derived from the Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations over time. This principled methodology automatically adjusts weights based on the stability regime of the system — whether chaotic, periodic, or stable. Numerical experiments on challenging benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz system and the Burgers’ equation, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to existing techniques, our approach offers improved convergence and accuracy without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. The findings underline the importance of incorporating causality and dynamical system behavior into PINN training strategies, providing a robust framework for solving time-dependent problems with enhanced reliability.},

The simulations were conducted using PHITS code in a water-based spherical phantom model to investigate energy deposition, collision parameters, and particle transport behavior. Complementary photon attenuation parameters, including mass attenuation coefficients, half-value layers, atomic cross-sections, and exposure buildup factors, were also calculated using Phy-X/PSD. The results show distinct differences in the physical interaction profiles of the compounds, with Calicheamicin demonstrating notably higher photon attenuation and energy deposition, likely due to the presence of high-Z elements in its structure. These findings are based on Monte Carlo-based simulation results and are intended to provide a foundational understanding of the physical interaction mechanisms of radiomimetic materials under photon irradiation.

Metal distribution was predicted using first-principles-based thermodynamics simulations and compared with experimental results. Moreover, phase stability, microstructure, and mechanical properties were evaluated for all of the ceramics. Compositions containing Cr, V, Nb, or Ta formed dual-phase ceramics containing only one boride and one carbide phase, while compositions containing Mo or W developed an additional third phase. The experimental metal distribution trends generally aligned with thermodynamic predictions, except for compositions containing V, which showed unexpected segregation behavior that was influenced by complex interactions of the coexistence of boride and carbide structures. From the dual-phase ceramics, the composition containing V exhibited the highest hardness (HV1 = 25.5 ± 0.6 GPa) combined with smaller grain sizes (0.99 ± 0.33 μm for the boride and 1.15 ± 0.31 μm for the carbide phases). Our findings provide insights into phase formation and elemental segregation and help the design of next-generation dual-phase UHTCs with tailored properties.},

  abstract = {Bioavailable testosterone (BAT), a critical factor for reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health, is primarily regulated by sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). However, the molecular mechanisms driving SHBG-mediated regulation of BAT remain unclear. Identifying key protein regulators offers promising therapeutic opportunities for testosterone-related disorders. We conducted a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (PWMR) and colocalization analysis using large-scale pQTL and GWAS datasets. Mediation MR assessed SHBG’s role in regulating BAT, and functional enrichment, protein interaction networks, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), and drug prediction were performed to explore therapeutic relevance and safety. We identified 36 proteins that influence BAT via SHBG mediation. Among them, five proteins (MAX, TXNL4B, GLRX2, F13B, SNUPN) showed strong or moderate colocalization with BAT, suggesting shared genetic regulation. MAX and TXNL4B increased BAT by reducing SHBG, while GLRX2, F13B, and SNUPN decreased BAT via elevated SHBG levels. PheWAS suggested potential risks for GLRX2 (depression) and TXNL4B (lipid disorders). Drug and compound prediction highlighted compounds, including cardiac glycosides, antioxidants, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, targeting these proteins. Our findings reveal novel protein regulators of testosterone bioavailability through SHBG and provide a framework for developing targeted therapeutics. This integrative approach may support safer, more precise treatment strategies for testosterone-related metabolic and endocrine disorders.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is paramount for preventing adverse drug events and ensuring patient safety. While existing computational methods show promise, they often struggle to effectively model long-range intramolecular dependencies and identify the most salient substructures for interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce TK-DDI, a novel deep learning framework based on molecular tokenization. TK-DDI first converts drug molecules into sequences of tokens, creating a unified representation that captures both 2D structural and 3D conformational information. A Transformer encoder is then employed to learn the contextual relationships between all token pairs, effectively modeling the influence of distant functional groups. To elucidate the interaction mechanism, TK-DDI incorporates a two-stage attention strategy: an intra-drug attention module to highlight key substructures within each molecule, followed by an inter-drug attention module to fuse the representations of the drug pair. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TK-DDI robustly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new standard for DDI prediction.},

Density functional theory (DFT) was used in this work to explore the therapeutic potential of carbon nanocone oxide (ONC) as a drug carrier for Favipiravir (FPV) against viral infection. The Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMOs) defined the bandgap as a decline from 5.52 to 5.36 eV of Favipiravir when interacting with ONC. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces revealed that in the FPV-ONC complex, the Favipiravir acts as nucleophile and ONC as electrophile. The FMOs also calculated quantum chemical parameters in the gas and solvent phases to confirm the correlation between Favipiravir and ONC stabilization energy in complex formation. The density of state and charge deposition analysis showed the charge transfer phenomenon during complex formation. NBO, ELF, NCI, and iso-surfaces were used to identify the charge transfer between Favipiravir and ONC. The excited states were analyzed by plotting the TDM and spectral investigation (Raman, UV-Vis, IR, and NMR) of FPV, ONC, and FPV-ONC. The drug-carrier interaction generated fluorescence quenching in PET, which also gave a pictorial description of the unique excited states from 1 to 10. The results collectively indicate the therapeutic potential of the ONC carrier as a favipiravir carrier for managing viral disease.},

  abstract = {The currently marketed antitubercular drugs have limited efficacy with the potential to cause organ toxicity. Thus, there is a need for new drug therapies to combat tuberculosis. Methyl 2-(7-hydroxy-3-methyloctyl)-1,3-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohex-2-enecarboxylate (PE14) and (E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-en-1-ol (EA8) are the natural antitubercular lead-like molecules isolated from petroleum ether and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of Ipomea sepiaria, respectively. Extensive research has demonstrated the wide range of health benefits associated with this plant. However, the antitubercular effects of phytocompounds isolated from this species have not been systematically investigated. To evaluate the antitubercular effect of the natural compound, in silico prediction of binding affinity against selected antitubercular target proteins was conducted, and this was compared with co-crystallized ligands as a standard. Additionally, the physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and various toxicity-related parameters were also predicted. Two ligand docking complexes were selected for molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the binding free energy over 250 ns. Moreover, FMO and DFT were also investigated. PE14 complies with RO5 and exhibits suitable ADMET profiles. The molecular docking scores in kcal/mol showed comparatively more potency against antitubercular drug targets compared to the co-crystalized ligand of the target protein as well as EA8. Overall, the strength of interaction between the ligands with their selected target proteins from the molecular docking study, heat change that occurs during the ligand-target interactions from a molecular dynamic simulation study, the electronic reactivity trend was established as STD > PE14 > CIP > EA8 from FMO analysis and other multi-parametric druggability profiles of target proteins suggests that PE14 can be considered as a suitable antitubercular lead-like for the treatment of M. tuberculosis. The results of the current study were closely correlated with those of our previous study on Ipomea sepiaria in the LRP assay. However, necessary in vitro and in vivo studies on the synthesized pure compound must be carried out to participate in a clinical trial, where the in silico results would help expedite the process of drug development.},

  abstract = {Treatment resistance and leukemic stem cell survival are significant challenges in managing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). While Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson (BCR::ABL1) fusion drives disease initiation, emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate critical cellular processes that promote leukemic transformation and treatment failure. We employed a comprehensive in silico approach integrating multiple omics platforms to investigate CML-associated lncRNAs. Candidate lncRNAs were identified by cross-referencing LncRNA Disease and LncTarD repositories, followed by validation expression analysis of data in leukemia transcriptomic cohorts. StarBase and miRWalk algorithms predicted the interaction networks between lncRNAs and microRNAs, while transcription factor (TF) binding was determined through ChIP-seq analysis and TF databases to map the regulatory networks governing lncRNA and miRNA expression. Four critical long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), H19, HOTAIR, MEG3, and UCA1, were differentially expressed in CML and were involved in regulating proliferation, cell death, and therapeutic response pathways. Network analysis revealed extensive regulatory interactions with microRNAs, especially hsa-miR-18a-5p and hsa-miR-106b-5p, which influence major oncogenic pathways. TFs mapping identified pivotal hubs, including MYC and STAT5A, as key regulators of lncRNA and miRNA networks, which contribute to disrupted normal growth control, and apoptotic and survival pathways in leukemic cells. This study identified a non-coding RNA interactome in CML involving lncRNAs and microRNAs that may cooperatively contribute to CML progression. These interconnected circuits offer novel insights into treatment resistance and stem cell persistence, identifying promising therapeutic targets. Future validation of these interactions may guide the development of non-coding RNA–targeted therapies for resistant CML.},

  abstract = {The pervasive challenges in cancer management, ranging from accurate early diagnosis to effective personalised therapies and precise patient stratification, represent significant clinical unmet needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cancer research by offering unprecedented capabilities in analysing complex genomic datasets. AI has completely transformed omics research by simplifying the integration of multi-omics data, offering more profound insights into cancer heterogeneity, and enhancing predictive models for patient treatment responses. In the past decade, numerous studies have highlighted how AI has revolutionised omics research. AI models are instrumental in enhancing oncology by addressing these unmet needs through improved clinical trial matching, refined risk assessment, and precise treatment selection. They contribute to more personalised and effective cancer care by classifying cancer types and subtypes, identifying biomarkers, predicting drug responses, stratifying patients, and analysing tumour evolution and heterogeneity. This comprehensive review specifically focuses on the development and validation of AI-powered multi-omics language models for cancer genomics. We posit that the integration of diverse omics data types provides synergistic insights beyond single-omics approaches, which are critical for unravelling cancer heterogeneity and addressing the complex challenges within cancer genomics. The review highlights recent advances, current difficulties, and potential paths forward for these integrated AI approaches. We also detail the main elements of these models, such as their architectures, training plans, evaluation techniques, and data preprocessing.

Recent studies have shown that the small molecule ONO-0740556 can effectively disrupt the overall structure of LPA1 in solution; however, its effects in a native membrane environment remain unclear. According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMS), Dan Shen(Salvia miltiorrhiza) exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-pulmonary fibrosis properties, and its natural compound cryptoxanthin may serve as a novel LPA1 inhibitor. Here, we employed microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to systematically compare the structural modulation of LPA1 by ONO-0740556 and cryptoxanthin in a membrane environment. The results indicate that both ligands enlarge the entrance of the LPA1 ligand-binding channel, weaken the interactions between transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) and other structural communities, and reduce hydrophobic interactions between LPA1 and the membrane, thereby inducing membrane structural perturbations. Notably, cryptoxanthin exerts a more pronounced effect in widening the binding channel and selectively attenuating TM7–community interactions. These findings provide atomic-level insights into how small molecules modulate LPA1 structure in its physiologically relevant membrane environment. Such mechanistic understanding not only offers a theoretical basis for the rational design of LPA1-targeted therapeutics but also supports the discovery of natural product–derived inhibitors as viable drug candidates. Moreover, our results highlight potential allosteric sites and dynamic features of LPA1 that could be exploited to develop highly selective modulators, paving the way for more precise therapeutic interventions against LPA1-related diseases.},

Integrating multi-omics biological data offers a comprehensive and intricate understanding of biological processes, disease mechanisms, and cancer subtyping, rendering it an influential tool for scientific research. Nevertheless, current approaches to integrating multi-omics data often fail to consider the scale of data in feature information and overlook the analysis of the individual and shared feature expressions in multi-omics data. The proposed study introduces a Multiview-Cooperated graph neural network (MCgnn), an end-to-end cancer subtype classifier that effectively integrates and analyzes complex multi-omics data. Firstly, MCgnn innovatively constructs a similarity network using Mahalanobis distance and density methods. Then, by employing stacked graph convolution layers, MCgnn effectively captures potential local structural features. Subsequently, MCgnn extracts and fuses complementary information from different omics data through the attention mechanism among views to achieve effective integration of multiple views and attain higher classification performance. Finally, MCgnn performs multi-task learning across omics data using a cross-omics tensor to seamlessly integrate the feature learning component with the classification component. Experiments on four publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were conducted to demonstrate that MCgnn outperforms most comparison classification algorithms in effectively addressing the cancer subtype classification problem and exhibits remarkable robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, MCgnn was employed to identify pivotal biomarkers in cancer, providing a valuable reference for precision medicine.},

Few studies have explored AUD-induced changes in proteins to repurpose drugs that interfere with alcohol withdrawal symptoms and relapse. This multi-level analysis identified the most prevalent changes in protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of individuals with AUD and identified candidate drugs with potential benefits for its treatment. We searched databases for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the PFC of individuals with AUD and matched controls, to identify hub and bottleneck genes through a protein-protein interaction network and topological analysis. DrugBank was used to provide candidate drugs targeting the key genes obtained. Metascape was used for gene annotations and functional enrichment analysis. Most DEPs identified in the PFC of individuals with AUD were downregulated (68 %) and were associated with metabolic processes, including aerobic respiration, vesicle-mediated transport, and cellular responses to stress. We also identified key genes through survival analysis, particularly GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and ACTB (Actin Beta). The DrugBank database identified that artenimol and quercetin are potential candidate drugs for interacting with key genes in the PFC of individuals with AUD. Thus, reduced PFC metabolism may alter executive functions, decision-making, and behaviors in individuals with AUD. Proteomic and multi-level analysis are valuable tools for identifying brain dysfunction and new therapeutic targets in AUD.},

Emphasizing the detection of genuine signals while controlling false positives is crucial, especially for identifying shifts in location parameters within flexible distributions. Traditional parametric methods often exhibit sensitivity to outliers and heavy-tailed data. Addressing this limitation, a robust method accommodating diverse data structures is proposed. The approach constructs component-wise sign-based statistics. Leveraging the global symmetry inherent in these statistics enables the derivation of data-driven thresholds suitable for multiple testing scenarios. Method development occurs within the framework of U-statistics, which naturally encompasses existing cumulative sum-based procedures. Theoretical guarantees establish FDR control for the component-wise sign-based method under mild assumptions.

Biological activities were evaluated via in vitro assays: the Griess assay for NO inhibition, the p-nitrophenol assay for α-glucosidase, and enzymatic assays for PTP1B. Molecular docking was employed to investigate protein–ligand interactions. The isolates included alanine (1), threonine (2), 2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (3), 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone (4), ibotenic acid (5), serotonin (6), uracil (7), hypoxanthine (8), bufotenine (9), β-sitosterol (10), stigmasterol (11), cycloeucalenol (12), spinasterol (13), daucosterol (14), stigmasterol-3-O-β-D-glucoside (15), and betulin (16). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited weak NO inhibition (IC50 = 68.76 and 52.47 μM). Compound 14 displayed the strongest α-glucosidase inhibition (IC50 = 10.56 μM), while compounds 10–13 and 16 showed moderate effects (IC50 = 19.52–32.14 μM). Serotonin (6) also had moderate activity (IC50 = 78.23 μM). For PTP1B inhibition, betulin (16) was most potent (IC50 = 16.80 μM), followed by compounds 10, 11, and 13 with weaker activities (IC50 = 36.28–48.17 μM). Overall, selected compounds (1, 2, 10–14, and 16) exhibited promising bioactivities, warranting further docking studies against inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), PTP1B, and 3AJ7. ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) predictions supported favorable pharmacokinetic properties and potential drug-likeness, highlighting these molecules as leads for anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Dementia represents a rapidly rising global health challenge as a progressive neurodegenerative disease with few options for disease-modifyingtreatments. The present studyaimed to explore the leading phytochemicals from Crocus sativus (saffron) and Matricaria chamomilla (chamomile) and apply AI fragmentation on lead phytochemicals to target the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), an expertized target for dementia therapy. Bioactive compounds were screened from ISO 3632–2–2010 (E) specified for saffron and GC-MS specified for chamomile. Protein Network mapping, Density Functional Theory, Molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine thebinding affinity and interactions stability of key phytochemicals with AHR, such as safranal and bisabolone oxide A. In-silico ADMET predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity showed good properties for these molecules. In addition, their structuraland pharmacological properties were optimized to enhance drug-like features by using artificial intelligence (AI) generative model. Collectively, our findings highlight these AI-enhanced phytochemicals as promising AHR modulators with potentially therapeutic activities in pathological pathways that lead toneuroinflammation and oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of dementia. They offer an avenue for additional experimental validation and encourage further investigation of these leads as sources of new therapeutic modalities to treat neurodegenerativediseases.},

  abstract = {Elevated temperatures during gear grinding readily induce workpiece surface quality degradation, diminished machining accuracy, and premature tool wear, consequently constraining processing efficiency and escalating manufacturing costs. Ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (UVAG) technology, as a powerful thermal mitigation strategy, demonstrates considerable promise for enhancing grinding process stability and improving workpiece surface quality. However, a systematic understanding of the influence mechanism of UVAG on the grinding temperature field and its efficacy optimization in gear machining remains inadequately supported by current theoretical and experimental investigations. To address this gap, this study establishes a theoretical model for the temperature field in gear ultrasonic vibration-assisted form grinding (G-UVAG). The model combines a triangular distribution of heat flux density with the unique characteristics of UVAG. The model incorporates the modulation mechanism of ultrasonic vibration on heat flux distribution, thereby enabling a more precise characterization of the transient heat field in the grinding zone. The findings reveal excellent agreement between the flank temperature predicted by the model and experimentally measured values. In contrast to conventional grinding (CG) methods, the G-UVAG technique achieves a reduction of up to 40 % in the maximum temperature observed within the grinding zone. The deviation among simulation and experimental results is constrained within 9.8 % for CG and 12 % for G-UVAG. Furthermore, G-UVAG effectively diminishes the heat-affected zone depth, shortens the duration of the temperature peak within the tooth flank contact zone, and accelerates both the heating and cooling rates. Analysis indicates that ultrasonic vibration not only promotes a more homogeneous distribution of the grinding heat source but also effectively mitigates the risks of thermally induced deformation and surface burn by suppressing localized temperature spikes. This study establishes an essential theoretical basis for precision gear grinding while broadening the application avenues of UVAG technology to support the realization of efficient and high-quality gear production.},

  abstract = {The motor control board has various defects such as inconsistent color differences, incorrect plug-in positions, solder short circuits, and more. These defects directly affect the performance and stability of the motor control board, thereby having a negative impact on product quality. Therefore, studying the defect detection technology of the motor control board is an important means to improve the quality control level of the motor control board. Firstly, the processing methods of digital images about the motor control board were studied, and the noise suppression methods that affect image feature extraction were analyzed. Secondly, a specific model for defect feature extraction and color difference recognition of the tested motor control board was established, and qualified or defective products were determined based on feature thresholds. Thirdly, the search algorithm for defective images was optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on the typical motor control board, and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing established in this paper reached over 99 %. It is suitable for timely image processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line, and achieved efficient defect detection. The defect detection method can not only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the industry.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient temporal splitting scheme coupled with explicit-implicit-null (EIN) method for nonlinear time fractional multiscale diffusion equations with generalized kernel functions. To avoid the iterative method for nonlinear problems at each time step, the idea of EIN is to add and subtract a linear term to the original equation and apply implicit and explicit time marching scheme to the linear damping term and other terms, respectively. To handle the multiscale feature in the linear part, we further introduce a partially explicit temporal splitting scheme and construct two multiscale subspaces by means of the nonlocal multi-continua method to speed up the computation. The splitting schemes treat implicitly the subspace containing the high contrast and explicitly the other. We perform a rigorous stability analysis of the proposed algorithm and give the stability condition. Several numerical experiments are presented to confirm our theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy while reducing computational cost for high contrast problems.},

  abstract = {The accurate identification and classification of medicinal plants are crucial for botanical research, pharmacology, and traditional medicine, where wrong identification or categorization of the plant species may lead to worse medical effects. In this research, MediFlora-Net, a novel Deep Learning (DL) model is created and ideal for the accurate identification of medicinal plants. The proposed MediFlora-Net uses multi-modal DL methodologies, quantum-assisted feature extraction and hybrid ensembling methodologies in constructing the plant recognition model. Besides, the methodology uses Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Proposed Med-Plant-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This makes the framework to be capable of handling multiple imaging modalities such as RGB, and Hyperspectral Botanical Imagery. Also, a new quantum-inspired feature extraction technique is integrated into the model in which quantum probabilistic feature mapping and entanglement-based representation are utilized to extract higher-order botanical features. The framework also includes separate ‘feature fusion’, fine-tuned attention, and probabilistic decision-making. The proposed MediFlora-Net advances medicinal plant identification to greater precision and flexibility for practical use in the conservation of biological diversity, ethnobotanical studies, and pharmacology. This work effectively exploits DL techniques and quantum-inspired approaches to tackle the inherent issues of botanical identification to enable the design of better-advanced systems of plant identification.

  abstract = {In this study, the numerical solutions of the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional mathematical model of cancer chemotherapy are investigated using the Caputo-Fabrizio q-Elzaki homotopy analysis transform technique (CFq-EHATT) and the Caputo-Fabrizio Elzaki Adomian decomposition method (CFEADM). Cancer is a neoplastic disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation. The objective of this work is to develop an accurate and efficient numerical framework for analyzing the dynamics of tumor cells, immune cells, normal cells, and chemotherapeutic drugs under the influence of memory effects inherent in biological systems. The Caputo-Fabrizio fractional operator, which employs an exponential kernel without singularity, is particularly suitable for modeling such memory-dependent processes in cancer progression and treatment response. The proposed methods are applied to a system modeling the interactions among tumor cells, immune cells, normal cells, and chemotherapeutic drugs. The numerical solutions are illustrated through 2D and 3D graphical representations, and comparative simulations are presented in tabular form, demonstrating the efficiency and consistency of the CFq-EHATT and CFEADM. The results highlight the influence of the fractional order on the system dynamics, offering deeper insights into chemotherapy optimization and tumor evolution, thus contributing to the advancement of mathematical oncology.

  abstract = {Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, necessitating the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods. Formaldehyde (FA) has emerged as a potential biomarker for early detection of breast cancer in urine. This study explores the efficacy of boron-nitrogen-doped C60 heterofullerenes (BN(5,6)C58 and BN(6,6)C58) as highly sensitive and selective biosensors for FA detection using density functional theory (DFT). A comprehensive set of electronic, thermodynamic, and quantum chemical descriptors was employed to evaluate the sensing potential. Key computed parameters (including a significantly reduced energy gap (HLG = 0.49 eV), a high adsorption energy (Eads = −12.55 kcal/mol), a favorable Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = −12.73 kcal/mol), an enhanced dipole moment (μ = 7.425 D), increased polarizability (α = 525.640), and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis) collectively confirmed that BN doping significantly enhances the interaction strength with FA, with BN(6,6)C58 exhibiting the highest sensitivity (1.9 ×1017). Electronic property analyses demonstrated a reduced energy gap and enhanced charge transfer in BN(6,6)C58@FA, corroborated by molecular electrostatic potential and NCI analyses. The sensor's rapid recovery time (1.65 ×10−3 s) and high electrical conductivity (16 A.m−2) further underscore its potential for real-time breath analysis. These findings highlight BN(6,6)C58 as a promising candidate for non-invasive breast cancer diagnostics, paving the way for developing advanced electrochemical biosensors.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing global threat, with antibiotic-resistant infections becoming a leading cause of death worldwide. The present study explores natural cyanobacterial compounds as possible inhibitors of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase B (GyrB) which is a verified antibacterial target that is not present in higher eukaryotes. Because of the urgent need for novel antibacterial drugs, we identified nine drug-like candidates using lipinski's rule of five and ADMET profiling. Molecular docking revealed that Biselyngbyaside B and Smenamide A exhibited greater binding affinities in comparison to the co-crystallized inhibitor EOF, with a binding energy of −9.03 kcal/mol. Further molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Biselyngbyaside B-DNA gyrase B complex surpassed both EOF and Smenamide A in terms of structural stability, compactness, and strong hydrogen bonding. Umbrella sampling was employed to estimate the binding free energy from thirty sampling simulations, and Biselyngbyaside B exhibited a significantly favourable ΔG bind of −91.66 kJ/mol, outperforming EOF (-68.93 kJ/mol) and Smenamide A (-36.4 kJ/mol). These findings clearly indicate a stronger and more stable interaction between Biselyngbyaside B and GyrB. Biselyngbyaside B continuously showed better pharmacokinetic characteristics, non-hepatotoxicity, and a greater binding affinity than previously documented DNA gyrase B inhibitors. This study emphasizes the integration of molecular dockings, molecular dynamics simulation, umbrella sampling, and ADMET analysis provided crucial quantitative insights into the identification of potent drug-like candidates for further validation. Overall, the Biselyngbyaside B was found to be the most promising lead compound for novel antibacterial drug development targeting DNA gyrase B.},

  abstract = {Parents of children with ASD face significantly greater parenting challenges than those raising typically developing children due to prolonged exposure to their children’s developmental disorders, emotional distress, and atypical behaviors, underscoring the urgency of addressing their mental health concerns. This study examined the relationship between fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and social anxiety in parents of children with ASD, with a focus on the mediating roles of perceived social support and coping styles. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 585 parents of children with ASD using validated instruments: the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE), the Social Anxiety Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Simple Coping Style Questionnaire. Data were analyzed through SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 25.0 for structural equation modeling. Key findings revealed: (1) FNE directly predicted social anxiety, with significant standardized direct effects of 0.179 and 0.159 across tested models (p < 0.001); (2) Perceived social support, positive coping styles, and negative coping styles each partially mediated the FNE–social anxiety relationship, with indirect effects of 0.035 (95 % CI [0.025, 0.066]), 0.096 (95 % CI [0.181, 0.242]), and 0.110 (95 % CI [0.115, 0.126]), respectively; (3) Significant chain mediation pathways emerged through perceived social support → positive coping styles (effect = 0.008, 95 % CI [0.012, 0.016]) and perceived social support → negative coping styles (effect = 0.014, 95 % CI [0.031, 0.033]). These findings elucidate the mechanisms linking FNE to social anxiety in this population and provide theoretical foundations for targeted interventions to mitigate parental distress.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to address the locking phenomenon in the quasi-static poro-visco-elastic model. Initially, we introduce new variables to reformulate the fluid–solid coupled problem as a fluid–fluid coupled problem. This reformulation inherently circumvents the locking phenomenon in the pressure field. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution by deriving a priori error estimates, identifying invariant quantities, and applying the Galerkin method. Next, we design fully discrete time-stepping schemes by using mixed finite element method with

We analyze both coupled and decoupled time-stepping methods based on these schemes, demonstrating optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the optimal convergence rates and confirm the absence of locking phenomenon.},
